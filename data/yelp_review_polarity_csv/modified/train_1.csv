1,"Food tour was great! Jeremy (our guide) was very informative and entertaining. It was cold so dress warmly! I also expected bite sized tastings from each place, but at the end of the tour, I was rather satisfied. I recommend you doing this tour if  you're not from the area and want to get to know it a little better while eating from local spots."
0,"Food ok. Service consistently poor to awful. Lighting painfully low. \n\nSpecialty burger restaurant whose burger patties are only ok - today dry, rubbery, fairly flavourless though previously better - and flavour combinations pretty mediocre. Assorted deep fried foods are pretty good including the very expensive cheese curds. I had the toadstool burger. The mushrooms and cheese faded away against the charred flavour of the patty which was slightly pink inside and black on the outside. The bun was soggy. The garlic sauce remarkably tasty. For $7.50 ish I felt ripped off. Would recommend getting a cheeseburger to go from five guys to be honest!\n\nService has been poor on previous visits and today was especially bad. \""Emily\"" took her time before she finally came by our table. Then she asked us for our drink orders three times in the space of two minutes. Then a five minute gap... When I said we were ready to order she inexplicably turned around, walked off and disappeared for another five minutes. The rest of the service was adequate in a surly teenage kinda way though she also failed to mention that the cider on the menu was listed incorrectly. When it arrived it was actually peach flavoured and not to my taste at all. However I couldn't be bothered wrestling with her further so can't really blame the restaurant entirely for having suffered through an entire glass of the stuff. \n\nOverall, we will not be returning. Between the dingy lighting (I think meant to create atmosphere...?!!!), the mediocre, overpriced food and the appalling service I would recommend you go elsewhere too."
1,"Really good restaurant, good food, professional service, much better than what was there."
0,the servers are rude especially if you are dining alone. the food was mediocre at best.
0,Went for the buffet on Sunday.  As another reviewer said it was set up weird.  Grew up on German food and this didn't compare. Probably good for a restaurant though. Should try ordering from the menu it might be better.
0,I had heard so much about this place that I wanted to try it out. It was sooooo crowded and you had to fight to get a table. Everything tasted great going down but it wasn't very filling and it did bad things to my stomach. Let's just say I tried it.
0,"After nearly six years of eating here, today was a shocking experience.  I ordered papya salad, and it tasted OFF.  Too fishy, not enough zing.  I sent it back after a few bites, declining for another plate.  Much to my surprise, THEY MADE ME PAY FOR IT.  That's the last of my dollars you will ever receive!  Didn't even TELL me.  Just dropped the check and said sorry the owner says you have to pay becuase you didn't get anything else.  What?  I was afraid to order more after receiving what appeared to be turned shrimp?  So I have to pay for your food I didn't eat?"
1,"The most delectible thai food on the planet. That is an understatement.... They have great fried eggrolls, yellow curry, and thai BBQ."
0,The sushi here is fine but nothing special. I placed an order for pick up. I had looked up the menu on two different websites. I ordered three roles to share with my husband and it was suppose to total $20. When I got there it was $28. When I told them that the prices online were different they just said they changed the menu recently. I asked if they had a menu I could take with me they said no. I don't think we will be back. There are better sushi places for the same price.
1,"House Seats is one of the most amazing things to happen to me! Last year alone I went to more than 200 shows off of the account. This number includes some of the strip's biggest shows, as well as smaller (but great) shows. It is well worth the investment- you will get your money back within one or two shows. \n\nSign up with this link until 11/9/14 and you can get 2 years for the price of 1! \nhttp://lv.houseseats.com/join/?referer=lisa_crockett@comcast.net"
1,"4 stars for the location, the high food quality, and the large menu selection.\nHowever, in my opinion they need to work on the service which could be better. Ok that it's just breakfast, but the customer always needs to feel welcome. \n\nAnyway, I had a biscuits and gravy plate with eggs, bacon, and potatoes. And a large cappuccino. Simply delicious."
1,"Be aware for negative reviews, these are not regulars and have had one bad experience and then gripe about it. How sad!\nI've been here a handful of times and every time it's great. The service is good, the food tastes great, and they are accommodating. The chicken and waffles is delicious :). My fav!"
0,"I have been coming here every Friday to happy hour and listen to  the live band. They always have the tables outside reserved and the place is empty??? WTF? Went there for Cinco de Mayo and paid $5 for cover, went to the outside tables, which were empty and reserved for 2 hours later and we could not sit there? Pissed me off and left and got our money back. Not going back again. What a joke..."
0,"Had the fish and chips and the Aussie meat pie and a few tap beers.\nFish was shaped (frozen?) and very bland (and 16 bucks!), chips were pretty good. the meat pie was OK, but the mashed potatoes were horrible and the gravy was gelatinous (from a can?) .  We will not be back."
0,"This place is a disaster. Every experience is like a horror movie. The staff are limited English speaking which isn't typically an issue, but when you have to point to each ingredient because they have no idea what you have said (four times) then it is time to do some employee development.  The food is always fresh, but this business will never last as long as customer service is this terrible.  As a side, being a person who speaks Spanish, it is not polite to cuss in Spanish and assume no one can understand you!  Completely rude!"
1,"Everything on the lunch buffet was great. The dosa (Indian crepes that are stuffed) are VERY delicious! A person can get full on nothing but the vegetarian options,  there are plenty of meat dishes too.  Leave room for desert. Very friendly staff.  Parking near the capital is a little hit or miss but that is how it is everywhere downtown."
1,I was really pleased with Bombay Spice..it's definitely not your typical Indian restaurant setting.. Think more contemporary American decor... I mean The Smiths were playing on the stereo which gave it a nice relaxing casual vibe. We were served by a great friendly waitress who really knew the food and explained everything real well.. You can tell she was very excited about it. We started with the appetizer sampler which had four selections of appetizers of your choosing..all were outstanding especially the wings and the chickpea ceviche.  I then tried the Chicken Tikka Masala which had lots of great flavor and a nice kick then we checked in on Yelp and got a free dessert. Great prices and the way you order the food makes it really simple.. Great little casual place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall near PV mall.
1,So my boyfriend and I enter and the hostess takes us to a table because there are no booths but it was too cold for me and my bf so she said where ever we would like I sat by the sun for warmth but then I saw a booth became open we moved. In the bathroom its very nice it was messy and very cold also the mechanism sensor of the water flow didn't work very well and the machine where you have to manually take the napkins out. Didn't work so I came out asking for napkins of course they were very apologetic we sat at a booth with Tammie when she came over there were no menus nor was the table clean because we have moved but they quickly set it up . Tammie was amazing had a great smile always and tried to upgrade us but in a casual way where I didn't feel pressure we asked her opinion on dessert and she gave it to us.she asked us for refills and was very on top of her service. Definitely would come back for the service we love TGIF and it's a routine for us .My bf and I have never been to this one and we will be coming back. the only downfall...the bathrooms:( boo
0,Cox has the worst customer service ever! I have been a customer for over 20 years and I just got a bill for a $100 more than last month's bill. Apparently some of my discounts have expired but they offered me a $5/month discount for being a loyal customer...lol!! I am going to start looking into new service providers. I have never met anyone who actually likes Cox as a provider. I would rather give birth to twins while have three root canal's than have to deal with their customer service department. How is it possible after all these years they do not find a specialist to try and teach their staff to provide good customer service. Absolutely the worst company!
0,"For buying used clothes, this is an ok place with decent prices. I actually think it's a little overpriced for used stuff, but I've never purchased anything from here.\n\nHowever, I have sold clothes here over the years, and it seems like they are getting super picky and stingy about what they are choosing to buy now. Plus, the percentage you get back is very little ( I believe it's 35% of what they'll sell it for). I've brought in some really cute, unworn clothes to this store on my last two or three visits, but they denied everything. Sometimes I don't understand why because I've seen some hideous stuff here before. I guess it just depends on the buyer you get. \n\nThey do tend to take more designer labels, but you'll never get your money's worth by selling them here. I tried to sell my Guess pumps here, and they were in perfect condition and only worn once. Guess how much they offered me for them? $5.80 -_-.\n\nI don't think I'll be coming back here anymore, but I will recommend this place to anyone who wants clean out their closets or to anyone who likes to go thrift shopping. I'd only go with selling cheaper, trendy stuff like Forever 21 and Urban Outfitter brands. I wouldn't recommend anyone to sell their designer items here because you'll just get ripped off."
0,"Be patient.  Massive store with muppets working the register.\n\n3rd week stopping in, 3rd week dealing with incompetence on the registers.\n\nThis is a huge store and you could stock up on every grocery and household good you could imagine.  You could also eat in their restaurant, at their hotbar, salad bar, deli, etc.  They have decent prices on a few things and on Wednesday you save 15% in their \""health market\"".  The health market is the tiny section, all the way to the right.  I'll come back because they have a few things I can't get at some other stores but it won't be my go to store, mostly because I have yet to have an easy, positive experience checking out?  Dumb luck or is it a pattern?"
0,"Stayed here  on 4/7 prior to a business meeting.  It had many of the usual Marriott niceties but no Starbucks or availability of coffee that was any better than Folgers or Yuban.  Maybe it's a Wisconsin thing but I thought that nearly every Marriott had reliable, dark roasted coffee.  The room was OK except that they put me in a second floor room that had windows which started at about 5 feet above the floor and the only view was of air conditioning/heating units and I am a lifetime Platinum.  I am not sure if the desk clerk felt it made little difference or what but this is not a crown jewel by any means.  I understand that this place was a Holiday Inn previously but usually hotels converted to the Marriott brand are better than this one was."
0,The food is ok. Not bad for a buffet. The staff is pretty unfriendly. I felt like I don't belong here. \nDefinitely not coming back.
1,"one of the few hipstery/yuppy places in tempe!  call what you want, it's damn good.\n\ni've never been disappointed in the food here. the quality of the food and the atmosphere is extremely high for the price.  and it's a healthier alternative to other nearby eateries.  the Mediterranean burrito thingy is HUGE and tasty.  it makes two meals for me.\n\nplaces like this in SF charge about double for the same food...\n\ngood for a date (dont get caught checking out the waitresses), group of friends, or the fam (just not the little ones)."
0,"When I signed my lease they told me they recommend having the apt. sprayed for pests EVERY MONTH. The manger admits they have a roach problem and the pest control man told me as soon as it warms up the \""water bugs\"" meaning big roaches will show up. There is a pigeon infestation that is so bad when the wind comes up, there are feathers flying all over outside - it looks like you are inside a room full of birds. They poop on my stairs, entry way, live on my roof, near my air conditioning unit, feathers come in from the dryer vent. The pigeons sit in the dumpsters so when you put a bag of garbage in the dumpster, they fly up and get agressive and dustr and mites go all over the place. I get bit from bird mites when I go to get my mail. Have to wear long pants, socks and shoes to not get bit. My kitchen sink drains out in front of my apartment out into the parking area so there is always a stream of water there. I can see soap suds under the front of my building. Kitchen is a mess. Dishwasher opens across the two sinks, try putting dishes in when you have to move away from the sink, the refig is old and lopsided so the door won't stay open. Cupbards are so small I have to turn my dishes sideways to get them in. No linen closet, stacked washer & dryer with NO place to put laundry stuff. I contacted the manger because I have a bug infestation, which I showed the bugs to the police and they told me to contact the management and have pest control come out and find out what they are. Manager will not respond, I made second request in person in the office, still no response, now the management doesn't speak to me. My guess is several people got bird mites from the pigeon infestation so they are ignoring finding out if the bugs are bird mites. I lost my clothing and belongings due to it, am moving in 11 more days. Yes the view of the golf course is pretty, but the old men in the golf carts go right up to your bedroom and livingroom windows. You have NO privacy at all.I can hear my neighbors do laundry, shower. I fell sorry for the lady below me because I have to do so much laundry due to the bug infestation."
1,"Had an amazing meal! We were seated right away, however, it was a Sunday night and it was 5:30pm. I ordered the trout, it was fantastic! My friends had the meatloaf, steak and ribs. All had great reviews. The desserts were equally as fabulous! Service was great. Only complaint, it was too dark in the restaurant. I will go back!"
0,"Last December after quiting my job I quickly needed something to pay the bills.  After having trouble on my own I decided to test my luck with a temp agency and let them do all the selling for me.  I went into their office to have a sit down with one of the reps, which consisted of me telling my rep what kind of job I would like and the wage I was willing to work for.  I then spent over an hour  taking tests to figure out my customer service capabilities.   After I finished my tests there at their office I was instructed to go home where they would be emailing me links to take more tests of my knowledge of programs such as Outlook, Excel, and Word.  That took about another hour.  So now I have spend 2hrs taking tests for these people they are sure to find me a job right?!  WRONG...  Days went by, weeks even started going by, thank god I had a holiday job..I did get some offers but nothing that was worth working for. Correct me if I'm wrong I did tell you the wage I was looking for when I spent an hour at your office did I not?!?! I gave up hope on Apple One and found the job I am at right now and going strong.  Apparently they don't update their system that often and have recently started emailing me about job possibilities again.  \n\nI gave Apple One 1 star because they didn't help me at all.  Instead they wasted my time which I'm sure I returned the favor and wasted their time!  They did help me a bit though by getting my butt into gear and doing shit on my own!"
0,Was on a itison voucher and felt like I was treated as though I was on a voucher and not like a customer:\n\nSome what neglected...\nNot great value for money...\nGreat atmosphere though...
1,"awesome vermicelli with coconut milk. if i lived around here i would eat at tram's every day. actually, i live in san francisco, which (obviously) has excellent restaurants, many of them vietnamese. i would put tram's up against any of them, any day of the week."
0,"The food quality and selection here is not bad for a buffet, especially considering the price. The major problem is cleanliness and sanitation. My most recent visit was on a busy Sunday afternoon. The dining room tables and floors were simply filthy, and one of the sinks in the men's room was filled with vomit (no kidding).  While the staff was good at restocking the buffet with fresh, hot stuff, they seemed totally unconcerned about the mess in the dining area and bathroom.  The food quality and selection is 3star for a buffet, especially considering the sushi selection, but because of the nastiness of the place I cant see giving more than a 2star rating overall."
0,Been here twice for brow wax. First time lisa did them and they were great! She understood exactly how I wanted them and I was so pleased.  I returned month later and lisa was busy at that time so another female I cannot remember her name did them. I told her how I wanted. I wanted exactly how lisa did it ehich was lining my natural point on the brow and when she was done I was upset. She moved the point to the center of brow.. now when I raise my brows it looks awful.  5 stars for Lisa. Nobe for the other person.  Unfortunately I moved across town so I will not be able to return to lisa. Brow was about $10
0,"The most dissatisfying experience I've ever had in Vegas. I came to celebrate my 22nd birthday with my best friend. We were confirmed for the guest list, but we were promptly held up by the ID checkers, who claimed that we looked nothing like our photo IDs. They proceeded to ignore our offers to show our credit cards matching our IDs, and called a bouncer over. They gave our perfectly legitimate IDs to the bouncer, who also looked them over, then glared at us and shoved our IDs to us, saying \""don't ever come back here using these again\"". Needless to say, my friend and I were upset. We attempted to talk to someone in charge, but they all looked away uncomfortably and said that whatever the bouncer says, goes - unless we happened to be carrying our passports. Neither of us have EVER had this happen to us before, so of course we were not carrying our passports with us. The manner in which the staff treated us (completely legal customers) tonight was atrocious and offensive. The fact that they rudely dismissed us as if we were guilty was infuriating, as we had done absolutely nothing wrong."
1,"Great food, great price, fast service, clean place... I'll be back for sure."
0,"Went there last night for my first time and food was not that great, I have had better filet mignon. But that is not the reason why I am writing this review. We arrived and the hostess had asked my date to remove his hat which I could understand being a nice restaurant and all. After we had completed our dinner and waiting for the check to come, we see a large group seated and most of them were wearing hats, and t-shirts. Now, I am not one to complain about the food or service but if I am paying good $$$$ to eat at this so called nice place, I would accept the same rules apply to all customers. I had expressed my dissatisfaction to our lovely waitress but the manager came by and said sorry like it was no big deal. Regardless of why we were treated differently, If I am going to fork up $200 to eat at a nice restaurant I expect respect, great service and great food. I can say, I will never dine at Donovan's ever again and would give Hillstone my business. Way better service at Hillstone and better food."
1,"Definitely a great place to get a burger.  I live the little bacon burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, BBQ sauce. This testament to the power of the burger gods is only $6! Love this place.  Daym Daym DAYM"
0,Not even worth the one star. Ordered eggplant parm.  Got spaghetti with some eggplant on top.  Terrible and will not go back.  This cost 16 dollars.  Salad was also bad.  Get a real business.
1,"Just a short 15 minutes door-to-door to the strip, this has been by far my greatest living experience in Las Vegas. \n\nA true gated community, well manicured lawns, maintenance that answers calls within minutes, you really experience an elevated lifestyle here. \n\nThe office staff are friendly (especially Brent who has been more than helpful since signing my lease), pool is amazing on the weekends with cabanas and plenty of room for all of your friends. Also, can we talk about the 2-story floor plans? Amazing. \n\nThe complex itself is very quiet, very clean, and VERY convenient. Minutes from Target, Town Square, Raising Canes (heaven), and Glaziers (the best grocery store ever.) \n\nWhile the prices here are nowhere near other complexes around, it's obvious that your dollar here really gets you the best. I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for a spectacular place to live."
1,first time having italian beef.  This was pretty fantastic.
1,"Friday night, ordered for pick up. Food is always amazing. But the serivce seems to be getting BETTER. The bartender offered me a drink while I waited for my order to be picked up. They gave me EXTRA ranch, where most places charge you, and just overall friendly and professional. Garlic knots are my favorite. I ate them the next day for lunch AND dinner! Mmmmph! Pizza is terrific and the menu includes a lot of other dishes I am eager to try!"
1,"I assume that people from Wisconsin are into small town bars and might not be use to clubs; but cover charges, dress codes and lines at the bar are pretty normal things to expect when going out at night.\n\nI don't really understand people leaving low reviews for cheap cover charges that weed out people you probably don't want to be around. \n\nI think this is a pretty normal gay club and I always have a fun time when visiting Madison and coming here.  People in Wisconsin are really friendly and easy to talk to so I always meet some really cool people and have made a lot of friends.  \n\nThe dance floor is a little too laser beamy for my liking but I still enjoy dancing here.  The lounge seating in the front is nice if you want to be in a quieter space and talk with friends and the outside smoking patio seems to be the easiest place to mingle with new people."
0,"Just back from the worst lunch experience I have ever had.  My husband has a \""NO CHILIS\"" policy and I need to follow that.  \n\nArrived and were seated immediately by being asked to take a booth in the bar area. Plenty of available tables but none the less, was asked to sit there.  We were greeted by a nice enough server and she explained the new MiniPad system.  We immediately ordered strawberry lemonade and iced tea.  (2 of us)\n\nWhen the drinks arrived, we ordered from the menu.  My lunch partner had the steak fajitas and I thought to try something new on the menu, Chipotle Shrimp Bowl  The photo looked wonderful.\n\n40 minutes later... yes, FORTY MINUTES LATER...and after seven other tables seated AFTER US by at least 10 minutes were served, our food arrived.  I was famished.  \n\nFirst bite of my bowl was a piece of chipotle shrimp and lettuce and the food was COLD.  Odd, I thought this was grilled shrimp.  So, I bit into another one and yep, cold.  So I broke open one and it was raw.  Yep.  Raw shrimp.\n\nI called the manager over who seemed amazed the food was cold and didn't really respond that it took 40 minutes to arrive and offered me a bowl of soup.  (its 110 degrees outside today.)\n\nNo thank you.  Just the check please.  After 10 minutes, we received a to go order we placed 30 minutes prior and now the server had a huge attitude with us.  I guess being angry at waiting so long and getting raw shrimp served to us is no reason to be upset in her world.\n\nI left a 1.00 tip and we left.  \n\nI will not go back here and I urge anybody reading this... find someplace else to go."
0,I have been a paid member there for since about the time they opened.  There 22.00 wash will cheat you and it won't do the tire shine or other options.  Every time you complain they say it does that from time to time or you get someone else's wash on accident.  We'll enough of the bs.  They are full of crap at cheat you out of the wash
0,"I really like this place, today is my second time here and used the free WiFi for first time and by the way is really fast.  The only thing that I didn't like was that after I order a coffee, tasted and didn't like it, went to get something else and they charge me again.  They have there way to do business but as a retail manager that I am, I think that was wrong.  The minimum I would have done it was offer a discount on my next drink or a discount card for my next visit.   I really like the place but next time I'll order water and won't take my chances to try something new."
1,"My husband and I typically go to Nova's Bakery once a weekend.  For a change of pace, I suggested that we try Sunflour.\nNot a lot of charm in this strip mall shop.  However, we were greeted with smiles and gentle dispositions.  I love the sign that says, \""unattended children will be given espresso and a free puppy.\""  But, this did not stop the running and screaming of two chaps as their adoring grandparents looked on.\nWe got the cheddar cheese biscuits.  Yummmmm-eee!  My husband claims to be a scone tasting expert and loves the dense texture of Nova's, so he tried a chocolate chip scone from Sunflour.  The consistency was more like a sweet biscuit from one of the fast food joints.\nI ordered a decaf coffee and was pleasantly surprised to get a latte.  I don't know if it was caffeinated or not, but it was so good that I wasn't complaining.\nThis place had tables and chairs on the sidewalk so that we could escape the espresso filled, runner-screamer children.  I hope that their grandparents read this review and get a hint!\nNice change of pace from our usual haunt."
1,"The food was execellent, love the shrimp scampi and the bizookie! The portions are big. Customer service was excellent i will definately be back!"

1,Love this place!!! The service is great and the food is delicious!! I have yet to try something I do not like.
1,Really fresh and yummy. Will go back if I'm ever in the area!
1,"If you're looking for the best swimming pool in Las Vegas, The Beach at Mandalay Bay doesn't disappoint. It's the main reason why I booked my stay here this time around. \n\nPools are open from 9am-5pm (seasonally) and gets crowded fast. So make sure you get there a little before 9am (some lined up at 8am..) to ensure the best (beach chair) spot.\n\nThe room showed a bit of wear and our two queen beds weren't comfortable due to the lack of support. Aging must have taken quite a toll since my last visit. Checking-in was friendly even at midnight, and housekeeping is quick to bring up whatever you've requested."
0,"I came here because I had a vegas rewards comp for a free drink. The value was up to $12 and my drink was $14.50.  They comped my husband's $6.50 beer instead....cheap!\n\nSo was the drink worth $14.50? It was a cherry limeade and horrible!  I had my sister try it and she agreed...terrible. I took it outside onto the casino floor, asked for a vodka cranberry and added that to my drink and it was salvageable."
0,"Pizza it's always good.  However this place really needs an update or refurbishment on booths.\n  And they had music playing overhead that was more annoying than anything; lots of static.\nMusic, static and kids tv noise doesn't work!\n\nLast but not least.  Guy that took my order had Attitude Attitude Attitude."
1,"We had a GREAT time with Andrew (our host/promoter) on the VIP UNLTD club crawl! There was a group of 5 of us (3 guys, 2 girls) and this was my first club crawl experience. What a solid introduction! \n\nWe snagged a deal for this crawl from Yipits and we couldn't pass it up. The price was too good!\n\nMy group showed up at around 10:15 pm at the Evening Call at Mandalay Bay for check in, but right before that Andrew texted me, asking if we were on our way, and he was willing to wait for us since we were running a little late. Upon arrival he was really friendly and funny as HELL! Definitely provided us with laughs and good conversation the whole night. He also provided us with several rounds of shots between stops. Pretty dope. \n\nThe venues were NICE! We hit up Light, Mix, and the Foundation Room, which are all inside Mandalay Bay. The final stop was LAX inside Luxor. They were all nice and super fun, especially FR and LAX because they had a nice mix of EDM as well as radio songs/hip- hop. Overall we were satisfied though. We never waited in line more than maybe 3-5 mins and everything went smoothly. Each stop was roughly an hour. \n\nI'd totally do a crawl with Andrew and VIP UNLTD again! I look forward to another in depth discussion about hip hop with him, haha! Good times!"
0,"One of the worst dining experiences I have had in Las Vegas in recent memory.  We walked in and no one greeted us at the door.  Finally a gentleman who had walked by us before asked if we were looking for a table.  Finally we were seated.  We were taken to a table where there was a wine bucket with an empty bottle of wine next to it, which was moved away.  We sat down and the server proceeded to tell us about the items that were not available.  It was still early on a Friday and they were out of many high cost items including steak and clams.  We decided to order a glass of wine to start.  It seemed as if they were short staffed.  So everything took a very long time.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine and an order of bruschetta.  The server returned later with a bottle of wine and informed my husband that they were out of the wine he ordered as well and would he like to have a glass from the bottle she brought over.  Finally,  we got our bar order.  We had been seated for a while.  No bread came.  Then finally about 15 minutes later we were brought a mediocre loaf of white bread. (nothing special).  I went to use my bread plate but it was dirty, it looked clean but felt like it had a dirty film over it.  The bruschetta was finally delivered and it was nothing to get excited over.  The bread was not toasted and it was just chopped tomatoes and garlic on untoasted bread. \n  In the meantime there was a musician who was playing in the dining room.  He sang Billy Joel, Cat Stevens songs kind of your typical lounge songs.  I enjoyed listening to him.  It seemed as if most of the people there were coming to listen to his performance.  A party of 3 people came in to listen to him but 5 more joined them and they needed a bigger table.  They wanted to put 2 tables together but the waitress kept saying that someone would move their tables for them.  Finally, the manager? came over and moved the two tables for them inches away from our table.  We were literally an inch away from 2 people at the table yet there was plenty of room that they could have moved them to the other direction.   At this point my husband picked up our table and moved it out of the way.  No one really seemed to care or notice that we had moved ourselves. \nAt this point we decided to cut our losses and leave.  No service, no food, no clue!  We went in looking for a casual dinner out and left angry and frustrated.  Don't waste your money!"
1,"CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN and they usually have AC.. yesss!! This free tram is an awesome perk if you are staying at Monte Carlo (which is where I have lately been staying at). It is great also during the hot and lazy summer days. The tram usually is not too crowded and you are able to fit in there comfortably. It makes stops at Aria and Monte Carlo to City Center/Crystals/Aria, all the way down to Bellagio/Vdara making it convenient and efficient to get from casino to casino.\n\nIt will sadly not take you all the way across the strip but it is nice to not have to walk all the way down. (There is other trams that also connect to other casinos such as Excalibur, Luxor and Mandaly as well as the Mirage and Treasure Island tram) It came in handy too the one time that it rained in Vegas when we were there. I do wish though that it would come around more often. Usually comes around ever 3-6 minutes but the waiting area has had plenty of shade and its clean.\n\n#140/2014"
1,"We went here for dim sum on our way out of Vegas, thanks to the suggestion of lovely Yelper Jacquie C. There was quite a long wait on a Sunday afternoon, unless you were willing to sit in the smoking section (we weren't). When we finally got seated, we were impressed with the elegance of the table - nice, laquered wood and rolls on the benches for reclining. We were immediately brought fresh tea, and they never let the teapot get anywhere close to empty. We could have ordered off the menu, but we chose dim sum. Every single piece of dim sum was amazingly delicious and very high quality. We especially liked the chef's special that day, which was a steamed dumpling with abalone and crushed peanuts. Our big complaint was that the dim sum carts did not come by often enough. Understandable given that most people in the restaurant were eating off the menu, but we were very hungry and got very frustrated waiting for the carts. The frustration factor would have lowered this rating to 3 stars, but having recently had some very boring and uninspired dim sum recently at another place back home (the food was lacking, not the company!), I was reminded of how delicious the food was here in comparison. Except for the dim sum carts, the service was attentive. The price was not as cheap as what we'd pay back home, but hey, this is Vegas, plus we were a small group, which makes the dim sum cost go up when you split it up per person. Overall, great food, though the experience was lacking since we were so tired and hungry."
1,"Nicky's used to be my little secret.  But with a creative menu and a stunning garden, Nicky's has really taken off.  It's a little harder to get a table there now, so it's smart to make a reservation these days.  \n\nI have had many wonderful meals here, the food is very good.  I particularly like the mango dishes, the scallops, the spring rolls and the curries.  Excellent Thai food in a beautiful setting.  I recommend that you eat outside, the garden is stunning."
1,"Not as good as the one in New York. The menu is extremely basic, with no extraordinary options. We elected to go with the a la carte menu, since the tasting menu seemed especially uninteresting. \n\nFor my first course, I had the onion soup, based on a recommendation from our waiter (blanking on his name). It was delicious, even though it was the most expensive soup I've ever had. No complaints there. 9/10.\n\nFor my second course, I had the gorgonzola crusted filet, and that was good. I use the word 'good' intentionally because although I enjoyed it, it wasn't memorable in any way. 7/5/10.\n\nWe elected to skip dessert because of how uninteresting the options looked. Service was excellent throughout the night, and everyone was very nice. I enjoyed the night, but for the money, I just expected more of a 'wow factor.'"
1,"Yum!  They have huge rolls that are just delectable.  A bit pricey and I wasn't as impressed with the non-sushi entrees.  However, the sushi is awesome!\n\nI would recommend getting an appetizer and just jumping straight into the sushi heaven."
0,"I'm asian, so that make me a automatic expert on korean food.\n\nThe interior of this restaurant needs a renovation badly. Service is good, but the food is average. Not worth eating out. I order the korean rib...it was average...I believe they pan fried it...ribs are bbq not pan fried...."
0,"Once again, an issue. This time I went to kiosk t o purchase ticket, kiosk malfunctioned and said for me to see an agent at counter, I went to counter and explained my situation and,  Shauna (spelling?) Started showing a co worker pictures o cupcakes while I stood there, AFTER I EXPLAINED I NEEDED ASSISTANCE, then when I asked her by she felt the. Need to show picture a,while I needed assistant w she threw a fit and handed me a complaint form then stomped into her office like a 2 year old who didn't get a cupcake, she unprofessional and rude#!  greyhound has been a huge disappointment my last 2 trips, from now on I will just rent a car, I don't feel safe on greyhound, the employees have provided more negative then positive experiences."
1,"Aesthetically, the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful and boasts a romantic view of the strip.  It offers al fresco dining and has a private room that can host parties.  It has such a romantic ambiance that is perfect for date night.\n\nThe service was great and very attentive.  My glass of water was never empty and there never felt like a long gap between visits from our server Amy.\n\nThe bread in a bag they give you was delicious.  It was warm and soft and I had to stop myself from filling up on that to save room for dinner. I like that they pour olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette into a plate as a dipping sauce for you.\n\nI ordered the mahi mahi special.  It came with giant sea scallops, mahi mahi topped with crab, jasmine rice (although our server had said risotto), and asparagus.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  There was a miso demi glaze on the scallops, but I couldn't find the miso flavor.  It tasted just a bit more like sweet and sour sauce to me.  The flavor profile was a tad on the bland side for my taste, but nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't fix.  Overall, my food was good.\n\nJust a few notes.  The outside patio overlooks the parking lot as well as the gorgeous view of the strip.  It's unfortunate the parking lot is there, but that view over sunset and at night is beautiful.  The patio is also on a slight decline.  Our table and items placed on the table slanted just a bit.  It's nothing terrible, but it's noticeable.  And lastly, they don't give you prices for the specials.  If you're budget conscious, ensure to ask.  The mahi mahi special set me back $32 whereas most of their dinner items were $16-25ish.\n\nOverall, the food was more like 3.5 stars (my date had the pesto gnocchi which was very one note in flavor and gummy because it was overcooked,  a disappointment, but my food was pretty good), service was 4 stars, and the restaurant itself and atmosphere are 5 stars. So it all evens out to a 4 star rating."
1,"I had the best breakfast ever at Lo-Lo's. My husband heard about this place from one of his friends and we just had to check it out while we were in Phoenix from Virginia for a wedding. We are so glad we did, the food is A-m-a-z-i-n-g and the service is just as wonderful!  The waffles were some of the best I have ever had at a restaurant and the chicken was done just right! Yum! :) I wish we had better places like this in our area. We hope to eat here again next time we are in Phoenix! :)"
0,"I must say... I was really looking forward to having dinner here. We were on a quick weekend get away in Scottsdale for my 32nd birthday, and I booked this place to celebrate with the love of my life. \n\nBoy oh boy, what a disappointment !!! We arrived, and I was impressed with the atmosphere, decor, and the fantastic view stretching across the phoenix urban sprawl. When we checked in with reception, we were informed that we would have a 10mn wait to be seated outside.\n\n\""10mn ? Not a problem !\"", I said, and continued on to state that we would grab a drink at the bar and sit outside to take a look at the view, while we waited to be seated in the dining area.\n\nAnd we waited. And waited. And waited. All the time, seeing free seats being taken by others (although there was no one waiting behind us). We ended up asking about it, and they were quite rude, did not apologize, and ended up telling us that they had been looking for us, but we were no where to be found, which is IMHO a load of bullocks, given that we had made eye contact with the floor manager several times during our wait. In the end, we got seated by the bus table, still outside, my mood souring by the minute... but hey, it was my birthday, I wasn't going to let something like that ruin the moment.\n\nI wasn't surprised by the prices, as I knew what we were getting into. I was however, surprised by the crappy quality of the dinner we had for the $ we paid. \n\nThey brought the perfunctory \""amuse gueule\"", which was a joke, to be honest. If I was a restaurant manager, I would be literally embarrassed by what they deigned to serve: 2 table spoons of some sort of artichoke bisque served in a large mug... makes you feel like someone scraped the bottom of a soup pan and was serving you yesterday's leftovers from the local penitentiary. I was quite unimpressed. Gordon Ramsey would have had a fit.\n\nAt this point, we were also annoyed with the high powered, halogenic lights, that are pointed right in your face, literally blinding you when the beams catch you at the right angle... I was starting to have a head ache, as was my wife.\n\nThey then came around to serve us some bread and pesto butter, which I must say was pretty nice tasting.... (but come on,... how hard is it to screw up bread??).\n\nWe perused the wine menu, and decided to order a South African white chardonnay, from the Stellen Bosch region (Mirlest white)... which was pretty good. Nice touch was that we didn't finish the bottle, and they re-corked and bagged it for us before leaving... which was a plus...\n\nAs a starter, I had the pan seared foie gras... which was a bit too gelatinous for my liking (have had way better)... the waffles were a nice touch. It reminds me of a restaurant in Paris that used to serve foie gras with ginger bread... quite nice... the sweet and salty combo always works wonders.\n\nMy wife ordered the Chevre walnut tarte... one piece of advice... stay the hell away from it. Its mainly a medley of thick, sandy crust and walnut powder,  with ABSOLUTELY NO DETECTABLE trace amounts of goat cheese.... For 11$, it was an absolute rip off. The server initially didn't react when we told him that this dish was absolutely not a success... however, he did later take it off the bill.\n\nMy wife just had a really unlucky evening. Being vegetarian, she ordered the Vegetarian Trilogy.  What this ended up being was a soggy vegetable lasagna, served with a supposed macademia truffle sauce that tasted more like peanut butter, except that it was even more bland and greasy.... The truffle scented gnoccis that we ordered as a side dish, looked like, and tasted like stale, soggy, greasy fries... yuck.\n\nI however ordered the diver's scallops and lobster, which was pretty good. Not the softest lobster, but damn tasty, and the scallops were perfect, and huuuge. \n\nNo dessert, as we were pretty disgusted with the whole experience.\n\nNet/net: expensive place, crap value for money, food is totally hit and miss, but the view is nice, if they can deign paying attention to the service they provide...."
1,"A great stop here in Madison. This is clearly a locals favorite. If your looking for a good diner with lots if food and good service, this is your spot. The decor is simple and reminds you of \""middle America\"". The waitress was very friendly and accommodating to our slightly complicated ordering. It is cash only so be sure to stop by an ATM if need be. Overall, great experience."
0,"On a Sunday morning, things got rolling slowly here... took a while to get basic attention, water, staff seemed frantic and recovering from a Saturday night perhaps.  \n\nNo egg substitutes here... \""we stick strictly to the menu\"" we were told, so if it says poached and you want scrambled, or egg-whites, too damn bad.\nHad the crispy spinach and portobello which was good, then learned that the spinach is deep-fried which I wish I'd known before I ordered.\n\nNot kid-friendly so you'll get the staff fish-eye if you've got little ones along.\n\nOverall the food seemed over-priced and the quaint atmosphere only goes so far.  Hop over to Marigold's down the block for the real deal."
1,"Very romantic atmosphere.  Service was excellent. Food was good, and the view was gorgeous. Definitely recommend for date night. Try their homemade gingerale."
0,The pizzas here are ok.  The quality of the pizzas didn't meet my expectations of a Wolfgang Puck restaurant.  The service wasn't so great either.  There were two managers walking around like mobsters. I've even caught them messing around off to the side. I just didn't get the feel of an upscale pizzeria here.  I've had way better pizzas. The complimentary bread basket was yummier than the pizzas:(
0,"My husband and I will never order from this place again! They delivered our food to the wrong apartment; didn't bother to verify the credit card from the imposter (the credit card has a female name on it and the imposter was a man that signed for the CC receipt). The make matters worse, CT's owner (who was the driver that screwed up the delivery came back with another staff from the restaurant) when they arrived, they didn't bring replacement food, didn't apologize nor offer us a comp! The whole time I was on the phone, complaining to the CT's staff, he was lying to me by alleging that the owner remembers me and my apartment and has delivered to us before. I then said to him, IF he remembers my apt, then why would he deliver the take-out to the wrong apartment?! When those 2 idiots came back to my apartment complex, they still couldn't find our bldg. (even after I asked them \""do you know what my bldg. number is,\"" in which he replied \""yeah yeah, we know.\"" My husband went downstairs and ran into our security patrol and told him the whole incident and the patrol told my husband that the CT people had been circling around and around our apartment complex for awhile and the security patrol had to go and retrieve them for us!"
1,"This place is in the Luxor on the second floor.  When we got there the hostess was very friendly, since our whole party hadn't arrived she said we could be seated or wait at the bar.  We decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited.  The bar tender gave us a menu and then proceeded to the  other end of the bar.....where he stood till someone in our group finally walked over to call him.  He was to busy laughing and hanging out with the guys at the other end and totally forgot about us. \n\nAfter we finally got him to come take our order, I had the carnitas and black beans it was really good.\n\nThe whole time while we ate they had some really good music playing."
1,"I heard a legend that a man once spent all of his 72 hours in Vegas at The Double Down. Didn't check into a hotel. Caught a few hours of sleep on the janky couch. DIdn't want to leave. Didn't need to leave. In a city full of attractions and decadence, The Double Down held his undivided attention for 72 straight hours. That is amazing, and this bar is amazing."
0,I waited 31/2 hours for my tires to be changed. I was tild it would take half that time. No one came to tell me it would be longer or why. When I mentioned how long it had been they didnt acknowledge it was an inconvenience.  The waiting room was not busy so I dont know why they dint communicate wih me.
1,"Awesome things about Mon Aimee:\n\na. Kind, knowledgeable, attentive staff.\n\nb. Excellent variety of chocolates from throughout the US as well as tons of international options. (two favorites: Poco Dolce from San Francisco and Eclipse from San Diego)\n\nc. New products appear frequently (exciting for a regular visitor)\n\nd. As other reviewers have enthusiastically mentioned, CAPOGIRO GELATO, dark chocolate flavor. Seriously, the best I've found in the US (...and by that I mean darkest chocolate. It's always too light elsewhere!). We're really lucky they distribute it in Pittsburgh. \n\nMy only caveat would be that for items you can find in the grocery store, such as Chocolove bars, you're better off grabbing them at Whole Foods, Giant Eagle, or Right by Nature - you may save about a buck per bar."
0,"Me and my gf just got done eating here.  Everything on the menu sounded great and we decided on the chicken Benny and she decided on the sirloin sandwich daily special.  My plate had plenty of food on it, but when I took the first bite it was unfortunately fairly cool, not warm at all. As I got to the center if the plate it did get a little warmer but it just wasn't as hot as I like.  My gfs sandwich was very big but she told me it was very bland tasting.  I tried it and she was right it didn't have a delicious taste.  I't wasn't bad but for a 15 dollar sandwich and fries I think it could have been better.  We have been wanting to eat here because we had coupons, but guess what they said that they couldn't accept the coupon because it was a holiday.  Halloween,  I guess I should have known better considering on the back it says not redeemable on holidays.  Come on who ever thought that halloween would fit into that category.  Well I was wrong!  So 32.00 dollars later I did have leftovers but that's about it.  I don't know if we will be back, maybe one more try later.  Oh forgot to mention that the server only came to us about 2 times and never offered to refill our drinks.  Also she didn't offer a straw for our drinks.  Now that I think about it the only reason why I'll be back is to use the coupon once and for all and to try the snickers pancakes!  Happy halloween."
0,"Today at legacy urgent care I was appalled by the behavior of the front seat lady. She was rude to me and my mother. My mom called to pay my deductible, she slammed the phone down on her and she cursed under her breathe. Her name is Elizabeth. I have never been treated so horribly here, but she has always been a little rude, today just went too far."
0,Our waiter is delusional! Bad service! He filled up my drink and forgot who it belonged to in less than a minute and gave my drink to the table next to mine! Food is bland! Never coming back! What a gimmick of a place!
0,"I love Dunkin but keep driving until you hit the next franchise. Poor customer service. Then I twisted my foot near the counter with the straws because the floor drain was missing a cover. I asked the employee if he knew the drain was open and his response was- \""it's fine.\"" Nice."
1,Amazing! Five stars for sure. Could be a cafe in Paris. The staff is French so it feels authentic and they know the regulars. Super friendly even if it's your first time in. Tried the Nutella crepes - awesome. Tried to pear and chocolate crepes - awesome. Tried the Lorraine quiche and it was delicious and moist. This may be the best brunch spot in Scottsdale.
0,"Mediocre, too much sugar, not enough protein (though you can pay extra for chicken) and not a great value for the money. But I still enjoy it once in awhile for reasons I can't even explain."
0,"This location is always out of most donuts when we visit.  We have walked away empty handed in my last three visits as they are out of everything that my wife and I might want.  They do not make donuts at this location, they apparently truck them in from Mesa.  If they are going to truck them in, they either need to deliver enough to last the day, or send the truck back with more; apparently no one cares.  They need to get their act together soon, or they will end up like all of the previous incarnations of KK in the valley.  This location only gets two stars because the donuts are good when they actually have them."
0,"I came here with my daughter on May 7th 2014 and then again on May 21st 2014. On the 21st, I was waiting for my daughter to be finished with her nail drying and as I was waiting, I noticed their inspection review posted on the wall. I began reading it and every technician was red flagged. Every single one. The inspector had so much to write about he/she wrote all the faults and flags in between preprinted words, around the outsides of the page, and on the back. For each tech under the comment field, he/she had to write so small about all their short-comings that it was very difficult to read. From what I gathered, it was mostly how each tech wasnt cleaning their tools properly, unsanitary, bacteria found.  The date for the inspection was May 8th 2014. The one line that stuck with me was \""not a single bottle of disinfectant/tsa or liners throughout the entire salon nor at any nail stations\"". When I was finished reading, I turned around and found that management the receptionist and a few other techs were watching me. I asked when their next inspection will be, and they said \""no need, we passed\"". I said, \""according to this, clearly not\"". I got a shrug of the shoulder and a back to my face. When I paid, I didnt offer a tip, and the receptionist asked me if I was going too, I informed her that I shouldnt be paying for anything,  but because I didnt come in here to get something for free nor an infection or worse HEP C, I certainly wont be giving a tip. Needless to say, I wont be going back. IMHO."
0,"This place is very overrated. The hamburgers and sides are way overpriced. Sure,  the fried egg option is awesome but the burgers do not taste that great. I went to lunch here with a friend and between the two of us it was $28+ dollars. Way too much money for a fast food  hamburger stand. For that price, I could eat at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar. The service here sucks too, I was gambling around 4AM and went up to the counter. The guy cooking did not even acknowledge me.  So I just left. There are way better hamburger places than this dump!\n\nLast great hamburger stand my A$$!!!!!!!!!!! --Very disappointed"
0,"My gel manicure started peeling off in big chunks after a week.  I read all these good reviews so I was really expecting a great manicure, but I wasn't impressed."
1,"Four stars is pretty good in my book, and I've seldom given 5 stars.\n\nI've ordered the curry squash dishes and noodle dishes in the past. On a recent visit, I ordered the egg rolls (they are fairly large), the stuffed chicken wings with brocolli and peanut satay coconut sauce, and bean thread Long Song (sp?) dishes.  \n\nI have tried the Atwood and Willy St locations and I really do adore the charm and personalized attention one gets at the Willy St location more. I think we were served by the owner/co-owner and she was extremely attentive during a busy Saturday night.\n\nThe food was delish, and we had enough leftovers of course, for another meal. \n\nOne thing I would recommend to them is to have more noodle dishes, and few people know what \""bean thread\"" noodles are, so it would be good to use other descriptors like \""clear rice noodles\"", etc. \n\nAlso, at other places, when I've ordered stuffed Hmong chicken wings, the sauce accompaniment has been fish sauce with lime juice, so this was a variation upon that classic."
1,"Listen: I'm just going to cut to the chase. If heaven had a bakery, I'm pretty confident it would be La Gourmandine.\n\nI've been dying to come here for ages now, and I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner. When I walked in, I was greeted immediately and everyone was very friendly. It felt just the way a bakery should feel: quaint, homey, and it smelled wonderful.\n\nI was immediately skeptical when I entered the bakery, however, because the girl behind the counter was really skinny and pretty. I typically don't trust bakeries with skinny employees. But not to worry, this place is legit, I promise. Obviously, everything looked amazing so I asked the girl there for some recommendations. She basically recommended everything and then said, \""Oh, how could I forget about the cream puff!\"" I pretty much so wanted to ask if she wanted to be best friends on the spot, but instead replied, \""Yeah, I'll take one of those, too.\""\n\nI left the bakery with 5 huge pastries because I obviously couldn't decide on just two. I apologize to my already non-existent waistline. I was trying to get things for my better half and I to enjoy together this weekend, but he's still at work and I can make no promises that there will be any left by the time he makes it home.\n\nAs I was checking out, my new BFF said, \""Oh, you should come back here earlier in the day, we have twice the selection!\"" I'm literally glad I didn't come earlier in the day, or I probably would have left with 10 pastries. But tomorrow morning? Well, maybe I'll go back tomorrow morning."
1,I think the problem here is management. Enough said.
0,"I went to eat here a few times.  The first time, I forgot what I ordered.  The second time i ordered pasta which was decent.  The third time i ordered the mushroom burger and it was disgusting.  They had the mushroom and the meat blended together."
1,We use ABD for our business cards and brochure services.  We have been very pleased with both their attentiveness and turn around time.  I would recommend them to other business with similar needs.
0,"An hour my foot!  I have. Even waiting almost 3 hours and my glasses aren't ready.  Next time it's  Walmart!  I'll pay less, and at least my glasses will be ready when they tell me. At the 4 hour mark they were still telling me another hour.  I was so mad I left.   The price of One  hour service is built into the cost of the glasses, that is what you are paying for.  If you don't get this within  reasonable amount of time you should get a discount.  After this I am no longer a customer of LensCrafters!"
1,"Excellent menu range, very flavorful meals, free chips and salsa appetizers, gigantic portions, and prices in the $10-15 range typical of a Mexican restaurant combine to make Laredo's the best Mexican place I've yet tried in Madison.  My only complaints are the flavor of their lime margaritas (which is sub-par) and the lack of kick in their salsa (but I love very hot foods)."
0,food sucks...me and a friend order a blt....very salty bacon and they use cabbage instead of lettace....its call a BLT....wtf...there is no cabbage in BLT....\n\nService was average.....food sucks...my other friend had the rotisserie chicken...he was disappointed...\n\nThe food is very expensive for a cafe...I don't recommend....
0,"I might be able to give this place another try.  Key word MIGHT.\n\nBut to pay $25 to have to squeeze through sweaty, gross, pervy picture taking, dudes that looked like Rick James, chicks wearing clothes way too small for them, beer spilling drunk assholes, isn't worth my time.  Ok, so we only paid $10 each thanks to some finagling with the clubs host, but $10 was too much for what i had to experience and endure inside.  Key word FINAGLE\n\nWeaving through people, trying to get to a destination where we could see burlesque dancers we get up to the front bar by the stage and AMATEUR HOUR is going on on stage, and no where else to go.  Not burlesque dancers...just really drunk girls who probably shouldn't have been dancing.  (This is not an attack on our friends who after half of us left proceeded to dance on stage....I'm sure you totally belonged there and were hotter than everyone else up there.  honest).  It is always entertaining to belt out Living on a Prayer, or to bring it back to the old school and do the Tootsie Roll or Ride the Train, but that wasn't what i signed up for.  I wanted talent in small clothes.  Key word TALENT.\n\nNow i might give this another try if i were to find out when the the burlesque show were to actually start.  Amateurs dancing with beaded curtains in fuzzy bedroom slippers, a burlesque show doesn't make. Key words ITS SUPPOSED TO BE A FRICKIN BURLESQUE SHOW!!!!!"
1,Best pizza ever! It's so fresh. You don't feel bad at all eating the whole pizza! :) the cheese is amazingly delicious. The sauce is not salty and In fact you can taste the fresh tomato perfectly. Another great thing is that everyone is so so nice and you feel so welcome there:) a MUST go ! Pizza and gelato: fantastico!!
1,"I rarely send food back to the kitchen to be cooked more and I've never had to send food back twice... until tonight.\n\nSo why 4 stars? We'll get to that.\n\nWhen my wife and I first arrived, the place was pretty well packed. Yes, there were tables open, but the greeters were out of menus and had to wait for some to make their way back to the front desk before we could be seated. The greet staff appeared overwhelmed. When we were seated, the person who guided us to our seat (Jason?) didn't really seem to care much about what he was doing.\n\nWe had to wait for a bit for a server to show up, but Amy got our drink order and our appetizer order quickly once she made it to our table. The loaded potato skins appetizer was quite good.\n\nWe put in our dinner order and got our salads shortly after the appetizer arrived. And this is where things started falling apart. My wife's green salad was fine, but my Caesar salad wasn't as green as it should have been. The iceberg lettuce was turning brown.\n\nNot that we had a lot of time to consider our salads since the entrees arrived very quickly. We both had steaks and baked potatoes. The potatoes were big and fluffy and quite well baked.\n\nThe steaks on the other hand... PJ ordered hers medium and I ordered mine medium well. They were both medium rare at best. Hers actually looked rare. We flagged down Amy who was surprised the steaks had shown up so quickly and so obviously undercooked. She apologized and took the steaks back to be cooked more.\n\nChris, the manager, soon showed up to apologize for the inconvenience and to thank us for our patience. I mentioned the brown lettuce to him and he took the offending salad away. He offered to bring something in place of the salad, but I declined.\n\nThe steaks came back and this time... they were maybe medium rare. Maybe. I told Amy the kitchen was making the restaurant look bad. She once again apologized profusely, seemed genuinely upset on our behalf, and took both steaks to Chris. He came by and this time started out by saying he was embarrassed. We mentioned that we'd been at the restaurant in the past and had very good experiences before, but it seemed like this was a really \""off\"" night for them.\n\nHe agreed that something had gone off the rails and graciously comped our meals.\n\nThe steaks arrived again, but not the same ones. They cooked new steaks for us and this time they were just right. Amy stuck around to be sure as we cut into the middle of both our steaks to check them. They were flavored perfectly, cooked perfectly, and we ended up having a nice meal.\n\nChris gets points for dealing with us both times things went wrong and for crouching down to our eye level for the second apology and taking responsibility for the mistakes. Completely comping the meals was an unexpected and welcomed gesture. He also went out of his way to make sure we understood that Amy wasn't to blame (we knew that, but it was nice to see a manager have his employee's back like that).\n\nAmy gets points for showing her concern for our satisfaction and for being just as baffled as we were over the obvious poor quality of the preparation of the steaks. Meat shouldn't be red on steaks done medium or above, and the first two were red through and through.\n\nBoth of them thanked us for our understanding and for not losing our cool (yes, PJ has mellowed me that much over the years). We got Amy to laugh a bit and she got us to laugh as well by asking if she could get us an \""undercooked dessert\"" with a perfect deadpan expression. She earned her 20%+ (before the comp) tip.\n\nSo, even though we had an adventure of poorly timed food service, confused employees, and undercooked food, Amy and Chris went out of their way to make things right, and whoever cooked the new steaks for us showed us what we knew the kitchen was capable of doing. They screwed up, but they took responsibility and handled the situation quickly and professionally. That's why they get 4 stars for what could have been a 2 star performance or worse."
0,"Explosive vomit and diarrhea!\n\nReally wanted to like this hotel as it is a favorite of my parents.  Not sure how it got a 4 diamond review with worn carpet, tired room decorations (and we were in one of the 'upgraded' pool view rooms) - and one of the best - pay $10 for the pod coffee in your room.....Skip the $25 VIP check in too.  On the phone, we were told it included not waiting in line to check in or the buffet and access to the spa for basic things like the sauna - but upon arrival, that was not the case.  Front desk and check in people both on the phone and in person seem to be a bit flippant - not at all the customer service you usually receive at a '4 diamond' location.\n\nWe had been together as a group of 8 people eating at all sorts of restaurants on the strip - then down to 4, having stayed downtown at Bally's and then our last 3 nights at Golden Nugget.  We all ate together at the buffet - nothing fancy but great service and great selection of food based on the price - also had a really great meal at the Italian restaurant inside of the Golden Nugget.  On Tuesday night, my girlfriend and I ate at Lilly's the Asian restaurant and had fantastic service and great food.  On Wednesday night, when we returned and got our vegetable rolls and Pad Thai to go, it was also great at 10:30 pm, but at 2:30am, that's when the trouble started.  My girlfriend was hit first with vomiting and diarrhea then it hit me 30 minutes later.  Lots of fun with only 1 bathroom.  I thought we were going to die - and this went on for hours.  When I could finally pick up the phone and report this to the front desk, I let them know what was happening, because we certainly wouldn't want anyone else to go through this.  I asked if someone could send up ice, water and 7 up which I thought might help with the constant and non-stop vomiting and diarrhea.  They acted like we were drunk or hung over (I think we each had a beer that day) which I'm sure they get a lot - but explosive vomit and diarrhea.  About 40 minutes later, room service showed up with a $38 charge for 3 small bottles of water and 7up in a carafe watered down with ice.  I signed the slip in desperation for some relief and thought we would deal with it later.  \n\nFront desk had told us we would need to do an incident report, but the thought of looking or talking to anyone was too much until  finally by Thursday night, we thought we could keep it together long enough to have security up in the room to do the report.  He apologized profusely and was wonderful, and when we told him about the room service charge, he said that was definitely something that should not have happened.  He said he would turn in the report and because it was the weekend, we probably wouldn't hear from anyone until Monday.\n\nMonday, Tuesday - finally on Wednesday we called and here is the response we received from Richard Smith, claiming to be the manger of risk management of all Golden Nuggets.\n\nBy the way, we were only asking to have the room charge reversed.  As a courtesy, they should also have reversed at least one of the room nights.  Nothing doing  - without proof - just our word against his.  We calmly mentioned we owned a restaurant and knew the importance of safe food handling and that given the rapid onset of these symptoms and that NO ONE ELSE in our group had these symptoms, it was from something that was contaminated, cross contaminated and / or someone didn't wash their hands.  Without a doctor's report, nothing he could do.  I mentioned we were basically trapped in our room and couldn't leave, we missed two shows we had paid for on Thursday  night, and reversing room service charge seemed like a reasonable request as did reversing one room night.  Nope.  Not without a fecal sample.  So while I am finally feeling back to usual as of yesterday - nearly 7 complete days later - my girlfriend is still not feeling well.  I asked if I could speak with someone else as I really could not believe this was his stance and he said no - he was it.   He actually said that we should have gotten the water, ice and 7up ourselves, which I replied we had thought was a really bad idea since we couldn't stop the bodily fluids from coming out both ends and thought that would be bad going up and down the hallways.   I calmly told him I would definitely be escalating this and writing on line reviews warning others about this horrific customer service and I was told to be careful, they take liable very seriously......."
1,"What's not to like about Beach Hut Deli? Cool beach theme decoration, nice spacious interior and outdoor area, cold beer, delicious food, and large portions. Am I a fan?HELL YEAH!!\n\nYou can call them a \""chain\"" which is why I usually passed on the lunch invites, but I probably wouldn't now. If you did though think of a Subway or Quiznos but on steroids. I ordered The Pig Kahuna, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beach-hut-deli-las-vegas?select=rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg#rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg they should call it the Big Kahuna at least that's what I called it when I placed my order.  A pile of pulled pork covered in a sweet, kind of mild BBQ sauce, melted cheddar cheese, and chunks of pineapple in a French roll.  I had the hardest time picking up The Pig Kahuna and taking a bite that I started to use a fork and knife to attack it.  It was delicious and put a smile on my face. They have other healthier sandwiches and other dishes which seemed big also.\n\nThey also have daily happy hour specials which run from 3 pm to 6 pm. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beach-hut-deli-las-vegas?select=rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg#_G9o8Wiph6vpLOdvXc0u2g and the happiest hour 3 pm to 4 pm for $1 pints.  Did I mention that they have a lot of TV? Great place to watch a sporting event."
1,"Loved it. Good prices good food, love the variety of Mexican cheeses, tortillas  and sweet breads."
0,"I really hate giving bad reviews, but the seafood was terrible here.  You could tell we were eating old shrimp. The salmon was also old and had a super strong, fish odor.  Cost was too expensive. We paid $50 for two dinners one pop and one margarita.  The salsa was just ok.  The only thing that was good was the margarita, but I went there for seafood. Very disappointing."
0,"I went here for their new customer cleaning discount. I made the appointment last week. I showed up 15 minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested. The front doors were locked, no one visible in the office, no response to knocking, no closed sign or \""Back at [clock]...\"". After pounding on the door in the rain for several minutes before calling the office's phone. A person who claimed to work for a 'sister practice' answered, confirmed my appointment, and put me on hold while he tried to get ahold of someone in the office. After several minutes in the rain, he told me that he could only reach an answering machine. I left.\n\nI have never been so grossly disrespected by what's purported to be a business. I have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism. This business and medical practice does not give a fig about its patients'/customers' time. Judging by the other reviews here, I clearly dodged a bullet."
1,Health nut is perfect to start the day
1,Great first time experience! Awesome customer service and they are all very helpful and friendly! And cheap!
1,One of my favorite date spots!  The inside is hip and cozy.  The ramen is cheap and filling.  One of my top recommendations for folks who are looking for something a little bit off the beaten trail.
0,"Probably one of the worst Chipotle locations that I have visited.  It's crammed in a small ass hole in the wall beneath a McDonald's on the Vegas strip.  It's combined with a Panda express or some other fast food Chinese food joint.  We stopped in for a lunch on a Thursday afternoon.  We were one of the lucky ones to actually find a table.  The food didn't taste as fresh as it could have been either.  There are a boat load of choices for cheap grub on the strip, I should have followed my gut and skipped out on Chipotle.  You've been warned!"
0,"The food is actually great and we were really looking forward to having the bacon board on the 4th of July, but we sat and sat at the bar while the bartender tended to his glasses. It wasn't busy and it was around 12:30pm and we couldn't understand why he couldn't ask us if we needed anything or even acknowledge our existence. We decided to leave and were quite shocked with the poor service. Won't go back to that one, but will to the one on Shea. At least there they are nice and say hello!"
0,"So I remember 12 years ago walking into the Willow House and being stunned at how cool I was for being at such a cool place. We drank coffee, listened to some guitar playing hippy and drank our lattes as we smoked our cloves. I was at the top of game as a freshman in high school. \n\nFast forward to today, the place is still basically the same. Cool teenagers will be in awe of how cool they really are just being there. But in reality the coffee is just ok, the food barely edible, and the people mostly annoying. If you want real coffee and a much better atmosphere, find somewhere else, Phoenix has so much more to offer."
0,"This used to be a great place to grab lunch. I wish they would bring back the mango salsa. Went today and felt dirty being in the restaurant, there was so much dirt on the ac intakes and the ceiling tiles were stained from leaks and you could see where liquid had actually ran down the walls. The management here needs to put the cleaning gloves on and their glasses apparently. The food was not memorable and not worth the money."
1,"Oh my!  We had the thin crust and wings. Wings were crispy but not overcooked, with sauce on the side. Pizza was cut in squares and excellent!  Needed just a little salt, but that's just me.  He didn't use salt at all. Atmosphere could use a little help. Don't know if this is just how they do it in Chicago or it was just bad.  Bright and loud with too many tvs. Food was good enough to go back for tho. Good place for kids and sports fans. Loved it."
1,I went with my girlfriend for lunch.   She ordered the guacamole burger which I tried some of.   It was one the best burgers that I've had In a while.   I ordered the cajun chicken pasta.   I've had this several times and it's one my favorite dishes.   Add on a fat tire draft beer and you are all set.   \n\nGood food and good service we will definitely be back.
1,I've rented cars through this location many times.  \n\nPros:  Staff are easy to work with and always pleasant.  Cars are usually available when they say they will be.  They pick me up!  Easy to extend rental time with a phone call.  Prices are reasonable.  Better to get a ride here instead of picking up car at airport.\n\nCons:  Service could be better during peak seasons but staff are really doing their best with what they have available.  Pick up service could be a little more timely or they should make a phone call to let the person know they are going to be late.  I've waited over an hour to be picked up.  \n\nI keep going back.
0,"After viewing the mostly positive information presented on this site, we thought we would check out this restaurant for a taste of Cuba.  Sadly, we were greatly disappointed in almost every aspect of our dining experience.\n\nThe waitress pretty much ignored us when we arrived, and seemed indifferent to us over most of our meal.  They no longer have a buffet, and we were also not able to order the Cuban Sandwich on the day we went (though the waitress never explained why).\n\nAlthough the food we ordered was tasty, the meat dishes were a bit tough.  I'd rate the food itself no higher than 3 stars over all in quality, and the price was very steep for what we received.\n\nPoor service, high prices, and mediocre food...it was very disappointing, and we won't be back again."
0,"Let me start by saying I love kids.  What I DO NOT love is little kids staring at me while I change into my bathing suit in the women's locker room.  USE THE FAMILY LOCKER ROOM people.  Is nude women changing really what you want your young children to see?\n\nAnd here is another prime example of what's wrong with Las Vegas parenting...  Instead of teaching your kids to follow the rules you let them sit in the hot tub despite being way under the 12 year old age limit.  Set a good example for your kids folks...  And Lifetime staff, please if you see this happening, ask them to get out."
0,"If you like eating straight up sugar then this is the ice cream for you. I had rum raisin and I could not taste the rum nor the raisin. Just the thought of how sweet the ice cream was makes my teeth hurt. Ice cream, pizza and fries are usually good even when it's bad. Not so with this ice cream. Yuck yuck yuck.\n\nIf you like eating straight up butter then this is  the cupcake for you. I think whoever made the frosting forgot to put sugar in the buttercream. It looked so promising but it really lacked flavor. The cake part though was moist and flavorful.\n\nIf you like eating butter dipped in sugar- can I be your friend?"
1,"Huge patio, beautiful shopping center, ALL NC BRICK, attached to Harris Teeter"
1,Went back for round 2 and again Sunny was awesome and friendly.
1,"Thursday night Karaoke.....Excellent night, good crowd, reasonable drinks/offers and open until 3am...Really good atmosphere and having read some of the previous reviews, have found the venue well run on both the Thursday's I have been along to.\n\nIf you're a Karaoke fan, then this is one night worth popping along to."
0,"Got a comp because everyone in our party got food poisoning, came back to redeem it and the dark lady at the counter wouldn't redeem it nor call the manager. Wouldn't let my dog eat here. Don't take chances, you'll get sick and they'll treatyou like crap."
1,"By far my favorite grocery store is sprouts.\nI come to this location almost on a daily basis.\nThe staff are friendly, courteous and knowledgable.\nThey have a great selection of produce including many organic choices.\nTheir meat and deli department is pretty well stocked and they will package anything as you like it.\nThey stock tons of gluten free items and have an awesome bulk section with the likes of nuts, grains, chocolates, dried fruit, granola, etc.\nThey also have a pretty good vitamin section.\nHead on over for some healthy food at great prices. I find that prices for produce at sprouts are consistently better than any other store and the produce is better!"
0,"I don't know if I could ever recommend this show to anyone but the most hardcore Beatles followers.\n\nI have seen Ka, O, Ovo, Todem and Kooza. Love is the toned-down version of their usual amazing acrobatic Cirque du Soleil type shows. They have more of a dance-song routine. Half the time I don't know where to look. There is so much going on (someone coming in with a smoky umbrella from the right, while someone is doing some gymnastic move in the air up top, all the while the stage is moving and changing with each song). The whole night, I was expecting more of their spectacular acrobatics but it definitely fell flat for me."
1,"With over a dozen sauces to choose from for your chicken wings....the problem is what to choose?  The waitress was very accomodating and gave us samples of many of the sauces.  An added BONUS to this particular restaurant is the 24/7 hours of operation.  Although I may never be there in the wee hours of the morning, it is nice to know when I am in the area, there is an awesome place for buffalo wings.  We ordered 18 wings with Medium, Asian Zing, Caribbean Jerk, and Parmesan Garlic assortment of sauces.  Also my friend also ordered the \""Buffalito Tacos\"" with her choice of any sauce, but she chose the standard BBQ sauce.  Granted we both ordered water for our drinks, the cost of everything including tip was below $25 for two....NOT BAD!  If you are fan of buffalo wings like I am.....you will enjoy Buffalo Wild Wings whichever restaurant you choose.  I can't wait to go again!\n\n(Sidenote:  I  found out from the waitress that Buffalo Wild Wings is a large franchise chain that still has to creep into the Orange County area.  Until then, the Chino Hills or Rancho Cucamonga area will have to do.  But for this review, I reviewed the Montecito-North Las Vegas restaurant.)"
0,"Yuck Yuck Yuck. I went to Sumo with my best friend and her mom, and had the oddest experience. First off, the sushi was really awful. The appetizers were good, especially the garlic edamame. Now, I think the rest of our mistakes can be attributed to a large language barrier between us and our server, but we got the wrong saki, wrong drinks, just a lot of \""wrong.\"" Apparently it's under new ownership but the best part of the meal was easily the Kirin Light."
1,My family loves to come here for family fun days. It is newly remodeled and with lots of TVs with sports and cartoons. Every time we go it is very clean. The atmosphere is very friendly and the pizza is good too. They have tons of new games and they were all in working order.

0,"Never trust a 'high-class' restaurant that doesn't  know what it is serving.  I saw Chinese, Japanese and Thai food on this menu. the prices were also 10x regular dim sum fare.  I mean obviously, Las Vegas is not Monterrey Park, but give me a break.  The next time I want authentic Asian food, I will go off strip! If I am lazy, tired, hungover,or my baller mom is paying, I will go here.\n\nPROS:  \n- sea bass\n- pretty crystal glasses\n- attentive service\n- all the water you could drink\n\nCONS:\n- chewy, large grain brown rice (maybe this is just expensive rice)\n- seems like crazy prices for dim sum\n- average sushi\n\n\nThe drunken noodle was def NOT \""the best I ever ate\"".  It was pretty unmemorable!  Giada obviously doesn't know what she is talking about.  PSSHHHH, Food Network!"
0,"They should change the name to Streets of Bejing because their pizza, wings, and sandwiches are about as far from New York as anything I've ever experienced!\n\nEven the worst New York pizza is better than what this place is serving up.\nThe wings tasted like they were dipped in vinegar.  No flavor.\nI've eaten at this location several times, each time thinking how maybe I just got a bad dish, or they were off their game that day. Not the case. \n\nGood thing for the owners how most people in Arizona who enjoy S.O.N.Y. have never tasted real New York Pizza and wings, otherwise they'd have been out of business long ago.\nI will never grace their doorstep again, even if they were giving it away!"
0,"Probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  This outdated cafe is located in New Orleans hotel.  We came here because they're known for their $3 steak and eggs dish, four years ago...  Price went up to $6.  This is still affordable, but the food quality was just out of this world... far from being consumable.  Most people at my table got spam and eggs or steak and eggs.  I got sausage and eggs.  I passed my sausage around and everyone at the table agreed that I have the best dish and loved my sausage. lol  The spams were really salty!  There was only one server who served 10 tables and 5 hostesses to greet and seat people.... Overall, avoid this hotel.  It's filled with old and weird people and food isn't all that great to attract anyone's attention."
1,"Originally, we weren't planning to go here, but as we kept on passing it by from other places to our hotel, I yelped it see what their rating was. It surprised the hell out of me to find out they averaged 4.5 stars. Now, me and Kathy are huge BBQ fans and wanted to balance out our weekend with a meat splurge. We decided dinner was going to be how it was going down...\n\nAgain, the stoopid Google Maps app fails us again and has us feeling our way to Bobby Q. We finally get there and got sat down immediately. We got served a basket of cornbread that looked like hockey pucks. There was a crunchy texture on the outside, while the inside was moist and fluffy. It was spectacular, but don't fill up on them, unless you are on a diet and weren't ordering anything else. I'm usually skeptical of ordering brisket, unless I know there was some Texas affiliation. Lots of the Yelpers raved about the brisket and when the waitress recommended it, it was a no brainer. What was difficult was what else to order.\n\nWe settled on the the Whole Hog Heaven, after much debate between me and Kathy and interrogation of the waitress. The Whole Hog Heaven is their best feast where you can choose 2 BBQ meats and 2 pit ribs types, plus 3 sides. We went with brisket, smoked sausage for the meats and St Louis ribs and Texas beef ribs. For the sides, we ordered the mac n cheese, roasted corn and shoestring fries.\n\nFirst off the bat, the brisket was as good as advertised by Yelpers (thanks, y'all) and our waitress. Juicy, moist and tender with a smoke crust gives the brisket an unforgettable experience. Another winner was the St. Louis ribs. It literally fell off the bone and was oh so tender. The sausage was good, but not outstanding and the beef rib was also just acceptable. Against the waitress' suggestion for their \""smoasted\"" chicken, I do think I will try the smoked roasted chicken and the baby backs next time. All of the sides were tasty, but the stars were the brisket and St. Louis ribs.\n\nTo top off a grand BBQ evening, we were given a brown paper sack of mini donuts that were sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. That's a nice touch. Overall, I give Bobby Q a solid 4 stars on the basis of the brisket. You can have a brisket sandwich and die happily, and yes, its that good! The service was good and the food came out fast. \n\nI can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu. There was a couple next to me,  who ordered enough for a small army. The guy raved about how the Southern Fried Chicken was the best he had ever had. The dude looked like a food heavyweight, so he must have had a few country fried chicken in his lifetime, so I'm adding that to the list.\n\nUntil next time, BBQ compadres..."
1,"The staff was great, from the owner Bruce meeting you at the door to the bartender Sharon the friendliness of the staff stuck out. \n\nI had the T.T. Burger which had cheddar, sauteed onions and remoulade. The burger was excellent, and the coleslaw was great. I am not a slaw fan, but this slaw with Bruce's mom recipe  that included vinaigrette was wonderful. My only complaint may have been the fries were slightly overcooked for my taste, but I would go there again."
0,"I'm with Caesar, avoid this place like the plague.  Jack isn't a nice guy, he isn't dependable and he will lie straight to your face.\n\nBrought my car in because the check engine light was on and we had been told we needed to replace the timing belt.  They were the most resonably priced (what a joke that phrase turned out to be) and could have it back to us a few days.\n\nNow the nightmare began. \n\nAfter over $1,400 dollars in repairs, I picked up my car and drove home.  The following morning, same problems with the car - misfiring and the check engine light was back on.  Back to the shop we go.  Now we have new problems!  $500 later, more repairs.  The next day, car was misfiring and you guessed it, check engine light back on.\n\nBack to the shop we go!  More work (that they didn't charge us for, but I don't believe was really done) and they PROMISE the car is better than new.  \n\nRiiiiight....\n\n10 miles down the road, car is misfiring again and the check engine light is back on.  And where did we go the next morning?  Back to the shop - but this time Jack, the owner, was there.  And what an unplesant, rude, disrespectful man he is.  I cannot believe he owns a business.  He flat out lied to my face when he told me that \""Chuck\"" had drained my gas tank and found it full of gunk.  Funny, I had the same amount of gas when I dropped it off and no one had mentioned that had been done.\n\n2 days later, now we are being told the computer is fried - another $2k worth of work.  What?!?  Oh, and today Jack emptied the tank.  Interesting, as Jack told me it had been done 2 days before.  And when he did?  He \""forgot\"" to fill it back up, leaving me with fumes to make it to the gas station.\n\nThe car is now at the dealership, which is where I should have taken it to begin with.  Not trust some shady, rude, liar.  \n\nI wouldn't take a Barbie car to this \""repair\"" shop.  Hopefully they won't be in business much longer and won't be ripping off other people."
0,This is an update on the deli .... Dear deli you suck your help is incompetent and slow I have passed up shopping in your deli because of the help you hire
0,"Hard to find the entrance.\n\nI hate the \""Bottles and Burgers by Double Helix\"" name.  First off, when I hear bottles and burgers i think beer and beef and buns, not wine and beef and buns.  They have wine pairings for the friggin french fries for crying out loud?  Please.  Stop.  \n\nI know that the 16 dollar burger joints are all the rage, but stop with the wine pairings and upscalifying of it.  If you're gonna charge that much for a burger and then $4.50 for an order of fries they better be badass.  My burger was overcooked and underseasoned  and underwhelming.  Not bad, but small and overly precious.\n\nI also hate when joints like this serve their food on a fancy plate to make it look fancy.  They have these fry server things with a sauce receptacle that makes an order of fries 18 inches tall and all fancy-looking.  Problem is there's only 20 fries and the fancy aioli sucked in spite of the special serving containter.  Fries with champagne and shallots?  No thanks.\n\nSo, the concept is wrong.  The value is not there.  The portion sizes are laughable.  The food is ok at best.  The room is schizophrenic.  Is it a bar, a restaurant, a soda fountain?  The accoustics stunk and the room stunk.\n\nOne last beef.  What's with the \""by Double Helix\"" in the name?  Is that a household name?  Is that a signifier of quality dining?  Is that a trustable brand that everyone recognizes?  Nope.  It's a struggling wine bar for tourists @ a casino that 99 percent of locals don't know about  and a newly opened, lame rehash of a wine bar @ Town Square.  Don't get ahead of yourselves, rich guy restanteurs.  You haven't proven anything yet except that you have enough money to burn to open a few restaurants.\n\nCheck out Shake Shack in New York if you want to see how this idea should be executed."
0,Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in.
1,"Sundays this is one of the spots to check out. Not the best, a bit small compared to other Vegas clubs but it's more than accommodating, still a great dance club. Some nights there is order outside before getting in the escalator to enter the club. Guys in one line and girls on another but other nights the line can get down confusing and yeah a few bouncers need to take the chill pill. Tourists just want to have fun!\n\nBank nightclub is worth checking out, much better if one calls the club/host ahead of time and reserves a table. We received excellent bottle service from the host. The people I went with were impressed by it. A few times I have ended my night here and met some great, funny, interesting people and tourists.\n\nMusic played in this joint is pretty much the same as everywhere else, top 40, hip hop, house music. Oh bring the visa, americanexpress or the wallet with plenty of cash, you might be surprised what you will pay for a cranberry and vodka."
0,"Decent daily HH, but food quality was lower and prices higher than expected. Service was dismal at best. Convenient to my 'hood but can't see myself returning, not sure how they have so many locations unless this was out of the norm for them.\n\nOne waitress for whole place, but only three tables. Still barely saw her and had a mistake on our order. It was fixed and she was polite but not particularly attentive. When not serving she was seated at the bar watching a screen and drinking from a mug, maybe she wasn't feeling well.\n\nMenu describes wings using the word \""giant\"" but I found them quite small- one in the bucket was literally the size of my car key. Medium buffalo sauce was spot-on, regular and curly fries are both tasty. Standard bar fare, really.\nWebsite menu lists a November special of soup and sandwich, but those specials were nowhere to be seen on in-store materials. Luckily they still had it, because the potato soup is actually really, really good!"
0,"I came here with 2 other people, about 2am after playing in the casino for about 4 hours. My sister in law said the had good prices on the \"" late night\"" menu. The cafe was nice, clean and comfy. Our waiter took forever to come over and when he did he wasn't very pleasant. Our order took forever. We all ordered the same thing with one having slight modifications. She asked for turkey bacon and cheese on her scrambled eggs. When our food finally showed up it looked disgusting. Everything was coated in grease, the bacon looked and tasted like it was deep fried and it looked and tasted like the eggs are made from powdered eggs. When my friend pointed out they forgot her cheese the waiter asked her if she wanted him to bring her some cheese out or have the cooks melt it on? Seriously... She sent it back with him but less then a minute later he was back with the cold cheese they sprinkled on top. She said she wasn't going to send it back for a second time because she didn't want anything extra too be in it... \n\nAll in all I've read the reviews and I'm not the only one who thinks this place sucks... I'm from out of town, I come to GVR 3-4 times a year with my family that lives in town. Guess if your drunk you don't complain but you would think someone in marketing at GVR would be vigil at this social media thing and maybe want to fix the problem... Needless to say I'd rather starve then eat here again..."
1,"Wow! Can you say pampered? \n\nBeautifully decorated inside to out. Nine pools that are 24 hours, which makes it a 5 star easily. The only thing that counters the 5 star review that makes me go back between 4 and 5 stars... is... NO WIFI? Apparently some rooms have it, and some don't. But for such a high class place with so many business guests, no wifi? It does seem a little ridiculous. But all the goods outweigh the bad (it's hard to find a 24 hour pool anywhere, let alone 9 24 hour pools). \n\nThe staff here go out of their way to be helpful. Very accommodating, very friendly, very available. Can't really ask for more... and I speak of the concierges and what I believe are managers that wander around helping guests. \n\nI would like to see more knowledgeable bartenders. I guess in such a nice hotel I'd expect a little older/experience bartenders as well as maybe valets. They were all really nice but it didn't really suit the rest of the hotel. But the patio that overlooks the pools is unreal, so nice to have a drink as the sun sets. \n\nThe cactus garden is really cool. Definitely worth taking a stroll through. Convenient parking.  \n\nWe went to the Il Terrazo (sp?) and the staff was really friendly. The food was really good but pricy. \n\nThe rooms are very nice, turndown service is a nice touch. The hotel is stocked with all the things you'd need for a stay - shampoo, conditioner (not the combined all in 1 that I loathe), q-tips, bath wash, body wash, shower caps, face pads, slippers, bath robe, soaps, mini bar (they even have a wine opener!). If you are coming from outside of AZ, bring your own water. The tap water isn't the best. \n\nThe have a bath tub and a nice walk in shower as well so you can bath how you like. The order in movies are a little pricey, they have flat screens but no DVD players. Room service is over priced, with a 22% gratuity automatically added and a $5 or something charge. \n\nThe good thing is it's in Scottsdale, near a lot of awesome places to see in Arizona!"

0,I've eaten here twice waiting for my flight and the food has been awful both times!!  Really bad compared to other Pei Wei's.

1,"We had a wonderful night here on my son's birthday. What made it so special was the great service that we had out of our waiter. Even though we were in a remote far-off corner of his outdoor patio on a chilly evening, he kept his eyes on us and we were never left wanting. [They have great heaters and they aren't afraid to use them.] The atmosphere is not as cool or charming as it could be -- I wish they'd spent a bit more to make the place look good. But, I did like the food, and that's what counts. I had a huge piece of pork tenderloin, and some great Mac 'n Cheese. While nothing is especially unique, their comfort food does just that . . . it gives you the feeling that someone who loves you just cooked you a home-cooked meal. I don't get that feeling in a restaurant very often. The next night we had dinner in another famous Phoenix restaurant (Tarbell's) and it was a let-down compared to this. When the waiter heard me reference my son's birthday, he brought out a large desert item which was enjoyed by all. A great experience! We were there on Arizona Wines night, and enjoyed a great bottle of Cochise Country white wine for half off. I like promotions like that."
1,"Sometimes post offices seem to forget what their main function is and instead you walk in and end up getting side tracked by mountains of candles, stationery, jewellery and other items that you completely forget that all you wanted to do was post a letter.\n\nAs Gavin said, St Mary's Street Post Office is just a post office. All you can do here is post letters and parcels and perhaps buy some stamps. They have a very small selection of Scottish post cards, but that's it."
1,"I went there on a Saturday around three to get some food, this was my first time coming here and friends have told me that it was a nice place so I wanted to try it out.  The atmosphere in there is very nice and modern.  The waitresses were very nice, helpful and gave good recommendations when I told them it was my first time there.  I am a fan of Pad Thai so I got that from there.  It did take longer than expected for it to come, but once i got it I saw that they do give you a lot in the to-go containers.  As others have said the sauce was sweeter than normal, I do like the sweetness though.  I counteracted the sweetness with some hot sauce and it created a nice contrast.  It definitely was a lot of food for what the price was, and me being a vegetarian I appreciated that they could make many of their dishes vegetarian.  \nI liked it definitely, and would recommend it to friends, the only thing I advise is to make sure you have cash on your person they have a $10 minimum to use a credit/debit card."
0,"This Long Wong's was a great dissapointment.  This location opened up not to long ago and my husband and I decided to try it out. Not to mention we are big fans of their wings. First time we went to this long Wongs, it was about 30 minutes before closing the kitchen and they told us they ran out of wings. We went back a different day and ordered wings, the sauce on the wings was terrible as if they sprinkled chilly powder you would put on fruit. The second order of mild wings didn't have sauce at all. It was a disaster. From this point on I am only sticking to the long Wongs on 32nd Street and Thomas, they sure make the best wings."
1,"I live just down the street from Mr. Geero. My family and I decided to give it a try and I am so very glad we did!!! I had the Philly Cheese steak and fries. The sub roll was very soft, the cheese, steak, onions, peppers, and mushrooms were perfectly cooked. Normally I don't rave about French fries cause well, they are just fries but, these were hot, perfectly salted and most importantly crisp!\nMy mom had the Greek salad and she said it was just as good. The lettuce and feta were fresh and the dressing was homemade. My dad had the original gyro and said it was fabulous. All and all not one complaint! The owner came up to speak to us and he was super nice! He gave us some Baklava and invited us back. I have never had baklava that was fresh and this definitely was. It was delicious!!!\nRestaurants in this area have a bad habit of failing. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go and try Mr. Geero!!"
1,"Best Bananas around. Big ,delicious frozen bananas fresh dipped and rolled in nuts! Found at fairs, craft marts and festivals.  \n\nPrices are reasonable and they are fresh dipped in front of you. High Quality chocolate makes this my favorite!"
1,Love this place. Great Eggrolls. Amazing Chicken Noodle Soup. Great Service I'm A Regular now.
1,"Bravo!  Viva Portofino's!\n\nGreat pizza, truly a gem in the Arboretum neighborhood.  The fact that the price is reasonable only makes the value that Portofino's gives you that much better.  Service is great, and the Italian accent coming from behind the counter is like a warm blanket reassuring you that your food will take longer than usual, but will be worth every extra second you have to wait for it.\n\nIt is crowded, be warned!  Don't expect to swing by on a Friday evening for a quick bite.  Such is the price you have to pay when your food is so delish!"
1,"Coming from Boston this was a trip - it was like a Disney world version of the real thing. A Irish pub that I go to in Southie recreated in over the top manor nestled in a picturesque shiny new Chandler downtown. It was even on Boston St. I was like a bazaaro Boston where old plastic surgery cougars and BMX type (I think T.J. Lavin was there) bandanaed bros replaced the usual preppy/ super Irish Southie crowd.\n \nThe decor was decent but almost too much with the $1 written on bills plastered everywhere ( A real Irish pub tradition) and green lights and screens all around. \n \nI was surprised at how good the food was both the traditional Irish fare and the modern updates on bar food classics were all pretty good. People got super wasted - more so then in Btown -  the hot staff was veryforward with pushing booze on us, which was kinda fun. \n\nAll and all not bad - I made me feel like home and a little like my wild days at ASU w/splashes of Scottsdale in the charming new Chandler downtown."
0,"I love conveyor sushi joints, and while this one appears clean and has a friendly staff, there's simply no excuse for serving what should be cold dishes at or above room temperature.  Each plate I tried was as warm or warmer than the previous one, leading me to cut the visit shorter than it would have been out of fear of getting sick.  On top of that, the check topped $50; that money would have gone further and with better quality at Ra or even Teharu.  I definitely won't be returning."
1,"You gotta be hip to be SQUARE.\n\nWhat a cool idea to have their ice cream in a square instead of round.  This is so helpful in so many ways.....\n\na.  The taste - 5 Star - I personally like Mocha chocolate fudge and Coffee in waffle cone. I usually don't order ice cream but when I do, watch out!  There are so many flavors, I cannot tell you all, but the texture is rich and creamy, the taste is awesome, the quality is like Ben and Jerry compared to a generic brand. \n\nb.  Location - 4 star - Near to St. Thomas More on Wigwam and Pecos. usually no parking issues, but no shaded trees to park under.  Boo Hoo when it is over 100.  you come here to cool off and then you heat back up!\n\nc.  Ambiance - 4 star - The place is a long rectangle, which is great for long lines. However it is not inviting at all for sitting and eating inside. Just a bit \""cold\"" or lacking character.\n\nIf you love ice cream and want a treat this  is the place to go!\n\nIF you want an even more unique experience, and want a crepe with your ice cream, drive a few miles south to Crepe Shack and Waffle on Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the KMart Sears area.  This is a great place for Thrifty ice cream in a crepe with fruit.  Totally Yummy."
1,Modern bohemian atmosphere with hearty vegan menu that wont leave you empty. The spicy is not too spicy and the sauces are just right. Great place for good food.
0,"staff was very typical of chinese restaurants, cold and sterile with evident love for their job. all the dim sum tasted the same because most of their dishes were made from shrimp. service was adequate, but the food was embarassing for my guests."
1,"\""I'm goin goin back back to Cali Cali\""...ok, I HAD to do that...moving on...!\n\nThe last thing anyone wants to do is be at the airport on the morning of Christmas Eve, hungover, and with a little less than three hours of sleep. However, Sky Harbor Intl. Airport made my absolutely horrendous morning bearable and then some.\n\nI was expecting long lines when I checked in my bags at Southwest but it was surprisingly fast and efficient. I felt that my things were in good hands. I thought, \""this is too good to be true! Security has to have crazy long lines!\"" Nope,  I was wrong. Security was a breeze. No lines. It all went by quite smoothly and it was nice of them to high-five me and wish me a safe flight. I think they could tell I was hungover and on zero sleep, but nevertheless, it was a sweet gesture.\n\nYou'd think at 8 a.m. there would be millions of people at the airport but it was surprisingly very quiet. Stopped to get some food and a much needed cup of coffee and before I knew it, I was on my way back to the bay. Thank you Sky Harbor for making my trip from AZ back to CA effortless and stress-free!"
0,"First, I want to say I love their chai. They have a great spicy chai. They do offer a (one) gluten-free item for snack. Holley's Cuppa also does have almond milk which is super. \n\nHowever, I do have to agree with some comments about the staff being rather unprofessional. It seems like it is just a place for the staff and their friends to hangout. Everyone else is just in the way. I had to ask for something three time before I could get them to actually hear me. Several times they are not looking at me because they are trying to half pay attention some where else. I believe one of the times this happened resulted in one of our drinks not actually being flavored.\n\nI enjoy fun people but customer service still needs to be there. \n\nI miss the ambience of a good coffee shop. Holley's Cuppa does not have it. It is run down and unkempt inside. It is not a place that you can find a cozy spot to do work or read a book. Sitting on the patio is usually out of the question because the smokers get the run of it.\n\nI really want to like this place too - there is a desperate need for good coffee shops. But Holley's falls a bit short."
1,"Visiting NC from South Florida, which is closer to NY on the culinary map than the Deep South, we were craving some down-home style southern food. FBC did not disappoint! Straight from the airport, my bro-in-law brought us to The Flying Biscuit.  Fried green tomatoes to start with an Espresso Stout (Guinness + espresso shot) on the side, delicious!  Then the Cajun Chicken omelet with a dash of the Texas Pete hot sauce--phenomenal! Biscuit was great (of course) but did not fly well ;)\nFriendly service, fantastic food! Next time we're in Charlotte, we'll be back!"
1,"Good service, very friendly staff. Oysters are delicious. I'd give a 5 star of they had more sauces or garnishing given other than lemon and tobasco sauce. But it's very yummy nonetheless!"
0,"Tried 4 different flatbreads, 3 sushi, lobster linguini, meat balls, 3 different beers, cocktails, and white wine, nothing is good. The only thing that is fine is the chicken flatbread. \nThe server, Darius, is attentive and friendly while others are not.\nWill not come back unless I take my puppy here to enjoy their patio and open air."
1,"This is a spacious, clean and  well organized Nordstrom Rack.  There are many bargains to be had although a lot of the merchandise looks like it is direct to the Rack instead of merchandise that arrived via the Nordstrom stores. \n\nThe entire back portion of the store is shoes and unlike some Racks which only have one shoe out and you have to go and ask a clerk for the mate, this Rack has both shoes out. Some of the discounts were not as deep as I would have liked on the higher end labels, but they were still a bargain."
1,"Over the past 2 weeks I have been a frequent customer at this particular PetSmart!  I have a new puppy in my house and need lots of treats, dog food and toys!  Of course, Howie, is eating the best dog food around BLUE BUFFALO!  No soy, no gluten, and no corn and best of all no meat by products!!!!!  Yes it is pricey but why wouldn't I want Howie to eat healthy food when I eat healthy food, right?  The toy selection is OK, seriously I know a lot of people don't want to spend money on good toys, but really give me options people!!!  As for the collar and leash selection, HELP!  I have a boy dog and I am a girl-options would be great in this department as well.  Think about it, it is his outfit and he should look fabulous everyday with colors that compliment his coat!  The staff has been great and helpful with little training tricks-nice to have dog lovers work at a pet store.  I would NEVER take Howie into PetSmart as it is just a breeding ground for illness.  Geez, you never know what diseases other animals may bring in.  Not everyone vaccinates their animals or takes care of them the proper way.  Though it is nice to shop with your little 4 legger-they are better left home:)"
0,"I stopped in for lunch with some business associates.  It didn't take me long to remember why I stay away from these crappy chains.  Food was okay at best, service was slow, it was loud and uncomfortable, and the prices say that I paid for the \""experience\"".  Meh.... never again."
1,"They took me on a walk in. Great pricing, super friendly staff, and my girl did a nice job. Got a fill and gel polish with hearts for valentines day for $33. Can't complain about that!"
0,Small plastic fork. Let's start there. I had the fish tacos and they were edible only because I was starving. Poor excuse for salsa bar. Service was ok served with a smile at least but all in all food was horrid. At least it is hard to mess up Horchata :) \n\nRivas or Filly B's next time I need a quick Mexican dive fix for lunch or very early AM snack.
1,"I am reviewing specifically the Chicago Hot Dog Cart in this Home Depot. I Love it! \nWho in their right mind does not want to go to a store on a Saturday afternoon shop and then have one of the best Hot Dog's in Madison? \n\nI'm just saying for $3.00 I can have a Chicago style hot dog loaded with all the fixins' including a kosher pickle. It's great.\n\nMy wife gets the chili dog and swears by it. She also has said on multiple occasions at the Home Depot that the chili dog is one of the best in the area. \n\nWho would guess that a small little hot dog stand sitting in the Home Depot was so awesome! \n\nI'm telling you, instead of running out to your car to drive back home and think about doing your weekend warrior projects, take a minute and snag a hot dog at the cart located inside the entrance of Home Depot.\n\nVienna Dogs, true Chicago dog style! Great hot dog!"
0,"We had tickets to the Beatles LOVE and stopped in as it appeared to be a laid back, kid-friendly place in the Mirage.  That being said, I don't think I'd return to this place, even with a great coupon!!  Service absolutely sucked -- the wait person arrives after waiting 10 minutes and says, \""do you want to order?\"" Ummm . . . . well, I wasn't just sitting here for fun, what the heck?!?!  She really never grew a personality from there on, every interaction was more annoying than the one before.  I don't remember ever tipping as bad and I did this person.  I like to believe I am a generous tipper, especially for good service, but this was not one of those experiences.  \n\nI asked about the lamb burger and she replied, \""I'm not the one to ask, I hate lamb\"".  Oh great.  I'll take the turkey burger then.  And it was average, a little hard, but average.  Hubby had the bacon burger and said the same - average, very average.   The kids ordered the chicken strips and lo and behold, LOVED them!  Their milkshakes were good too, devoured in a minute, but I wouldn't go back just for a milkshake and chicken strips.  Afterall, they are a burger place, right? \n\nFor what you get (and I'm not referring to the service), the place is expensive.  Burgers are $12-17 and that does not include fries.  For a good burger, maybe, but that's a lot for an average burger.  Even by Vegas prices!"
1,"Great place to pick up limited edition M&Ms and souvenirs! if you're on the Vegas strip, you gotta check it out!\n\nPros:\n-Four floors of candies and goods\n-Each floor carriers different products \n-(Floor 1 Souvenirs, Floor 2 Candies, Floor 3 Toys and Clothes, Floor 4 Nascar products)\n-Well staffed and maintained\n-Floor 3 has a free, short 3D Showing of \""I Lost my M in Vegas\"" (Good for the kids) \n-Great promotions (different each day EX/ Free lb of M&Ms w/ purchase of candy dispenser)\n-Clean restrooms on Floor 4\n\nCons:\n-Long lines (But each floor has several registers!)"
0,"Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards. \n\nI was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.\n\nI would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.\n\nCheers,\nUntil then, get the beers in...\nJust not at Shogun."
1,"Great dinner.  Went last night, food was great, wine was great, service was excellent and attentive.  Ambiance was perfect for our dinner party of 4.  Everyone enjoyed it."
1,"This place is awesome!\n\nMy roommate, her niece and I came here a few days ago after shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square. \n\nThe ambiance is really cool with funky light fixtures and chairs. \n\nOur service was top notch (Thanks Kyle!) - our waters were never empty and he was very informative about the menu.\n\nWe had the rings, totz and sweet pots plus the 5 various aiolis. My favorite was the spicy aiolis since the main ingredient was sriracha!\n\nFor the main course we had: the buffalo burger, turkey burger, and the chicken burger.\n\nI love that they come in slider sizes because it gives you a variety of choices to pick and choose from so you're not committed to just one burger. \n\nI will definitely be back for more and to get my drink on!\n\nFor a good laugh and pictures, visit my blog at: \nhttp://www.adventuresofahungrylatina.com/2011/07/dont-judge-burger-by-its-size.html"
0,"Flight delayed both ways, with no reason given. Poor customer service. Nickled and dimed for EVERYTHING: $25 for a carry-on bag, $5-$50 extra to actually get a seat with your travelling companion, $3 for an in-flight beverage (I'm talking soda here, not alcohol) etc. etc.  And literally, the most crammed, jam-packed seating arrangement possible for an aircraft: you get about 8 inches between your face and the seat in front of you. You could not PAY me to fly this airline ever again. EVER."
0,"For many years Dillard's was my favorite store. However I have noticed a decided lack of initiative these last few months. Dresses that were identical except for the color were priced differently. Trying to return a dress ( for the first time ever) when I saw it had gone on sale during the last 10 days I was told they didn't have time to change the tag right now and it would have to be put in the back. I was also told Dillard's won't honor the current sales price because they \""don't play games.\""There were 3 saleswomen and me in the whole department yet not one of them could mark the dress down?! If they don't play games why not price the identical dresses with identical price tags to start with? Another clerk in a different department explained they keep the item in the back for 72 hours before putting it out again. Presumably this is meant to discourage smart shoppers. Since then I have sent two emails and not recieved a reply. There are too many stores where pricing is lower, policies more friendly and staff less haughty for these kinds of tactics. I will be speaking with my wallet and taking my business elsewhere"
1,Great food and great customer service. Tried the Halibut with asparagus on the side with Pistachio souffl\u00e9 as the dessert. It was all DELICIOUS! My husband had the lamb with creamed spinach and ate everything (well with my help on the spinach bc it was really good too lol) I will definitely come there again when I have the chance.
0,"This was the worst buffet experience of my life!! My family of 6 and I went out to eat at 7:00 on a Wednesday and the place stunk even before we walked in, but we bravely walked in. Then were hit by a pungent fish odor and were a little wary but still wanted to eat!!! So we got our plates and then aimlessly began walking around looking at ALL of the dried out meats and sparsely filled trays. Everything we tried tasted like it has been sitting there for hours. We tried to fill our plates but everything we tried was horrible. All 4 of my kids hated all of their food and they are NOT picky eaters! It was there request to go to Chinese. After everyone was tired of being disappointed by the food choices and sending back full plates of food. We tried to get some ice cream.. OH MY GOSH --- I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO GROSSED OUT!!! The \""Scoop\"" for the ice cream had mold on it and was attached to the wall sitting in a bowl of brown ice cream water. SO DISGUSTING!!! I asked to waitress to please bring us a new \""scoop\"" and she brought us a spoon to get our ice cream out of the 20 gallon buckets.. A soup spoon people.... So when I walked up with my almost $80.00 bill and told them how unhappy I was with there food, service, and cleanliness of their establishment. The offered me 10 percent off lol or they would call 911--- I let them call 911 because someone was going to have to force me to pay for something I would not give to my neighbors dog....... WHICH THEY DID!! They called the police on my family (remember we have 4 children) because we did not want to pay for the worst eating experience I have ever had. DO NOT EAT HERE!!"
1,"Because of this place I would choose custard over yogurt or ice cream any day.  It is denser than ice cream and creamier so its amazing that it is less calories.\n\nThe only thing I would change would be to have more flavors available on a daily basis, but the pints and quarts make up for it."
1,"Not for the faint of heart. YES, everything you read about this location is true and when you go at night for dinner, it's especially scary but oh so worth the risk! \n\nOnce you step inside, it's as if you walked through the looking glass. The restaurant is huge, with a very large wine room that you can see through the glass walls. We didn't make reservations and our expected wait was 45 minutes for three but were seated in a short 15 minutes, just enough time to order drinks at the bar. Note that they only serve beer, wine (huge selection) and sake.\n\nService was efficient and our waiter was very helpful with suggestions. I was determined not to order regular dishes but was with some diners that aren't that adventurous, so no raw meat, liver or too spicy!\n\nWe ordered Tod Mun Plar, Garlic/Pepper Chicken Wings and Pad Thai. All were very good, fresh and more than enough to share for 4 but only three of us. Also, luckily we ordered  these typical dishes because it was all the non spicy eater in our group could eat, although the fish cakes had a little kick.\n\nWe ordered the Squid garlic, sauce was amazing, even just with rice! The waiter suggested the Braised Short Rib with Panang and Thai Basil Catfish. Here is where we tread the spicy fantastic. We specifically ordered mild and their mild is a regular joe's spicy! It was great and depth of flavors, even with the heat, were so good. Thankfully, the water server did her rounds regularly and filled our glasses each time!\n\nThe fifth star really is for the price. Six dishes and drinks for three (enough food for four) was under $100, unheard of for such great food, environment and service."
0,"I have to say - I was very disappointed. Maybe chef Gordon should visit his own restaurant with the Kitchen Nightmares... He would probably trash the burger.\nI went there with my family on Friday night. The place was busy, we were expecting little bit slower service but haven't expected to be waiting for the beverages at least for 10 min. Each of us ordered different burger. I decided to go with the flagship Hog Burger. It was the most bland piece of meal I had in a very long time. There was not a single ounce of flavor in it. It was like eating some kind of warm tasteless substance, my stomach was getting full, but my taste buds haven't register any kind of sensation. Similar with other burgers. They all tasted like the meat was heated in the microwave, the only difference were bits of various veggies or cheese. The buns were tasteless as well. For an average $17 a burger it feels like a huge rip-off. I love to cook. I use many wonderful recipes from Gordon's cook book on the daily basis, so my disappointment was even bigger. The worst culinary experience of my Vegas trip. S."
0,"It takes a lot for me to walk out of a place. However, this place managed to make it happen in less than two minutes. We walked in at 5:30 on a Sunday, it was a holiday weekend so I was not expecting it to be completely empty, but it was. When we walked in there were 3 waitresses huddled in the corner who just stared at us. No welcome, no hello, nothing. Strike one. \n\nWe sit down and are greeted by an entertainer (he was on the guitar) such a nice guy! As we look over the menu (as we still hadn't been greeted) I over hear the waitresses complaining about getting a table. ARE YOU SERIOUS? We are the only table in the whole restaurant, the ONLY opportunity for you to make money and you complain? Makes no sense to me. Strike two. \n\nWaitress comes to the table, Thao was her name and says \""what can I get you\"".  Uhh, a \""hello\"" would be good. Or how about a \""welcome!\"". Strike 3. I say to her, I see on your website its 2 for 1 happy hour till 7, what is included? \"". Nothing we don't do that anymore\"" she says to be irritated. I look at her shocked that A, she is talking to me this way, and B, that if this was true, you would think they would update their site to show the correct information. What Thao failed to realize is that this was a party of Diamond Members. As people that spend a lot of money with Harrah's, this was an extremely disappointing experience.\n\n I will not be returning to Napoleon's which is sad because this is one place I have wanted to try for years. Tip to the Napoleon's - hire servers that want to work."
1,this place really surprised me - from the outside it's a bit run down but it's very nice and clean inside.  it's also very reasonable - 2 games for 4 and shoe rental for $25.  \n\nthere is also a small arcade area for non-bowlers and they have a decent selection of games.  there are also vending machines for quick drinks and snacks.  their snack bar was still closed when we got there so we weren't able to try any of the food that they serve.\n\ni would definitely go back to this bowling alley!
1,"We came here on a Saturday evening and ordered \n1. Chicken and shrimp katsu, 14\n2. Katsu curry, 12 \nfor $33\n\n- Small restaurant. Seated right away.\n- Great service. Ordered in a couple minutes and got the food within 10. \n- Best part, unlimited katsu sauce! McDs should take notes! haha charging extra for McNuggets dip. shame. HA! \n- Katsu was pretty good. crispy. Chicken better pork here. \n- Huge pieces of shrimp katsu! My favorite! \n- Loved the pickled scallions. But 2 though....tease\n- Shredded cabbage. Yum.\n- Curry was very good. Few pieces of carrots and potato. Sorta better than Kaba Curry, but it would be cool if you can order their curry spicier. Slap a fried egg on top.\n- For better Katsu in Vegas, go to Yu-Yu for lunch! Better soup! No miso. And their pestle looks like bark from a tree! haha, even more authentic. I think it starts at $9. \n- For SoCal-ers, Meh, Yoko and Katsuko in Buena Park is better and cheaper. Usually $9 and you get udon with side banchan. You'd think this place is pretty steep. Over 30 for katsu here! What. haha. \n- Aside from all that, this place is fantastic and will definitely come back for more but during dinner time."
1,"I'm in bakery heaven!  There is so much to choose from and it all looks delicious.  I have already been twice and can see it would not be hard for me to become a regular here.  The interior decoration is very inviting and service is great.  They get bonus points for serving such delicious espresso drinks!\nI had their soup and half sandwich combo on my last visit - ham and cheese on focaccia with gazpacho, and it is apparent that quality ingredients are a priority here.  I loved the individual banana cream pie I had for dessert, the interior was light and creamy and the crust was flaky.  I got to try a bite of the strawberry napoleon, and would have been just as pleased with that selection.  \nI am excited to see businesses like this spread out across Vegas and will be sure to do my part to support them."
1,"I've heard lots and lots about In-N-Out! So when we finally made it out to the west coast, I told my husband that I was not leaving until I had had an In-N-Out burger. And let me tell you, they are worth all that fuss. I was a little shocked at the limited menu they have, but it didn't affect me in any way. I knew I was going to get the Double-Double Animal Style thanks to all the reviews I'd read. It was hot, and cheesy, and amazing. My husband had a hamburger, and it was really tasty and flavorful too, much to my surprise. Why are they not a country-wide chain yet? Come on In-N-Out, get to Michigan quicker!!"
0,"Do you enjoy grease saturated (not in a good way), subpar chain food, and being violently ill before you even have the chance to leave the restaurant? \n\nThen by all means, hit up The Elephant Bar! \n\nHaven't been since 2005 (dinner with my Dude's family) and 2011 (my friend had her Bachelorette Party Dinner here). \n\nSick within 30 minutes of eating a burger one of the first times you meet the people who are now essentially your in-laws? Not cool. \n\nPerhaps this review is a little off seeing as it has been two years.  But yeah, never would come here of my own accord. \n\nA star for fantastic service and another for great cocktails. \n\nOtherwise: Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
1,My husband and I just moved back to Ahwatukee and tried ALL the frozen yogurt places in the area!  Yoasis is by far and away the BEST and Cleanest location!  There are a TON of toppings there and the staff is great!
1,Open super late.   Great pizza.  Interesting crowds.   Always fun
0,"Not good. Enchiladas weren't even heated, tostada shell was stale, soda was flat.\n\nWe won't bother going back."
1,"A great place to go with family and friends, have Italian food and drink lots of wine. An unassuming place from the outside on a quiet street in pittsburgh, Zarra's is warm and cozy inside. Do pay attention to the many random objects on the wall, but do not let it distract you from sitting down and enjoying the wine and the company of family and friends.  I had the sample plate and it was perfect. A nice sampling of several southern Italian favorites. The wine kep coming, so we kept on eating and drinking.\n\nFor desert, try the cannolie and a nice espresso.\n\nNext time that I am on Pittsburg, I am going."
1,Decent breakfast and service. Cute little restaurant. The fresh squeezed orange juice was amazing!
1,"My wife and I have been waiting to try out Fuego Tacos.  We finally did on a Wednesday afternoon, and bonus - Happy Hour was going on when we arrived (starts at 2pm).  We were not disappointed and Matt, our bartender, gave excellent service as well as taco recommendations.\n\nWe had the Pernil, Carne, Chicken Street, Fish, and Barbacoa (don't judge us, it boasts tacos and we wanted to sample them).  My favorite was the Carne Asada.  If your a fan of America's Carne, Fuego is giving them a run for the money.  The chips and salsa were great, home made chips mind you.  The runner up for our favorite taco was the Pernil.\n\nNeedless to say, we'll be back.  Thank you Matt and thank you Fuego, a gem in the now dismal Esplanade.  \n\nP.S.  Make sure to validate your parking before leaving Fuego."
1,"I've been spoiled by the luxury theaters!!!\n\nThis theater is nice and very clean, but I still prefer the luxury theater that provide wine and reclining leather chairs."
0,"I want to give minimum possible star! Horrible food, worst customer service. While eating the dinner buffet, I have been asked twice. I mean guy couldn't see me eating the food. Tiniest Bowl I have ever seen at this place. You can't even take out the curry with a spoon out of that bowls. Please  don't waste your money at this place."
0,Just didn't do it for me. The food was bland and overpriced. I had a better meal at the Cheesecake Factory at the Biltmore Fashion Park.
1,Had an excellent experience here prepping our meals there and one of the best things was how great the food is. In fact the reason I am here writing this is that I opened a package of food to cook and wow is it awesome! Greg was really helpful getting us shown around and getting things working. Great Job Greg!! Thanks for making our day.
0,"The food is delicious. The prices are too high and the service is bad. \n\nI gave this place 4 chances. \nThe food was very good all 4 times. Delicious and fresh, but too expensive. The cheapest lunch pasta option is 7.99 pre-tax. without meat.\n\nAll four times waiting time  was over 20 minutes even though one of those times I pre-ordered online (40 minutes total wait time) and the other time I only took desert to go. None of those times did they have long lines or anything. Just 2-3 people. \n\nPeople working there are very unprofessional, unorganized and work too slow. They constantly look worried about messing up people's orders and can't organize the process efficiently. \n\nThat said, the owner/GM is very nice and friendly, always finds something to say, apologize for the wait, offer a drink etc. One time he added free cannolis to my order. Those were delicious! Nicely filled with great tasting cream. \n\nSo today I was passing by and went in just to buy the cannolis to go. It took them over 20 minutes to make those and when I got home I saw that all three of them had almost no filling at all! Just some filling on each side, but absolutely nothing inside! \n\nI might try other locations of this chain, but will never visit this one again."
1,"Fantastic happy hours. Had 4 appetizers and a beer for $26. Jake is the best waiter and will help you with the menu and beers. Took incredible care of us. Highly recommend the guac, street tacos, and veggie quesadilla."
0,Ugh. It's just not very good and the service is lacking.\n\nGo a little further to Pete's Fish & Chips. It is worth it.
0,We only went there because we had our puppy with us and needed outdoor seating.\nLess than mediocre food. We had:\nOmelette with Turkey - edible but not great\nTurkey Wrap - unappetizing\nOJ - watered down\nLatte - bland\nI would rather eat at the Herb Box.
0,"Wow. I can't believe this place has such good reviews. Either that or I just had the unfortunate luck of my first and only experience tonight with a horrible server  . I have worked in the service industry for ten years and went here with a former employee/ now manager of a restaurant. It is the first time we have ever left a zero dollar tip. Our female server rushed us over to a table, threw down menus, never even greeted us, and then hounded us to order (we got there at 9 on a tues, when they close at 10). So after rushing our order someone else brought our food out and we literally never saw our server again. I had ordered a drink, and wanted more but never had the opportunity to order one. We then watched as our server was spotted playing on her iPad at the bar. We had to yell out to her to please come over and bring us our check. It's a shame because the food was good, but I will never be back."
0,Thank god that I had a groupon for here because I would not be to trilled if I had to pay the full price. The food was ok but I server was just not on top of things. I think that's what made me not want to return here.
0,NOT RECOMMENDED. \nThe pho was cold and they charged 15% for service without even notifying the customers!!! We didn't even know until the check came out. The ONLY thing the servers did was bring out water and our pho. NOTHING ELSE and they charged 15% for service. NEVER COMING BACK EVER!
1,"Nice driver, his name is flo. \nThe bus came early but it start moving couple minutes late. He didnt do early check in he said he was waiting for his bos.\nThe bus is clean n nice seat too.\nReally affordable price for LA-LV"
1,"This is the best hotel in Vegas that I've stayed in. Hands down. I loved every bit of it. I got a totally awesome deal at the hotel because I had a two free night hotel package but then the whole trip ended up being comped... WHAT WHAT?! To this day, I still have no idea how we ended up getting that last night for free but I'm not going to question a great thing.\n\nThe hotel decor and interior design were sooooo chic and modern. I won't lie, it's a pretty damn girly hotel but I'm not complaining but the guys might. But whatever, they can stay at the Bellagio next door if they don't like it. But I definitely loved the chandeliers all around the ceilings as well as the purple color scheme... amazing! LOVED IT ALL.\n\nThe room itself was so cute too, everything from the layout, to the wallpaper and the L-shaped couch. So perfect. The bathroom was a little too exposed to the rest of the hotel room though. But the blinds covered that problem. Also, I wish the toilet had a separate room or something so that when someone was showering, we could still go in without seeing them. But it's all good. We were all girls anyway!\n\nOh and the view... we had such a precious view of the Bellagio fountain. GAHHHHH I LOVED IT ALL I SWEAR. There's really not much to complain about except for maybe the TVs not working as well as I had hoped. They lagged but whatever, who needs TV when you're in Vegas?"
1,"yum! this place is yummy! it is my favorite authentic mexican restaurant to take out-of-towners to. the doorman/security guard is so sweet and makes sure you don't get shot and that your car is there after your meal. the surrounding area is a bit tough, and i don't suggest wandering far from the parking lot if you know what i mean. the somewhat scary location makes everything a bit more authentic in my eyes.\n\ni made the mistake of ordering chicken once, and i was disappointed. not sure why ... maybe it is because they don't use all white meat chicken. or maybe it was an off day. or maybe i just don't like their chicken. i don't know. but now i stick with beef or cheese based items and everything i get is super delish. love the beans! they do 'em right. margaritas are freshly made and full of alcohol, not like the watered down versions you get from a stupid machine at other places. gotta love the free chips and salsa ... the salsa always tastes fresh, and they'll give you a super-spicy version if you ask. and they keep 'em coming, even after dinner if you want more.  try the carne asada cheese crisp as an appetizer ... it is huge, but so good that if you have more than 4 people at your table you should order two. if you don't someone's going to wish they had gotten more."
1,"Walked in at around 11pm on our first night in Montreal and were seated right away. This classic french bistro seemed like the perfect place for some late night dining. The black and white checkered floor gave the place a nice retro feel. Also appreciated how the walls were covered with yearly black/white pictures of the employees. Nice touch.  Very nice vibe. Good service. Great wine list.\n\nWe started with the bone marrow app. Did not fully enjoy it. It was bland without the addition of the salt on the table. \n\nI must be the only yelper who ordered the kidney dish (I think it was beef). The sauce was good but the meat itself was too spongy for my liking. Still I was able to finish it but I should've went with the lobster risotto or quail. My fiance, however, raved about his steak tartare and fries,  which I helped him finish. \n\nAmbiance: 4 stars\nFood: 3.5 stars. Good and solid, but not great"
0,"I was really excited to try this place because of the good reviews, however I was disappointed. When we first arrived there was nobody waiting and only 2 tables had people at them however we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. When we finally got a seat we ordered drinks from the bar they were out of three different things we ordered. The food was not that good. My chicken was dry and the chef popped hot oil on me and burnt me. Food was definitely too pricey for the quality. The sake was good and the staff was friendly but I would not recommend."
0,"The sushi here was only ok, and definitely pricy for what you're getting.  There are definitely places out there with higher quality fish and cheaper prices."
1,Came here for drinks. The bar and restaurant are on the second floor. They have an outdoor patio with an awesome strip view. Their mixed drinks were quite good. One thing that is +/- is that to exit you will have to pass through the gift shop. It's great if you are looking to get some souvenirs on your way out.Not so great if you are just going outside.
0,"My friends and I came in and ordered a whole pie... After checking in with them several times over the course of an hour, they figured out they hadn't put in our order... Instead of making a mends, they made us wait longer for a manager to come down and 'authorize' our refund... Truly awful customer service!"
0,"I ordered a a belt on October 7th, could not find tracking, called & e-mailed on the 14th, for some reason it seemed the order had not been placed by them. On the 14th I was told to expect delivery on October 21st, today is October 24th and no belt. I canceled my order, WORSE on-line experience I have had.\nBruce...Georgia"
0,"The absolute worst Italian food at the most outrageous prices I have ever eaten. I would rather eat at The Italian Garden than here. I had the veal picannte, tough in a horribly thin and weak picannte sauce. My wife had chicken parmesan and it was tough as well. Prices from $21 to $38, this place is way over priced even with the acceptable free white & red wine. The accordian man was cute but an annoyance. This is a tourist trap to be avoided. This food is worse than cafeteria food."
0,"Stopped in here for a quick bite around 2PM on a weekday. Had the chicken wrap, which when it arrived had obviously been microwaved and possessed no discernible pieces of chicken. A lot of sauce and warm gooey fried muck made up the rest of the interior of the wrap, although the lettuce and tomatoes seemed okay for the couple of bites I took. The coleslaw (side) seemed fresh and was enjoyable since that was all I got to enjoy this day. Save your $8...unless you like a cup of overpriced coleslaw. LOL \n\nI will give this place another chance, but they also seem to have a bunch of pretentious, a-hole, 50-something \""dudes\"" as regulars in the afternoon...which seemed odd (and uncomfortable) being the 30-something, pretentious guy that I am."
1,"The Place serves up the biggest portioned breakfasts you've ever seen! I ordered the meat and eggs with diced ham in scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, and toast. The meat and eggs were basic but good. The diced potatoes were greasy and tasted like the curly fries at Arby's! Toast was covered in butter. Probably not the greatest place to go to when you are watching your diet, but great for feeding a bunch of really hungry people! I like that they give you the option of ordering toast, biscuits and gravy, pancakes or tortillas with your entrees. Good prices for the amount of food you get and super quick service too."
0,"I often buy flowers for my S.O. and came across this flower shop as part of a local Yelp search. It had a high rating so I decided to give it a shot. I bought a bouquet of 12 roses and had them custom arranged. I gave the bouquet to my lady at 4 pm. By 10   Pm of the same day the flowers were dead and we were both very disappointed. This florist clearly overprices its flowers, has a poor selection, and seems very old in its style of pre made arrangements with a lack of attention to detail. Stay away."
1,"great quality clothing, boyfriend loved the t-shirts"
1,The Outdoor pool is a must do for the summer if you live in Vegas.  It's great for children and even adults.  The only down side is that there is limited loungers and chairs.  If you don't get there early you'll be sitting on the ground.  Still full for all ages.
0,"The food here is mediocre at best. I went after reading all the above positive reviews and was really disappointed.  The service was great, hence the 2 stars, but my relleno was soggy and my tamele looked & tasted like it was made in a factory.  The guacamole was decent and at $3 I didn't care that the margarita tasted like a mix."
0,"Sandwiches are just bread and a few slices of meat, not worth it for $9. Pretty subpar"
0,Dry cupcakes that I could have made better. These cupcakes rival Sprinkles which isn't saying much. We will gladly keep going to Sweet Daddy and GiGi's for moist and big cupcakes that are homemade. \n\nGross Tempe sewer smell in store as well. First and last time wasting my money here.
1,"movie + food + drinks -- I'm a fan! My only problem with this theatre is that half the rows consist of office chairs. After awhile, these chairs become some of the most uncomfortable seats. If you are smart enough to reserve some of the big leather seats beforehand, you are set! I wish this theatre was closer to home!"
0,Had a layover here....3 hours!!!! Did not enjoy it. Bathroom floors are sooo sticky and dirty. There are no really good places to eat. When you book a flight advice is to avoid this airport!!
0,"Worst Embassy Suites Ive been to in my life. They need to remodel the rooms, it doesnt feel like a hotel at all it feels like im in a cheap motel. Shuttle was 30 mins late and the breakfast opened so late. It says they open at 6am and we waited till 6:45 but they havent served the food yet, so we just left to catch up for our flight after wasting almost an hour of waiting for the food... Worst hotel ever! Dont be fooled by the name, my family and i love Embassy suites  but this one is just awfully bad.  Not worth staying at all, id rather go to hyatt or renaissance just next door next time Im here."
1,"For a short stint while I was in college, I was a food runner for PF Chang's in the Bay Area so I became pretty familiar with their ingredients. \n\nIt says something then, when Pei Wei (which is quite a bit more affordable) uses the same ingredients. It seems like they take a little less time with presentation or garnishes and just do the bulk of the meal and have someone run like hell to get it out to you. \n\nThe staff is good but seem overstretched at times. On one occassion, I had gone to get a refill and my girlfriend had stepped away from the table for one reason or another as well and they threw away our food, which was about half finished. I mentioned it to the busboy and within minutes they had fired full to-go orders of both (since obviously we'd have some left over) and the manager was at the table apologizing. In the end, it was impressive.\n\nLast thing, I'm a simple guy, and one of my standby's is the Honey Seared Chicken. If you aren't starving, you can get a good sized chicken and rice dish by ordering the Kids portion and it's only $3.45. It's a total steal and they never ask if I have a kid in the car or anything. Abusive? Maybe. Effective? Totally."
0,"Circa 2002, I was pretty obsessed with Serendipity -- ya know, the romantic comedy with John Cusak and Kate Beckinsale.  There was that one scene where they were sharing that amazing looking frozen hot chocolate.  Because of that, I always vowed that I would make it to Serendipity in NYC and try the hot chocolate myself.  \n\nHowever, as many times as I visited NYC, i NEVER made it to Serendipity.  So, on this last trip to Vegas, my girlfriends and I made it a point to put it on our to-do list to make it there.\n\nWe fulfilled this goal right away as we made Serendipity our first food stop in Vegas.  The inside is cute and old-school ice cream fountain like, but we sat outside on their large patio.  Serendipity has a great location (in front of Cessar's on the Strip), but that's about all it has going for it.  Granted, it's the Strip, but their food is ridiculously overpriced (entrees AND ice cream).  I get that the ice cream portions are huge, but $15 for dessert?!  C'mon now people.  The experience was pretty underwhelming, to be honest.\n\nMy tip?  Check your hotel for coupons!  We, sadly, saw coupons for a free frozen hot chocolate in one of the coupon booklets once we got back to the hotel.  Save yourself $10!"
0,"Had a takeout entree of Kung Pao Chicken and called back thinking they gave me the wrong order as all I got was chicken, bell peppers, and onions in gravy.   This was NOT Kung Pao.  I was told \""We make ours differently.\""  Huh? Wish they told me this before I ordered.\n\nI'm worried about trying any other entrees especially since we usually go to a place that has awesome Chinese food.  I was hoping Wahsun worked out because it is closer to where we live.  I will say, though, that the egg rolls are to die for.  I've gone back several times and just ordered those.  They are large, made fresh, and stuffed with huge chunks of chicken, large shrimp, cabbage, and mushroom...yummm."
1,"Came here for the lunch buffet and I really liked how all the meats and side dishes were self-serve. The only difference between the lunch and dinner buffet is that you get the LA Kalbi as an option for dinner. There were random Chinese food options (chow mein, dim sum, etc) and Korean food options (soups, porridge, etc). Grill the kimchi on the side while grilling the pork belly and that combination is always so good~"
0,"My boyfriend and I went here for his sister's birthday. The place is just okay in my opinion, but he was not a fan and said the bathrooms were gross. Overall, not impressed and we probably won't be going back."
1,"Love this place.  Great desserts in a great area.  The area is really cool, looks like they took a neighborhood, asked the residents to leave and turned the houses into places of business.  But nice businesses.  I'm sure that's not what happened, but it's a great neighborhood.\nLots of different delicious looking flavors.  I go with the ever safe chocolate every time.  Yummy.\nService was great and place was cute.  Check it out."
0,WTF Jose Andres!  I was so disappointed with this place - I feel like he just opened a restaurant with uninspired recipes he found in random places and slapped his name on it.  \n\nThere was nothing special at all going on here. Had about 7 dishes and not a single one excited me.  Definitely pass.
1,"Love this place.  Great food, large portion sizes, great service, and reasonable prices.  All Big Fat Greeks are pretty much the same to me and I love them all.  I know its not hoity toity fancy schmancy, but I don't care.  I enjoy prompt service, large portions of good food, and consistency and this place delivers all 3."
1,"Small but great selection.  Definitely worth the trip.  Also, best time to shop is right after Christmas!"
1,You can't beat the of the view of the city! Great customer service and the food is out of this world. I highly recommend the scallops and pork belly as a starter.
0,"Its amazing how fast a place can go from 5 stars to 1 by providing poor customer service. I went in the very next day for a business lunch and was treated very poorly by the staff and took 45 minutes for two meals while we were one of only three tables. I asked to speak to the manager  (the owners wife) and she was too busy to chat it up with paying customers. I interrupted her \""meeting\"" to ask her to pass my contact info to TC so I could discuss the poor service with him. It was very obvious to me that the employees were not happy when TC was gone. A completely different restaurant on this visit. I would not suggest visiting this establishment until they decide that consistent quality and service are vital. I waited a couple weeks for the phone call that never came!"
1,"Inside the mekong palace there is a separate area to the side that is actually a small Hot Pot restaurant.  While the restaurant area is fairly small they made it very functional, each table has two burners built so that everyone can have their own broth. They had a great selection of food to choose from (from your typical sliced beef to razor clams) after you order you walk to the front and they have a table that is just for all of the sauces you can mix yourself. They gave you so many options and it was nice to be able to make more than just one sauce. The meal turned out great and the service was good  Overall I was pretty impressed, it reminded me of having a family dinner at my mother in-law's house. So if you are looking for a good place to enjoy hot pot without all the troubles of doing at home but just as good make sure you check this place out."
1,"I just went here for lunch today (1-4-14) with my brother, after hearing many good things about this place. \n\nI have to say, the food is great and the owners are wonderful people. I normally don't comment on each and every place I go to eat, but this experience really earned it. \n\nWe ordered the beef and lamb gyro with spicy sauce and their seasoned fries. The gyro was amazing, and the fries come with a really nice garlic / herb  paste that has a very unique and pleasant taste. The prices are fair and the seating/ambiance is comforting. Its a small mom and pop shop so its not a fancy dining experience, but it's a very cozy, comfortable and causal place to eat. \n\nEven better than the food is the hospitality. The owners are both very sweet and friendly. I will definitely be coming back here to eat, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes authentic Greek or Mediterranean food."
0,"Well, I was in the area visiting a friend, and upon leaving figured I would stop in this little place to see what it was like.  Well, upon browsing around the place for a bit, just really checking it out, I was asked probably four times if I needed help, despite being well--dressed (I could understand if I looked like a ghetto rat), and replying, \""No, thanks -- just browsing.\""  Upon my answer, the employee would give me the most patronising, fake smile I've ever seen.  Honestly, if you compared her smile to that of a Barbie doll, I would be hard pressed to find the living one.  Upon picking something, despite the nagging, the same employee told me what she would recommend.  However, I informed her that I still wanted my item, because it was better.  She again recommended something.  \nThis was either her first sales job, or she didn't like my Romney/Ryan shirt, and thus was trying to get me out of her \""store\"", if one can call it that."
0,Terrible food and service. The kitchen is SLOW. The food is luke warm at best. The only thing good is the Cider.
1,"This place is unique in the Montr\u00e9al area, a genuine treasure, so much that it's worth crossing the bridge for - it's THAT good!!! Some of the best croissants and danishes in the greater Montr\u00e9al area, pure butter, flaky, decadent and the classic French pastries are to die for as well - decadent baba au rhum, religieuses, \u00e9clairs and much more. I believe their pastry chef is from France but French or not, this is pastry-making of the highest order. \u00d4 G\u00e2teries also has a wondeful outdoor terrace which is wonderful to experience, since it's in Old Longueuil and on the side of a residential street, you have a feeling of SPACE and calm, which you don't get in Montr\u00e9al. The inside is lovely as well, with classical music and is delightful for a Saturday or Sunday breakfast-lunch. They also sell morning pastries in discount bags. May we mention how even the muffins are tasty as well? Special mention for the Cranberry (morning) pastry, raspberry pastry and one of the best abricotines in town - the closest you get to that in Montr\u00e9al are the danishes from Co'Pains D'Abord. A MUST visit for croissants and pastry afficionados and again, totally Worth crossing the bridge for."
1,"How have I never given Trader Joe's a review?! It is hands down my favorite grocery store in the world. \nThe variety of food choices is amazing. The produce is great, frozen food items (which I normally don't get) are delicious. The ready-made salads have made my life (not exaggerating). I've been relying on those things for years for lunch time meals.\nThe WINE! Desserts! Cheese! Meats! I could go on and on...\nBeyond that, the customer service is outstanding and I ALWAYS leave the store smiling because the person at the register took the time to have a personal conversation with me. Truly an amazing store, and I'm SOOO glad this one is around the corner from my new office.\nHallelujah!!!"
0,"I plan on speaking with both the police department as well as the Attorney General about my most recent experience with 24/7. My son locked himself in his bedroom so I called 4 companies to see who could come out immediately before I called the fire dept. 24-7 quoted a 15 time frame. About 30 min later I called the \""technician\"" to find out what his location was and in a slurred speech he stated he was 6 miles away. He was rude and very annoyed by my call. I was at his mercy to have him unlock the door so I was kindly asked him to let me know if he has any trouble finding my home. 20 minutes later I called back and he wouldn't answer. I called the company back and the dispatch (female) told me that she would call him and call me back. She called me back about 7 min later and stated that he was pulling up now. I was relieved and ran outside. Nobody was there. I called her back about 5 minutes later and she said she would call me back. I never got a call back. It was now 1 hour and 20 minutes from a 15 min quote. She stated that she could not reach the technician and that I should call someone else. I was extremely disapointed and now needed to call the police. I called the police and explained the situation, they were very surprised by the situation and the fact that the technician was now MIA. The fire dept and police dept came out and fortunately took care of it. About 10 minutes later I received a phone call from the dispatch at 24-7 locksmith stating that the techinician is not someone that actually works for them however it is a friend of one of their employees and that he had been pulled over and detained by an officer. This is completely UNACCEPTABLE! Not only was this individual pulled over and detained for a good reason however they are sending someone into my home that is NOT an employee? Fortunately we have family in law enforcement and surveillance in our home otherwise I would feel very unsafe! I have asked for a call from the owner and never heard back. I will report this becuase this is NOT OK!"
1,The food here is really good!! I've try the panini and for desert I've try theirs gelato. Really good!!! Great service.!!!
1,"I have a home and a rental home in Las Vegas and BOTH homes needed to have new systems this summer. After getting estimates from the \""big boys\"" in the business, I called a real estate broker friend of mine and asked who he used for the 20 or so homes he owns in the valley. He says that Jeremy Davis with Your Air Conditioning and Heating is who he had been using for years and he had been most satisfied!!! That was good enough for me....so I called Jeremy and he went to both properties, assessed the situations, explained all my options to me and once I decided on the system (Trane), he got back to me with very professional proposals spelling out everything including warranty, etc. He gave me a discount for multiple properties, but \neven before discount, his price was significantly lower than the 5 estimates I had done by the \""big boys\"" in the business.  He is totally reliable, works right along beside his employees and goes beyond the call of duty to give the BEST service I have ever had!!!!  I am thrilled and I cannot believe that there is a review by Roger somebody that is so negative!!! There has to be something else going on here!!! If you need service for heating or cooling you would definitely be doing yourself a favor to give these people a call!!!"
1,"Food City has the absolute BEST prices on produce that I've ever seen anywhere in AZ, CA, or HI. When I first saw the Wednesday circular advertising avocados 5/$.99 and 8 lbs. of roma tomatoes for $.99, I knew that there had to be a catch. I scurried down to Avondale as fast as my little honda could take me, and alas, the ad was real, and I scored 4 massive bags of produce for a whopping.... $12. You have to buy what's on sale, and I haven't bought much here other than produce, as I don't find their grocery prices to be outstanding, but for fruits and veggies, there's no better place IMHO. \n\nAs an added bonus, with all of the Mexican music playing throughout the store, I'm learning a little bit of Spanish. Ole!"
1,"Went here for their soft opening last night and had an amazing time!  \n\nThis is definitely going to be the new hot spot in downtown Phoenix.  You absolutely have to try the Solero, it's one of the best cocktails I've had in a long time.  I can't wait to go back!"
1,"Love this place!  We are there every Sunday morning for breakfast.  Everything is good.  Huge portions.  Big fan of the hopple popple and corned beef hash.  Pancakes, oatmeal and omelets are great as well.\n\nThe staff and service are outstanding, a great place to go, relax and have the best breakfasts!\n\n Love to sit on the patio."
1,"I recently went here for happy hour after discovering Roka Akor on the Whistl app for iPhone. It showed me their happy hour items and I was more than impressed by what they had to offer.\n\nWe got got a couple \""Chibi\"" Burger ($3), the Yakiniku Skewer ($5), the Brussel Sprouts ($5.50), and some of their amazing Shochu (50% off).  The slider was very flavorful. The meat was juicy and the wasabi aioli added a nice element to it. One thing I love about Roka is their sauces, all of them are top notch. The Skewers were also very good. More or less what you would expect, but the sweet garlic glaze really made the dish. The brussel sprouts are probably one of my favorite dishes from this place. They were crispy, with their own hose made mustard and bonito sauce. I never really liked brussel sprouts until I had them at Roka. The shochu is definitely a must if you have never tried it. I would compare it to a vodka-like drink, but infused with flavors that can make it even have a bourbony taste. I got the chile-melon flavor. The spice is very subtle, as well as the sweetness, which I liked very much. It was very refreshing, and very unique. I believe the flavors are all seasonal, so there's always something new to try!\n\nAfter discovering them on Whistl, we have been back a couple times for their happy hour and their dinner. The dinner can be quite pricy, but it is worth every penny. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. This is now probably one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. The food is always perfect, and the service is second to none. Also, a great atmosphere.\n\nIf you're a foodie like me, and want to find great deals in the area, definitely check out Whistl for iPhone. It's free and no advertisements or sign up!\n\nHappy Eatings!"
0,"Ok, so a year later, I came back with the hope that the beer selection had improved.  After all, the trend is for restaurants and bars to improve craft beer selection.  I'm disappointed.  No craft beer on tap, and a couple of generic craft beers in the bottle. \n\nI can't imagine it would take much to get a variety of real craft beer ... several IPAs, some witbiers/hefe selections, and perhaps some stouts and porters. It would be an easy way to attract the beer aficionados with the money and interest to come in and have some quality beer. The food is GREAT, it's just that the beer selection SUCKS. Probably the last time I come into this place ... bummer."
1,"Excellent service...everything is homemade...the prickly pear cream soda was our favorite. I had the mandrew sandwich buffalo style, it was excellent. Wife had the turkey pickle Brie and loved it. Well definitely be back and the happy hour seems like a great deal so well come back for that. Overall cool experience, they make their own soda if you haven't seen...which can be taken home in growlers...and they do a ton of really unique floats if you're only looking for a snack."

0,"Store review:\nHow can two meijer be so different? I read the reviews and was thinking it couldn't be that different because the meijer is a corporate store... I was wrong. First the store itself is a lot smaller than the one in Champaign. I agree that the layout is completely weird and someone should be fired. You walk in and you get the fresh fruit/vegetable that transitions into the normal grocery shelves, but where is the dairy milk and frozen food. Oh it is located in the center of the store by the clothes. I completely did not believe this.... Overall it is a meijer that is smaller but still well stocked. I am going to the Champaign location because it is significantly closer to home and larger as well\n\nPros: good sales on fruits/meats weekly, large inventory\n\nCons: weird store layout, look out for the dairy and frozen food elsewhere, smaller than other stores\n\nHidden deals:\n1. Join mperks for coupons that you can add online\n2. Free antibiotic and pre-natal vitamin through the pharmacy\n3. Earn money back in credits with prescription refills, check online"
0,Horrible service.  I called for a cab and they informed me that someone would be here in 45-60 minutes and that the driver would call me when he arrived.  No one ever showed up.  I called back to talk to the company and was informed no one was in the area to take the call.  I asked why no one called me to inform me and she stated that I was supposed to call them back to check on the status.  No one ever told me I needed to call back to check the status.  I am a business owner and communication with your customers is key.  I will never recommend this cab company to anyone.  STAY AWAY FROM DESERT CAB
0,"Never staying her again. Got  a good deal from Expedia, and I got what I paid for. Room is ooooooold and rough. It's good if you aren't going to spend much time there. It's also located mid strip which can be a plus if you are doing any exploring. And the monorial is located at the back of the  hotel which made for easy and cheap traveling which was a plus."
1,"Came here only for beer on Sunday night...they had plenty of beer to choose from here and the bar was barely full when I got here.  The bartenders were very welcoming and I got to see their beer menu from their iPad!  It's kind of cool although I'm not sure how they update it if one of their kegs gets changed?\n\nEven though this place seems very fine dining from the outside looking in, the bar area was very lively in terms of banter and all.  I got recommendations for post work karaoke spots as well as their favorite go-to songs to sing(one of them was Ignition Remix by R. Kelly).  \n\nIn terms of the beers that I tried, I had a very mild sour beer along with a light hefeweizen and the bartender staff helped tremendously by letting me taste some samples to help me make my decision.\n\nEven though I knew that the prices for beer in here would be higher than, say a off-Strip location, I wouldn't mind coming back here to Public House in the Venetian.  It seems fancy from the outside but it really is a comfortable place to relax and have a refreshing cold beer from their many selections."
1,"They can't seem to make up their mind what to call this place!  The sign outside says \""China King Buffet\"", their business card says, \""Super China King Buffet\"", & when I asked the hostess about \""King Buffet 2000\"" (the heading here), she said, \""Yes, that's us too\"".\n\nWhatever the name is, this place is excellent!  Norm R., Mike C., & I stopped in here today for lunch, & I started with some Hot & Sour Soup that was really tops.  From there, it was on to around 90 total food choices, including Mongolian Barbecue & sushi.  I really enjoyed everything I had room to try, & my only regret was that I got full before I could get to everything that I wanted.\n\nThey call the dining room \""cozy\"" on the front window.  To me, that would be Copper Kettle in Tempe, not this big place, but it does have a comfortable dining room, divided into several sections & softly lit while the lighting over the food serving trays is nice & bright.\n\nAlong with everything else, there were lots of fish & seafood selections, including delicious Ceviche!  (I don't know what they're doing with THAT here, but they DID remember to have tostadas to put it on!)  Also, a lot of the usual things that you expect were especially good, such as the fried chicken.  There were great desserts too, & even the service was especially friendly & attentive.  All this for $8.99, & Seniors less.\n\nI love \""?? King Buffet ??\"" & can't wait to go back!"
0,"If this was the last car wash on earth and my car was caked with mud, I'd wait for rain before I'd go here again.\n\nThe scam starts when you pull up. The try to upsell you and then get nasty when you don't bite. They lie about how long it will take and then shrug when they go past it. In every situation, you lose with these people. They could wreck your car between vacuum and drying and you'd somehow be to blame for it.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the lack of accountability or responsibility.  Oh yes, and considering they took almost an hour to do a mid-level car wash, it was a bad job!  Dust on the inside and streaks on the outside. A five year old could do a more professional job!\n\nIf you want a decent car wash nearby, go to the car wash on the NE corder of 99th and McDowell. Priced about the same and they do it quickly and efficiently."
1,"This park has recently undergone a much needed facelift.  It is located in Chandler off of Alma Achool Rd.  It is very large and has lots of mature shade trees.  \nThere is a park with the park that is comletely enclosed and features fun obstacles for dog's and their owners to enjoy.  This is also helpful for wimpy dogs like mine who do not like to leave their owners feet instead of frolic around in the bright sunshine.  I'm sorry...I meant the very big strong protective dogs who stay on the job and protect their owners at the cost of giving up frolicing around in the sunshine.  Yeah, that's what I meant.\nI have seen only a few fights and they were not too bad.  I have also seen just a couple of dog skirmishes.  Again nothing serious.\nWhen I went there very recently, I could not help but notice, how clean it was.  There were very few unclaimed piles of turd (dog) lying around.  \nI really appreciated the new bricked pathways into the inner park.  before there was mostly lots of mud and large puddles of who knows what.\nThe people I have encountered at Shawnee have been very pleasant and acted as responsible owners (parents).\nI will be back and hope to meet you there, but please don't make fun of my  dogs, though."
1,"I shop at this location more often because it' better stocked, it feels like there is more space to maneuver around the aisles, the store layout  is better organized, cleaner, there's hardly anything out of place. Plus they have a better selection of NYX products here!\n\nThere is always a sales associates on the floor. Ones who are real friendly and willing to help you. Most are knowledgeable in hair and makeup. Cashiers are pretty efficient and there's hardly ever a long wait. Just so much easier to shop here as opposed to the other Henderson location.\n\nLike all Ultas ,they carry both designer and drug store brands. Although some of the higher end brands the product line is limited to the best selling items.\n\nUse their rewards program. It pays off. The last time I reached Level 13..it only goes to level six I think. But they figured it out that I got $80 credit for fragrance, which was pretty sweet!"
1,"Absolutely luv this place! Tina is my go-to manicurist & she's amazing! Never have I bleed from her doing my nails, always friendly & we talk the entire time! Lol I'm glad I found this place!!"
1,"Hello friends, \n\nThis place was (only because I moved across town) one out my two favorite spots to go to. It seems before you finish placing your order the food is coming out of the kitchen. This was the main reason I was a fan of Pandas Den (PD). \n\nThe portions are pretty big. The wings WERE big as well but my last visit...well not so much. They wouldn't dare let you drink be 1sip away from full. On my last visit, the corner booth was Rank!!!\n\nGo enjoy,\nTTFN"
0,Fake Japanese by Korean. They don't even serve Japanese green tea. Always run out of Uni during lunch hour. What a coincidence.\nWeird rules to limit you from eating what you like to eat. They wrap everything with a lot of rice and force you to finish them before next dish. The wait in between well make you out of appetite directly. It's full of craps. Next one..
0,This location has filled three orders for me in their drive through. Unfortunately two of three times the order was incomplete. They also don't ask customers in drive through if they would like condiments. Apparently it is a new company policy that the consumer must ask for them and employees aren't allowed to ask you if you would like them according to the manager I spoke with. This often leads to drive through customers having to go back to the store or go in side after going through the drive through just to get hot sauce if they forget to ask for it. \n\nOrders with only two or three items should be easily filled and easy to complete. Probably will not return due to issues with this.
1,This was my first visit here.. Customer service was great.. Seen the reviews and had to try the adobo omelette it was great.. They give you a choice for either hash browns or pancakes.. Also you can upgrade your pancakes to a specialty pancake which I did.. The waitress recommended the special of the day.. The Banana Foster.. It was good but a little too sweet for me! But I'm sure folks with a sweet tooth will love it!
1,"Ordered delivery the first time and went with the Mergherita pizza and was done for. The second time, I went with the Pesto pizza with chicken and it was just as good! \n\nHaving a conversation with these workers is a highlight of picking up the pizza. Such a great neighborhood pizza place. LOVE IT!"
0,"I came in with a problem with my hub on my rear wheel.  The tech I spoke with understood the problem, but the only solution offered was to drive to the Henderson REI.  He said that REI might be able to clean the hub with an ultrasonic washing system.\n\nI give them two stars because they did not fix my problem.  They did look for a replacement hub, but did not have one.\n\nBasically, there were three techs there.  One was actually performing work, and one was watching, and one was being trained.  Overall, the customer service was that of a \""hobbyist\"", and not a pro shop like Zion Cycles in Springdale (ask for Fred), or Pine Mountain Sports in Bend, OR - total pros - with prices posted at the service desk.\n\nI really can't say it was an overly negative experience, but the only solution was to send me to a different bike shop to get my problem fixed.  So, I cannot give them three stars which Yelp describes as A-OK."
1,a good buffet
1,"\""The original sports bar and restaurant\""? If by \""original\"" you mean old, this sports bar fits the bill. Located in a nondescript part of town off the strip, we weren't sure until we actually walked through the door whether this spot was actually still in business. Once we entered, we were confronted with a rather uncomely and smoky bar area; taking our chances, we proceeded to walk through a narrow passageway that opened into a back seating area with tables and booths. Very quiet. Strange layout, I must say.\n\nBeer is cheap (e.g. Shiner Bock for $2.50). We happened to come in during a game, so pizzas were half off. However, we wanted to try the famous STROMBOLI, so we ordered a small original one to share ($8.49). It was pretty good! I was expecting something dry and tasteless, but the dough was soft, crisp, and perfectly baked. CHICKEN WINGS ($3.55) were cheap and decent.\n\nOverall, having had low expectations for this dive bar, we were quite satisfied. There was an elderly couple across the room who ordered a large pizza (remember, it was 50% off). I think they only ate one piece between the two of them and packed up the rest to go. Smart idea if you don't want to cook dinner! The booth behind us consisted of a middle aged woman and her elderly mother: they enthusiastically ordered a TABLE FULL of dishes as if they were a gang of college jocks. I just saw the waitress bring them dish after dish. I think it was the mother's birthday or something. Or maybe just the daughter's annual visit. In any case, as we left, satisfied with our snack, we were somehow cheered and warmed by the memory of two grown women pigging out on some good ol' comfort food."
1,"Coffee and bagels! Very good!\nIf you love coffee and bagels and I do you will not be disappointed here! Everything is so fresh, and good quality, if you can think of a bagel and something to put on it (or just order off the menu) you will not be disappointed, I promise. Might have gotten 5 stars, but I would have liked to see the shop just a bit cleaner, not gonna stop me from going back."
0,"So, I decided to try the Flatizza, BIG MISTAKE. Had enough pizza sauce on it to make a large real pizza. The flatbread was so hard I couldn't eat it and the cheese was cheddar not mozzarella."
1,"I've been a member here for almost a year and I enjoy it. The staff is friendly and the trainers are very knowledgeable. There is plenty of equipment to use even when it is busy. \nI also like the fact that is not a super fancy place (although they recently painted and did a little refresh, which is very nice). You come in, do your work, and go home.\nThe memberships they are offering now are great - month to month for a cheap price - and it is close enough to home for people living in Ahwatukee that the only excuse to not go once you are a member is laziness (which honestly affects me every now and then...:)"
1,I have gone to this place two days in a row for lunch and tomorrow I will probably make it three. I had the chicken and onion rings the first time and the chicken and waffles the second. It was only $7 with a drink in both cases. The chicken has a nice crunch and flavor on the outside and is moist and hot on the inside. Can't wait to try the beignets!
0,"Place sucks now!! I few months ago this bar was happening, now all you find are annoying 21 yr old drunks celebrating their birthday. The drinks taste like gasoline.  The good bartenders all mostly gone, too bad this place lost their touch!\n\nThe only good spot in there is the laundry (speakeasy) room.\n\nWouldn't be surprised if commonwealth  goes out of business!!"
0,"It's Roberto's, but noticeably worse. \n\nThis is the only Roberto's that I have been to that is in a petro station. Sure, in other regions of the country that is normal, but the service is clearly slower here and the end product is significantly worse. If you can drive to another location, do so. There is a full-sized Roberto's on the WalMart-anchored stripmall on Cheyenne/Rainbow, although that one is not as fast as other locations either. \n\nMaybe it is just the NW. \n\nI have had the chicken burrito with rice/beans and perhaps the rolled tacos with guac. There is no condiment bar. It is really a piss-poor Roberto's, to be honest. Basically take-out exclusive since there are like two or three little round tables that most obese people that would patronise an establishment like this would tip over when they leaned their fat elbows on them. You've been warned. - E"
0,"Super friendly and attentive staff, the turkey in the sub I purchased was fine, but the rest of the ingredients were low-quality bland central and very little selection. \n\nWouldn't go back, sorry."
0,"Crappiest PetSmart ever! The grooming department returned my (extremely short haired Boxer) smelling about as bad as I left him. Awful customer service, dirty, & shelves are rarely stocked correctly. You're better off going somewhere else if you can. It's so bad locally that I've looked into ordering the food online and having it delivered to my door."
1,"Came here on a Saturday night at around 11:30 pm with small group of 4. Fortunately, my friend got us on the guest list so we got to wait in the shorter line on the right side of the entrance. There was a cover of $10 for guys and ladies were free I believe.\n\nThere is a dress code. So for guys, I would say a MINIMUM is a nice pair of jeans, non-tennis shoes, and collared shirt. I did see some guys suited up, so if that's your style you won't be too left out. Most of the ladies I saw inside were dressed pretty well with short, sexy dresses and heels. \n\nOnce we got inside, it was pretty packed. Still got a drink (a bit overpriced) in a reasonable amount of time though. The DJ was really good and played a mix of EDM and R&B/Hip Hop. I appreciated it. I can only fist pump for so long. \n\nThe bathroom is clean and unisex. I was really confused at first when I walked in, but quickly figured it out. The men's urinals is behind a wall so you aren't in full view of the women's side (fortunately or unfortunately? Up to you I guess.) \n\nThe outside patio seemed nice, but once I stepped out, I got hit by a wave of smoke from everybody smoking cigarettes and quickly walked back inside. \n\nLeft around 1 am, and the place was still pretty packed and lots of people were dancing. \n\nOverall, with the decor, ambiance, crowd, and music, it reminded me of one of the nicer clubs I would see in Vegas or LA. Would go here again. Like other reviewers said though, get your name on some kind of guest list though. The general admissions line is just way too long."
0,"The website and video is deceiving. \n\nWhen you actually get  inside its super small. I think the max capacity is 15 people. We paid the general admission fee which came out to be about $16 after taxes.  The admission fee includes the parka, gloves, disposable booties and boots. There isnt much of a wow factor to this place besides the fact that everything is made of ice. The video hyped it up too much. \n\nThe photographer caught me and my friend taking pictures with our camera phones so that was our cue to take off. They charge if you want their photographer to take pictures of you. Anyways, I dont think its worth it to come here. I rather spend my money on another drink."
1,very good tacos... love the steak tacos!!!
0,"Minus the TVs which are great for watching sports, the food almost killed me! It's disgusting I never complain but when I ordered the chicken  avacado sandwich other night it tasted and smelt rank like rotten meat, it was dry like it was freezer burnt that was left out open and then spoiled then cooked...ugg..Then I ordered wine it was so rotten I spit it back in glass ...\nYep I'm not ever going back there again.."
1,"I've been wanting to come back since the last time I came to lunch here with friend and fellow Yelper Dyanna L. Since it was my birthday, my Dad wanted to take me out to lunch and I knew this would be the spot to take both him and Joel! Boy, I was right! Still totally sticking with my 5 stars. Wish I could give more it was that good. \n\nThis time we split the Duck Bao. The duck was tender and had a little piece of skin! Can you say PERFECT! It's so hard to pick what you want here. Cause I want ALL the things. I went with the special, which was the PBBLT. It was Pork Belly with Bacon, lettuce, tomato and a spicy aioli on Sourdough Bread and a side salad. \nJoel got the Short Rib Grilled Cheese with Fries. He can not stop talking about this sandwich! He said it's not just the best Grilled Cheese he has ever had, but most likely the best sandwich he'll ever have!!!\nMy Dad had the Crispy Duck Leg with Rice. He was so impressed with it all. He cleaned his plate and picked every piece of duck off that leg. \n\nThe Staff is so friendly and very informative of all the dishes! I have to say if it couldn't get any better they have a Coke 100 machine! So I can have ALL the Diet soda flavors!!! Including my current favorite Coke Zero Cherry! \n\nYAY Fat Choy's! I can not wait to be back to eat more of your delicious food!"
1,"Grimaldis has great brick oven pizza. The crust is thin its made fresh to order and they have other sauces besides just tomato which we appreciate. They give the kids dough to play with and crayons as well. Additionally, they have outdoor seating and good service. All around a relaxing high quality pizza place."
1,Did a great job with a custom dual side-exit exhaust on my latest project car.\nOne side had to be readjusted slightly and re-welded because it wasn't lined up absolutely perfectly (took about 5 minutes to fix) but after the adjustment everything was golden.\n\nThis completed car will appear live on FOX Sports this fall as it will be sold to the highest bidder at the Barrett-Jackson Las Vegas Collector Car Auction.\n\nThanks Advance Mufflers!
1,"This place is a hidden gem. I can't believe I've lived less than 5 minutes away from it for so many years and didn't know it was there. It feels like you're in a secret garden, I'm obsessed. It's so lively and green and pretty you HAVE to check it out. You can buy tons of fresh veggies and all sorts of other things. We got some raw honey and tried some rhubarb jam that was delicious. Next time I go I'll definitely have a recipe in mind because if not I'll just want to buy everything. They have some samples for you too. When we went we tried the beet soup and the some artichoke bruschetta that was to die for. We also bought come carrot juice and walked around for a while and looked at the giant Tee Pee (super cool) and flowers and the roosters and hens and things. I took about a thousand pictures. \n\nMy only complaint is that it's only open one day a week for a couple hours. I don't know how well it would do on weekday mornings (probably fine), but I think it would be great if it was at least open both weekend days and for a longer period of time. \n\nUnfortunately since we'll be living on the surface of the sun for the next few months I probably won't be going too much but as soon as it cools down a bit I'll be hitting up this spot!"
1,"I was in Las Vegas for a convention, with colleagues from China. One of the biggest complaints that I hear from Chinese travellers in America is about the quality of the food in restaurants. I set myself a challenge to find a restaurant in Vegas that would serve the same quality of food that can be found across China, and I was extremely pleased to discover Yun Nan Garden... If you want to eat authentic Chinese food, this restaurant is highly recommended! \n\nMy colleagues had all been to Las Vegas several times, and were very sceptical at first. As soon as the food arrived I could see the smiles appear, and everyone started making comments about how good the food looked and tasted.\n\nWe ordered a full table of food: A wide range of spicy eggplant, duck, pork, and lamb dishes, and everything was very good (the mapo tofu was particularly excellent). \n\nThe restaurant is small, and off the main road, but more importantly it's clean and the service is very good. There were only two English speaking westerners in the restaurant when we arrived, but they were well served so there's no need to take Mandarin lessons before going!"
1,"This was a spur of the moment choice for dinner Saturday night..they were kinda busy so the sat us at the bar..Bartender super cute personality and suggested the blue raspberry sake which was pretty good..We waited maybe 10 minutes before being seated..Decided to split the special which was soup/salad/appetizer/entree (shrimp, lobster, filet mignon, and chicken) OMG it was AMAZING!! The salad was really good w/the ginger dressing..tempura veggies were greatness..the entree (because my date is allergic to seafood, I got the lobster and shrimp) And it was beyond delicious..The chicken and steak were pretty good for the bite that I received lol..All and all a great experience!"
0,"I went and visited with the school advisors twice and met with the VA staff 3 times before classes started to make sure that I had the correct classes and that I would be able to be fully covered by the GI Bill.  Two days ago I get a call asking me to come into the VA office, I do and am told the classes I have do not fit the program I am signed up for so I will only get partial coverage.  I explain that I have been here multiple times and been told multiple times that i am fine and set.  They make excuses and tell me I can pay for the classes or change schools in two days (over this weekend) and I might be able to get full coverage.  WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AT A SCHOOL."
0,"i heart that i saw Oasis and FOTC there, but i mostly love that i was kicked out of this A-hole venue for dancing to the CURE!  The Cure! that's right, the Phoenix heat bakes the life and Cool outta most everyone in the Valley of the Sun; so much so that if you are too lively at I dunno, a flippin rock concert, the cranky geriatric ushers act  up because they have no funds to retire. The dodge can SUCK it...and so can the mean old bitches and meth head grampas that work there."
1,I love their Happy Hour special. Their garlic chicken and hamachi kama keeps me coming back! Staff are also friendly and attentive.
1,"Who doesn't love the Bungalow?  They make my food to order...and I change everything.  Sometimes the cook even delivers with a personal message...lemme know how you like that, etc.\n\nIt's great for happy hour but my only gripe is parking is limited."
1,"The day we went there, we dint find any pizzas on their menu. We were kinda puzzled - isn't a pizzeria supposed to serve pizza? We're mostly vegetarians, so we ordered their caprese and vegetarian sandwich hot. was so good. will definitely go back!"
1,"Critter Ridder did an excellent job for us on a tough problem.  A squirrel had gotten into one of our interiror walls and died there, causing an awful smell in the house.  We called Critter Ridder and they came out within hours.  They found the squirrel using a tiny video camera attached to a long scope and removed it quickly.  The smell immediately went away.  Critter Ridder then came back out and sealed up the house so that no more rodents could get in the walls.  They were fast, professional and very reasonably priced.  Critter Ridder is a great company."

0,"My husband and I made reservations at Mon Ami Gabi for Monday (12/24/12). There was a line of people without reservations in front of us and when I approached the first host desk, the two girls there told me to go inside to the next hostess stand and tell them that I had arrived and we would be taken to our table. -WRONG- I waited patiently for the hostess to finish speaking with another guest (without a reservation) and when I told her our party was here she glared at me and said \""Ma'am, did you wait in that line?\"" \""I was told by those two over there to come in here.\"" \""Go to the back of the line.\"" I almost walked away from the restaurant, but went to the back of line and waited...for about ten minutes beyond my reservation time for a party of 10 people -without- reservations to be seated in front of us. \n\nWhen we were finally shown to our table, we were shoved against a wall. It took about ten minutes for the waiter to welcome us to the restaurant and take our drink order. He seemed really pissed when we didn't order any alcoholic beverages and went over the specials so fast that we didn't really hear him. It took forever to get refills on our drinks.\n\nWe ordered the brie, which was fairly good. My husband ordered the special (veal) and he said his food tasted good. I ordered scallops and mine were chewy in a bad way. Our waiter only checked on us one time in passing throughout dinner. We were obviously an afterthought.\n\nThis restaurant doesn't have its own restrooms. You have to venture out onto the casino floor in order to use the bathroom. \n\nI would not return to this restaurant. The food wasn't up to Vegas standards for the price we paid and we were treated badly by the hosts and the servers."
0,Showed up 2 minutes after closing time w a store full of people.  My three girls and wife are super disappointed. Not very customer friendly.  Tried to call the manager and nobody seems to care.  It must be nice to treat customers like this and not care.  To make things worse the voice mail has different store hours then what they used this night???\n\nFrom a dad who owns a business and would never treat a customer this way.  \n\nJon
0,"Not bad, but not wow.  Definitely not worth the money.  Service is lacking.  Not the \""Vegas\"" experinece and not up to Venetian standards."
1,"I'm seriously in love with this place! I went to the store for the first time yesterday, I usually shop online because I'm too lazy to drive all the way to Mandalay Bay, boy had I been missing out! First of all all the employees here are super friendly and helpful, they also let you try EVERYTHING. You can really tell they love their job and love the products they're selling. It's a good thing I decided to come to the store because they have this \""avowash\"" which is limited edition and isn't sold online. I had to have it, and I got the last one! I used it on my hair and body this morning and it feels and smells amazing! Things you must not leave the store without, bath bombs: these things are the coolest ever! you throw them in your bath and they turn the water all these wonderful colors, not to mention the awesome feel and smell it gives to your bath. Charity pot: really really good lotion, perfect for the dry weather of vegas AND 100 percent of the money is donated to charity and you can choose from a bunch of different ones! Their products are expensive yes, but let's think about what you're getting: handmade, vegan, and no testing on animals. To me I think it's worth it, and I fall in love with everything I've bought so far. \n\nThey just opened a Lush store in Fashion show mall and I'm super excited because I'm over there a lot more than the shops in Mandalay. I can't wait to go and pick up some of their makeup!"
0,"Not much to analyze....this is more Sysco slop straight off the truck.  Minimal prep required with minimal generic taste to match.  Salads drowned in dressing with the dressing full of enough MSG to swell your ankles up for a week.\n\nDazzling array of beers tempered by the knowledge that half of them aren't very good.  Must echo the review on this page noting that checking IDs of people obviously well beyond age 21 insults the intelligence of all concerned and tends to sour the relationship with the bartender from the word go.  Smug buttons with 'We ID everybody' don't compensate for legal overkill, intellectual laziness and a lack of common sense.\n\nToo many of today's parents of young children believe that any place serving food is fair game for the little darlings even if the establishment in question is primarily a bar.  One mother, who apparently was an employee but off-duty, brought the little heathen 'Crawford' (groan) over to sit him on the bartop where he grabbed straws and napkins out of the caddy and hurled them in random directions.  Of course, mom thought this was adorable - adults trying to enjoy an adult beverage somewhat less so.\n\nI don't smoke but perhaps a rethink of smoking bans is warranted if it prevents every establishment from becoming a branch of Chuck E. Cheese.\n\nit's a shame that local places have fallen prey to the same assembly line mentality as their corporate competition.  Duckworth's tastes like Chili's tastes like Applebee's tastes like Friday's.   Given that all are buying the same raw materials from the same vendor this shouldn't be a surprise but it is nevertheless discouraging trying to find a place where they actually use recipes rather than reading directions on the side of a box.  The quest continues."
0,"Maybe I'm not cultured enough to enjoy this place but I was soooo annoyed this night.  I think with all the gambling losses, the walking around aimlessly trying to find this place just pissed me off and the fact that they were going to charge me if I didnt show.  I spent about 30 minutes walking aimlessly asking mandalay bay workers where this place was and NOBODY KNEW.  The elevator up there was pretty cool and the place itself looked beautiful.  Also some of the best service I've ever had, very attentive.  But very pricey and what I had was just ok.  We had the tuna tartare (must have), fish and pork belly.  The main dishes were just ehhhh...  THe caramel sundae I had for dessert was pretty delicious.  Again, very pricey and I'd rather blow it gambling.  =)"
1,We recently had AZ Alarm Company install a security system in our new home.The system has been working perfectly and very easy to use. We really love being able to control from our smart phones. I would recommend AZ Alarm Company to any one looking for home security. We have already sent our friends and family over to them as well!
1,"My fiance and I are locals, and took the tour as a gift from her father. We were very pleased with the selection of restaurants, and the knowledge of our tour guide Joel who did a great job providing history of Caesars as well as the restaurants we visited.\n\nIt is a commercial opportunity for the five restaurants involved, so the \""pure foodie\"" might be offended. We realized this early on, and enjoyed the information, the tour and the tasting.\n\nWe visited Beijing Noodle No. 9, Payards, Old Homestead Steakhouse, Gordon Ramsay, and Slice. The only disappointment was Payard where all we tasted was a truffle and a macaroon (we really wanted to try the crepes, which they prepared for us but we didn't get to taste for some reason). Slice, a fantastic pizza find hidden in the food court, was second best after Beijing Noodle #9... the surprise find of the tour. Inexpensive, tasty, and accessible is how Joel described it, and we agreed. Neither of us left the tour hungry!\n\nWe will try other tours as they expand in the Las Vegas market."
0,"Having met the man twice and finding him quite the entertaining character, I decided to try the restaurant inspired by him. Oscar Goodman. The (formerly) happiest mayor on earth. And former mob defense attorney. He and his image are quintessential Vegas. I had to try his steakhouse. \n\nEntering with a coworker at 8 pm on a Monday night, we were seated right away. Service can only be described as short and surly. From the hostess to the two servers we encountered, I consistently got the strong impression they were looking at their watches in anticipation of closing time. A stark contrast to, say, Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse over at Golden Nugget (see separate review). \n\nThe menu is mob-inspired, consisting of names of gangsters you'll recognize. I went with the Spilatro's Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. It may not look like much from the attached photo, bit it was actually quite good. \n\nThe restaurant is adorned with photos of Oscar and his career. I think the theme works fine here, and the location is great. It's in the area formerly occupied by Firefly, directly at the West end of Fremont Street. The dining area over looks the Fremont Street Experience. It's an excellent view. \n\nAll in all, the food was good. The theme was fun. But the service not so much. I'm always deeply disappointed when a place gets so much right and then just drops it all at customer service. How do other places like Vic's get it right consistently and places like this don't? I think it starts at the top. Carefully screening the right personalities to hire and then training and evaluating them. Consistently. \n\nOscar's needs to make an attempt, here. And until they do, the servers will bring down the house. This may be why there was so much open seating at 8 pm during Spring Break week. \n\nI sincerely hope they do bring it around because I'd like to see this place survive. If enough people point this out to them, maybe they will."
1,I had company in town last week and one of them had to eat gluten-free. I read some good reviews here about GF options at Carbonara's and I live right around the corner so we took a chance. My friend was apprehensive as Italian is usually at the bottom of her list since almost everything tends to be bread or pasta-based. She got the GF ziti and it sounded good so I went with the same. I've had GF pasta at home before and wasn't too impressed but I would have never guessed it was GF. She was also very pleased. It was homecoming or something in Mt. Leb and they were packed with large parties of dressed-up kids so the wait was pretty long but I took that as bad luck on my part. I'm not a huge Italian fan in general which is why I've never tried it until now but it's on my short list from now on. I saw quite a few customers picking up takeout while we waited so I'll have to try that as well.
0,"I typically love their beer selection and their food..... Until this happened:\n\nHi, I came in with a group of 10 people on Saturday March 22nd around 730-8pm.  We sat outside on the patio and our server was a young girl with pink hair.  I believe her name starts with a D, that is what the receipt stated.\n\nI am VERY UNHAPPY with my service.  I am a vegetarian and ordered a veggie quesadilla. I was served a PORK Quesadilla.  I even took a bite, not thinking about it.  She later came out and said not to worry that my veggie one was almost out.  No remorse, no apology.... \n\nI WAS SERVED PORK AND I ATE IT.\n\nThis is not acceptable.  I live on Knox, very close to this establishment.  I am furious that this has happened.  I am also furious that the server didn't compensate me in any way for making a HUGE mistake!!!! I paid my bill, for my quesadilla but obviously did not tip her for doing such a terrible job. \n\nI would like to be compensated for the terrible service and for the huge mistake your employee made.\n\nShe also broke a beer bottle next to our table and NEVER cleaned it up.  We had to step over broken glass to leave.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!"
1,"- Excalibur attracts a less upscale clientele but it's good if you know what to expect.\n- On Sun/21 Apr roughly 4 pm my friends wanted to play here for the $5 minimum craps and I was content with the $10 minimum blackjack (they had $5 tables but then the blackjack paid only 6-to-5 instead of 3-to-2).  \n- Dick's Last Resort bar has cheap drinks and is pretty fun.\n- Excalibur has an excellent location near MGM, NY-NY and Luxor properites."
1,"This show was awesome! No other word to describe it. \n\nThe jokes were hilarious assuming you can handle their humor. You can expect to get jokes about: sex, lesbians, gays, race, Nazis, politics, sex and more sex. \n\nThe seating is a bit tight and it can get warm in the tent, but all that is easily forgotten when you're watching the performances. \n\nThis show has got it all! Humor, romance, excitement, and much much more! Try to buy tickets online for a discounted price."
0,"This place has a hefty grey haired man with quite the crappy attitude.With his Horrible customer service skills, it's no wonder he's stuck working in this tiny gun shop crammed in the corner of the tiniest strip mall. Just went in on a whim, to ask a question about a particular rifle, and he acted like a complete DICK. I felt very uninvited in the store, and wouldn't spend a dime in this place nor 10 seconds of my time."
1,"I've only been once for a gel manicure, and I absolutely was pleased with the results. Very big part that made me happy was they did what I requested. This was very important to me being that my regular nail lady told me what I wanted would take too long and she was only willing to put the design on one nail as opposed to all of them. Mind you it was just a  simple bow, AND I was paying for it, not asking for a freebie!  I wore my manicure on vacation and beat it up in the pool and at the beach with little damage. \n\nI tried to return for new set, but the wait was 1.5 hours. Whilev that can be seen two ways, I just get ansy and want what I want when I want it. So I went to thebold place where I said I would not return. Although, I have always thought my old place was good, Ruby Nails is better. I will need to just make an appointment next time."
1,"Disclaimer: I came here after consuming a 1/2 yard of Long Island and 10-12 shots of Patron over a 6 hour time period.\n\nIt was easy to get resses here so we decided to run downstairs and grab dinner. \n\nI ordered the 20oz porkchop (being drunk, they asked how i wanted it cooked and i said \""rare\""). I also ordered a spinach side.\n\nThe food came out quickly and we started eating. I looked down at my plate and all I saw was a huge pork chop.\n\nSo, onto the tasting. I remember that the pork chop had a WONDERFUL sweet char on the outside and the meat in the inside was tender and delicious. It was THE BEST PORK CHOP I have ever eaten hands down. The portion size was large and the quality of the meat was excellent. \n\nThe spinach was just that, spinach. Nothing special, it was good and it was cooked well.\n\nI loved everything about carnevino except they charged us 4 or 7bux/pp for tap water. That is all."

1,"The ladies who were working last night were extremely helpful and nice\nThere were so many nice seasonal products out\nand we were in, looking for pillows\n(which means, we ended up picking up random things along the way)\nWe found some cute white ones \nand the employee was nice enough to get new ones from the back\nThey have lovely wine bottle covers that I picked up\nThe prices were very reasonable"
1,"Everything is freshly baked the night before! Their coffee and tea is also delicious! Every time I've been here, the customer service is also outstanding. I'm greeted right when I walk through the door with friendly \""hello\""'s everytime! \nI will defiantly keep coming back. They have earned my business!!"
1,The people here are very knowledgeable and helpful. The quality equals their reputation and if you don't go here you feel like a total loser because everyone does if they really love their significant other. (they've really burned that in my brain with their commercials)\n\nTheir warranty is outstanding as well. I highly recommend them.\n\nRobert Pfeifer
1,If you haven't eaten here...you need to absolutely the best brunch o have ever had..live jazz music unlimited mimosas and bloody Marys absolutely amazing place.the staff is excellent :)
0,Party of 5 went there on 11/24/2011. Food was mediocre. Most of it was undercooked. \n\nService was AWFUL!  We had to ask for water- repeatedly and wait long for it. Server gave us food for another table. He then brought out our food and walked around the room with it- not knowing where to take it.\n\nYou can get better service in a cheap dinner! It is outrageous for the prices they charge.
1,This place rocks the universe!
0,"I've been going to this Borders off and on my entire pre-teen, teen and adult life. I've never had any major complaints as they have never minded allowing my stay for the duration of many afternoons rent-free - and once they began offering free WiFi, I was in love.\n\nHowever, today - after an admittedly long hiatus from bookstore dwelling - as I was in the process of typing a blog entry and my laptop battery began to die, I realized that although they still offer free WiFi, they no longer have ANY wall outlets available for customers. \n\nWhat. The. F$ck. (Can I say that on here?)\n\nWhat kind of establishment - *especially* a bookstore - offers free WiFi without a wall outlet to recharge? According to the employee I asked, it's a \""health code violation\"" (wtf?) - funny, that hasn't stopped any of the other major chain bookstores and coffee shops I've frequented. I would have stayed much longer and spent much more money on coffee shop delights and books if I had been able to recharge my laptop to continue looking up reviews. And, if it weren't for the 40% off coupons that earned one star, I would have packed up my laptop and taken my business to the bookstore across the street that offers wall outlets aplenty.\n\nBoo, Rainbow Borders. Shame on you."
1,I can't say enough good things about this place. With very short notice we received news that my husband had to go out of town for work and wouldn't be in town for the gender reveal scheduled at the OB's office. I was recommended to John by a friend and he was understanding and luckily was able to fit us in the next day. We arrived at the office and after filling out a short sheet we were taken back to see our baby. John was very nice and explained what he was doing and all the baby's parts. It was a neat moment to share with my husband and I'm so glad they were able to squeeze us in so we could have that experience and see our baby boy.
1,"I don't even know where to begin!\n\nFood, ambiance, service, atmosphere, everything was above and beyond. \n\nWe were shopping at the Union and decided to stay there for dinner. Place looked great but since we never tried their food we were not sure what to expect. And then...What an amazing surprise...\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing. I had tomato basil soup, which was amazing. Then for the main course I ordered Baby Octopus that was served with mashed potatoes, old bay aioli and breadcrumbs. It was out of this world. The portion was really small but you do not want plate of entire octopus on it...just saying. \n\nMy boyfriend had Mushroom pizza with house made sausage, garlic and thyme. He was as well blown away. I had to have a piece because it looked so good and I didn't want him to eat entire pizza by him self . The crust was awesome. It was tender but yet crispy throughout.  It was full of flavors. I had to pick sausages out as I do not eat pork but he said they were the bomb. \n\nDrinks were to die for as well. We had Ways&Means (bourbon, sweet vermouth, 2 bitters, maple) and High Tide (gin, orange, lime, mint). They were very different from each other but flavors were amazing on both. \n\nService was just out of this world as well. Our server was really helpful by explaining the Menu, checking on us in timely manner and getting us exactly what we needed when we needed it. \n\nThis is a kind of a place that I will keep going back to. They have a beautiful fire pit outside, which is perfect to have a drink by on the semi-cold Phoenix nights. \n\nThank you unique but absolutely amazing Forge and crew, we will be coming back for sure!"

1,"Talk about gourmet burger! Very creative concept, delicious food too. Ordered the Rising Sun! Kobe Beef Burger, Tempura Avocado, Teri Glaze & Nori. Paired with Shoestring Fries & a sip of that Alcoholic Oreo Milkshake from my friend.\n\nIt was a yummy food experience but not a fan of the price. But I guess that's what I get for eating at the Cosmo. Haha!"
0,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would.  This is the WORST company I have ever booked with.

YOU CANNOT REACH A HUMAN BEING!  I REPEAT HUMANS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO TALK TO. I now am supposed to be leaving for my trip in 1 week and have no return flight.  This company is a total sham, they will take your money and leave you in the dust.  Oh one correction, when I got sick of waiting on hold after 2 HOURS, I called back and pretended i was going to book new travel, surprise surprise, my call was answered in 1.5 minutes.  When I explained what I was calling for I was instantly transferred back to the the black hole that is their customer service.  F__ U_  ONETRAVEL!!! aka Wk Travel #frauds #terriblecompany"
0,"I dont understand these places - what was once called a second hand store is now a 'Vintage Style Store' and commands huge prices and pretensious customers.\n\nThe only times I have been in here I have been for items for a  fancy dress costume, but I have seen others coming in here and buying huge amounts of second hand... err, I mean 'vintage' clothes at large cost.\n\nMoreover, I cant see the fashion in these clothes, it all seems to be rubbish and a lot of it looks like rubbish or a bit tattered.\n\nIt might just be me, but I really cant understand this place, its not for me at all, although I appreciate others will love it.\n\nOn a final note, the mannequins in the windows are the scariest thing ever. Look at them, you will know what I mean."
0,"Horrendous service - went based on a  recommendation from friends. It was hard to find, and should have stayed hidden. \n\nThe service was horrible - I rarely leave less than 20%, but this time it was warranted. The bartender refused to acknowledge my partner and I, and we were sitting in the bar area. She seemed overwhelmed. The menus that she finally gave us were sticky. It took her about another 10 minutes to get our beers. The pizza came before our beers, and there weren't a lot of people that she was helping.\n\nHorrible pizza with a sweet sauce, tons of unmelted cheese, and extremely thick crust. Now mart of that may be personal preference to have a thin crust, but at least everything on the pizza should melt, and it should not be a mix of sweet and savory.\n\nStay away from their beers on tap - all of them were extremely sweet. If you do find yourself here, go for the variety of beer from different breweries in the cases."
1,"This location has been many different restaurants over the years - this is a tough spot. This is my favorite thing it's been though. \n\nThe food is great here and the owner is cool. The prices are really reasonable and the portions are large. The place is really clean and the decor is nice. Everything is cooked in plain sight, so there's no mystery. \n\nMy only complaint would be that he doesn't deliver yet. We definitely need a good gyro place that delivers in the area.\n\nSeriously though - the food is really delicious. If you like flavors - it's all really flavorful. Great hummus too. Try the pizza puff."
0,Hard to believe it could get any worse? But under the new ownership there is not enough help so I waited 30 minutes and it was dead.
1,"We went here back in October and I forgot to come back and write my review. I'm giving it 4 stars based on my feelings that it was 4.5 or 5 but my hubby thought more like a 3. He wasn't impressed. I actually really liked my cotton candy martini drink - it was very very sweet and pretty original I thought. Try it. The bartender really wasn't very friendly at all though. Our waitress on the other hand was super nice and really cool about us asking questions about the menu. We had a cool booth over by the window which had an awesome view of TI and the Venetian. I enjoyed and liked my food. It was pretty big servings. We had the cheesesteak dumplings and those were yummy. The pretzels they bring out are tasty, too. Being from Philly we didn't think the pretzels or the cheesesteak dumplings were \""that\"" out of this world though. We didn't have room for dessert so we didn't have any.  Overall it was a cool place. They had The Office on all the Tvs, too, which was a plus!"
0,Unlike other posters we have always had good service.  We don't do the buffets-not really their thing and they should stop.  I would also avoid the salad bar.  The food is below average but not awful.  You could kind of say it is a Denny's type diner.  If you are looking for fresh and healthy this probably isn't your place.  I go there for my indulgence once in awhile of chicken fried steak.  Our kids really like it because of the airplanes.  It is more of a thing to do then a place to eat.  We go 4-5x a year but would never make it a regular thing.  I think if they improved food quality and spruced the place up a little bit they could have a real gem.  If you want hamburgers or other diner food not a bad place..They also use canned veggies-I don't think Denny's still does that.  They should use frozen or fresh-don't understand why they don't.

So peaceful with great tea, beautiful views and friendly staff. Love love love."
1,"This is one of my favorite buffets.  Great selection of food -- and the quality is pretty decent.  I'm giving it 5 stars compared to a lot of bad buffets out there...and you can always count on the quality and consistency of the Suncoast's buffet.  The staff is also super duper friendly.  The beverage service is the only negative, usually slow and disinterested.  The prices are reasonable -- and seem lower than most buffets.  The hours have been reduced the past year or so -- so its not open very late.  Worth a trip nevertheless!"
1,"The old Ale Asylum space is definitely being put to good use. With Underground Food Collective food and snacks, I have absolutely nothing to complain about. \n\nTheir beers are solid. Some are better than others. I really liked the SamuRyePA and the Silk Scorpion. The Nightrain smoked porter is popular, but not my thing. My husband got the red, which was not red at all. \n\nWe got pretzels and deviled eggs, which were delicious. My dining companions got the open-faced pulled pork sandwich, and wholeheartedly approved. I wanted to try the grilled cheese, which sounded amazing, but I wasn't hungry enough to justify it. Next time!\n\nAll in all, Karben4 is doing very well and I think has great potential. I would like to see more variety and more refined beers (I can haz DIPA plz?) but they are off to a great start!"

0,To me this place is just blahhhh...\nFirst off it's $8 for a pretzel and a drink. If you want any kind of sauce it's another $1. Tacky! \nI had the pepperoni pretzel and it needed a sauce to hide that it had more than likely been sitting there for a good while. It was hard on the outside and I have up 1/3 of the way into it. Oh well...worth a shot. Hope your luck is better than mine
0,"So I know I really shouldn't expect much of a Thanksgiving dinner from a hotel cafe, so I really didn't order the turkey... but even for regular cafe food - I was sadly disappointed.  \n\nLocated in Ballys hotel, the Sidewalk Cafe has a wide variety of foods ranging from breakfast to sandwiches and burgers to pasta and steak.  We ventured to the cafe on Thanksgiving evening and were pleased that we weren't waiting in a 2 hour line.  Despite the short wait time, the service felt as though the place was jam packed.  Most of the menu ranges in the $10-$15 range.  I ordered the prime rib sandwich which is like a french dip.  I was very disappointed when I received my food and my french fries were no longer warm and my sandwich was too large to even put into my mouth! The meat was pretty dry and I was hoping that it would be okay since they provided me with aus jus sauce - I was wrong.  The sandwich also seemed to lack flavor. I added salt to my meat, but it didn't seem to help.  Also, I'm a huge ranch lover - and was VERY disappointed that the ranch dressing just tasted... off... I even stropped dipping my cold fries in the ranch because the taste was so... off.\n\nAll in all, the others in my party seemed to think that the food was \""decent\"" but with so many places to eat in Vegas, I'm not too sure I'd go here again by choice."

You just can't go wrong here. \n\nOffering breakfast and lunch, everything on the menu sounds delicious and everything i've had was even better. I'd love to be able to say that i've tried everything, but let's be real here- it's a big menu. \n\nCrackers offers an average of six different soup selections every day, with one or two daily specials. Same with dessert- daily selections may vary. Both are homemade- no boxes or cans here- and they taste like the best thing your mom ever made for you, only maybe a little better. (assuming your mother was a good cook) \n\nThe breakfast offerings are hearty and full of flavor, the lunch offerings run the gamut from light snack to full blown food coma material. Great stuff. \n\nLike Meredith said, the decor isn't anything special- it hasn't changed much in the 15 years or so since  I first ate here. I think they're going for homey country charm. It doesn't matter though- this isn't a place to go for ambiance, unless you're a reclusive Mormon housewife. \n\nCrackers has two other locations- one out in east Mesa and one in Tempe. I haven't been to either of those, but this one is definitely a winner."
0,"I am a huge fan of shabu shabu....... it is hearty, healthy, and perfectly portioned. It's a great way to avoid your typical greasy stir-fry and feel cleansed after your meal (:  Let's just say I've been to several shabu shabu places on the east coast. \n\nThis place was my first attempt at shabu shabu in Vegas. I must say I was greatly disappointed :(. Best way to explain why is to compare lunch at this restaurant with my prior experiences at other shabu shabu places. \n\n1) The base broth I am used to is more flavorful and a bit darker in color. This place was almost like water, so I had to make too many additions to get any flavor out. \n\n2) There is usually a good selection of vegetables and plenty of noodles, OR you can 'build your own' by choosing what you want as a combination. Here, there were no combo options and the vegetables are the same for each and every order. Broccoli, cabbage, asparagus, carrots, and tofu. Would like to see other options such as egg, corn, bamboo, bean sprouts, etc...  Also, the noodle portion is WAY too small even for a child, and the only option is udon. \n\n3) Service. I believe the girl on shift that day was inexperienced. She was on her own and we had to keep asking her over and over again for the same items. They don't provide you with a bowl and spoon for the soup so we had to ask for it. They weren't provided until close to the end... \n\n4) I would say most shabu shabu places, if not all, that I've been to had the built-in shabu pots. Here, they use the portable gas ranges, which I don't think provides the same kind of experience. We were finally given a ladle towards the end of our meal, which helped with the pots being elevated pretty high... \n\n\n*I must say the positive thing about this place was that the seafood is fresh and the meat is good quality.... they just need to work on portions, more menu options (combinations, build-your-own, etc..) and have better training in staff for serving shabu shabu, because it's different than serving at an average restaurant. Hopefully, they will receive enough customer feedback to work on their shortcomings :)"
1,We stopped in here for a bite after the USA soccer game. I've passed by this location many times and was happy to go in and finally try it out. We ordered the crab/guacamole appetizer and I had the scallop rissoto for the main course. Wow wow wow! Everything ordered was on point and cooked to perfection. The crab was so fresh too. \nI will definitely be back here very soon. The next thing I will order will be the black linguini with shrimp! Can't wait!
0,Horrible! Read on the internet that this was a great place. Sadly it is dead and boring. Not where I would recommend on a Saturday night. Bartenders seem like they could care less about their patrons.
0,"While this resort is beautiful and the staff are very friendly; I have an excessively bad taste in my mouth.  I was there on business for 3 nights. My very last night I was awoken several times in the night to very loud  noises outside of my room which was very startling and scary.  I wake up at 6:30 am and open the shutters to the glass slider that opens up to the desert behind my room.  Low and behold there is a clear imprint of a man's side of face with the ear pressed up against the glass.  Being a single woman traveling alone for work this is alarming to say the least.  I promptly called security who was very nice,  however as I was checking out a short hour later the security officer had not shared with the manager my scary experience.  I had taken pictures and showed it to the manager. Following insincere apologies were stupid explanations like \""maybe a husband was lost and couldn't find his room and was trying to hear if it was his wife in the room\"". What? ? Um how about if that's the case you knock on the door to the room? ? Not go into the wilderness to press your face to a sliding glass door?  Very scary,  disturbing and should be taken more seriously by all staff.  My instinct is that it was one of the staff members. Being that the entire time I was there I saw a maximum of 5 guests I hardly doubt it was the lost husband scenario and if that is the case, to the wife, it is time to trade that model in. \n\nIn addition,  I'm not the type to ask for a discount or a return of funds but I do believe something should have been offered as I was very shaken up. And if you hadn't of guessed already nothing was offered up besides lame explanations and insincere apologies. \n\nBad taste on the part of the management and a bad taste in my mouth."
0,"I wanted to give 2.5 stars.  The food was pretty good, definitely better than average for Madison BBQ.  There were a few disappointments that have been mentioned by a few other reviews, such as the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce instead of homemade variations.  The beef brisket, although tender, was a little on the dry side and lacked flavor.  The pulled pork and ribs were much better.  Oddly enough, the cole slaw comes with the dressing on the side.  With most salads, this is what I prefer, but cole slaw needs time for the dressing to marinate cabbage, a green that's not made to just be eaten raw without some kind of major seasoning.  The Mexican street corn was delicious and unique to Madison.  The bread that came with the dinners had an odd flavor, like it had been deep fried in old oil.  If they could kick up the quality of the sides, I think the food could be really really good.  All in all, I'd have given the food 3.5-4 stars.  \n\nWhat brought the score down was the odd service and the setting.  The folks that take your order seem to be pretty disorganized and slow, whether it's the man that rang up my order incorrectly and kept asking me personal questions (not the owner Pete), or the young 10 year-old girl, who although cute, reminds me a little of child labor.  The place itself is a huge warehouse with a random, eery cowboy statue at the checkout counter.  \n\nI can see this place being really good if they can kick up the food a little and get a better-trained staff.  Right now I still prefer Smoky Jon's BBQ on the East side."
1,"I'd love this place for its relaxing garden ambiance alone. Go to the full dining restaurant and eat indoors or pick up a few dishes from the deli area downstairs.  The downstair area does not have the full menu, but is designed to get a quick take out bite.  There is a nice little patio (complete with comfy chairs and misters), which is perfect for lunch when weather is good.  No matter where you dine--the food is healthy and tasty, plus moderately priced. Check out their Jasmine Green Tea for something refreshing--it is perfect sipping for a hot summer day. The dessert menu is extra tempting, but I have viciously beat back my sugar cravings and declined to give them a try.  If I ever order a dessert, I will revise this review and add my thoughts.  \n\nParking is meh. It's old town Scottsdale, so good luck there. But if you find a spot, this place is near the canal and there is nice walking to be had after eating."
0,"I only went for an event in the back room. As I pulled into the parking lot, I saw a woman trying to cross the area in front of me. I flashed my lights and she started to approach my car until she saw I was a woman. So...  hookers in the parking lot? For me as a one year resident in Vegas, i was disappointed by the area and the lack of any kind of security present to disallow things like that. But it seems to have a very specific event following for certain burlesque and comedy shows which are in the back room. Other than that it's a pretty empty beer bar. Yikes."
0,"Meh.  I've experienced better.  I ordered a Thai iced tea ($3.00), the yellow curry with chicken ($8.50), and a beef pad see ew ($7.50).  The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  It was toned down in the sugar department, which is good for some folks, but if you are looking for that sweetness you might be disappointed.  \n\nThe yellow curry was pretty bland.  Even ordered hot with extra chili powder, it wasn't anything to rave about in the flavor department.  Apparently they normally make this curry fairly sweet, but I specifically asked for it without extra sugar.  I can imagine this curry with the extra sugar, and it would probably be a typical Americanized curry.  The curry sauce was watery, which I normally like.  The other thing I liked about this curry was that the chicken seemed to be precooked, and was very tender.  Also, the portion of chicken was nicely sized.  There were a couple of thinly sliced peppers though that were pretty skimpy.\n\nI also ordered pad see ew woth beef to go (to go with my Alpha Dog Double Red from Big Dog, yum!).  The noodles were a bit on the overcooked side, although that could have been due to my microwave (I have microwaved pad see ew many times and never had this problem though).  The noodles were a bit on the dry side as far as the sauce used, but that was ok for me.  The kicker was that they don't have Chinese broccoli, so this was served with American broccoli.  \n\nOverall, this place might be good for the lunch specials, but there are so many good Thai places around here.  The service was friendly, but a little slow.  The food was okish.\n\nEDIT: Its been a while since I have thrown out left over Thai food.  The soggy noodles were just gross.  In fact, I have decided to dock Thai BBQ a star."
0,"Would not recommend this to my worst enemy.  Boneless Chicken, terrible, step down from a crappy school lunch.  Salad, terrible. Pizza, also terrible, the box was tastier than the actual pie. Service, terrible, post high school rejects and not the cool ones. \n-try north side Nathan's or metro pizza"
1,"We had a reservation and arrived 30 minutes early, planning on a short wait. They had a table openining and were quick to clear it and get us seated.\n\nWe had the Domestic Nagyu Chef's tasting.\n\nAppetizer:\n- Shrimp Cocktail. Shrimp prepared perfectly and a cocktail sauce with perfect amount of bite.\n\nThree small salads:\n - Arugala Salad I am not a fan of Arugala salad, but theirs was excellent.\n - Persian Cucumber and Watercress, was better than average.\n - Itallian Buffalo Mozzarella with Hazelnuts, added a little twist that was very nice\n\n \nSteaks:\nRibeye and Filet for the cuts of meat. Both cooked to perfection and as very delicious.\n\nSides:\n - Brissel Sprouts, in season so on everyones menu and they didn't dissapoint\n - Au Gratin Potatoes, found out that my mother was undercooking the potatoes for my entire life. Both happy and sad at the same time, because I always loved my moms Au Gratin. Even if she were alive, I would have never told her this.\n\nDeserts:\n - Cinnamon Monkey Bread w/Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - Awesome\n - Sorbets, Coconut Lime and Rasberry\n - Chocolate Indulgence - Close second\n - Farmers Market Fruit\n\n\nThe only let down to the entire meal was that they brought us four deserts when two would have sufficed... It is simply too much after that much provided in the prior courses.\n\nThe service was top nothc from start to finish. A must stop for anyone. I am glad we did the tasting because I would have missed out on some excellent items i would have otherwise not have tried."
0,"Had a shirt taken to them to be serviced three times, and still they did not dry-clean it. I would hav been better off doing it myself in my sink at home."
0,"If I can give no star at all, I would!\n\nCalled them for a cabbie at 7:10pm on 4/18/13, gave them the location and waited for 15min, called again to check on status, the girl said still trying to get someone, waited for 35min, called again, she said it was a busy night and would call me as soon as she gets someone. Waited till 8pm, gave up! \n\nI then called Henderson, 9min later, the cabbie arrived. Great customer service too.\n\nDesert Cab means no cab at all and you'll end up alone at the desert. Do not waste your time and money on them!!!"
1,Best Chinese take-out in Gilbert! We've tried quite a few but none as good as this one! Customer service is always great every time!
0,"What a dump. I asked for a non smoking room. I didn't get one. The door man was rude and demanding. \n\nI had to leave, the amount I was asked to pay was a ripoff.; I'd rather sleep in the car!\n\n  My suggestion is to try some of the hotels in Summerlin. It's worth the drive."
1,I love this gym. It is extremely clean and the staff is very friendly and knowledgable . Tons of cardio equipment as well as free weights. A huge selection of classes to choose from. My 10 year old takes swimming lessons there and loves it . My entire family is very happy there.
1,"I'm a picky coffee drinker so I'm still working out the kinks in figuring out which drink I just absolutely love - but I will say the service here is outstanding!!! Such friendly, charasmatic baristas which I can appreciate early in the morning."
1,"Good, convenient, great prices"
0,Went in to get a quick haircut one morning and the stylist cut my hair crooked.   I am not sure how she did not notice because it was prerty bad.  Went somewhere else to have it fixed.
1,"Dear Yelp, it's official: I AM 21. :D\n\nFor my 21st birthday, I spent the night at a room here. I must say, quite a fun place to spend a 21st birthday at!\n\nRoom: HUGE. To begin with, it was already in the older tower and yet it was still quite impressive. Two comfortable beds, a couch, a chair, a table/mini-office space and a fridge....it was almost like a miniature apartment. The view was also quite amazing, looking right over the pool and straight at the Strip. Oh, and it had a fridge, a plus seeing I needed to have refreshments for the get-together I was having.\nService: Can't really say, we were just partying it up in there. \nLocation: Not on The Strip, but close enough, with free shuttle service to Harrahs and Ballys. \nPool: It was amazing with a bold, capital A. Crowded, but not overwhelmingly so. Beautiful people all around, and not overrun with the douchebags you see so much of at somewhere like, say, the Palms or Mandalay Bay pool areas. One cheesy, but cool touch was the waterfall that came out of a clam. \nMiscellaneous: As great as the room was, I was charged a security deposit of $50 that I had no way of knowing about beforehand. At least it wasn't a blasted resort fee, but still.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\n\nPros:\nMore than enough space.\nFridge in the room.\nLovely view.\nEpic pool.\nFree shuttle to the Strip.\nNice enough bathroom. \nOffered two free passes to the Voodoo Lounge.\nLots of things to do on the property.\nGot the room for a pretty sweet price as well ($53.00).\n\nCons:\nSneaky security deposit. It's refunded when you check out but still. \n\nSuggestions: Please let people know about the security deposit in advance. So next time someone wants to have their birthday there they won't be $50 short on drinking and partying funds. \n\nWould I stay here again? I'd stay here again just for that pool."
1,"Very tasty! We had the dolmades, the flaming saganaki, spanokipita, & gyros platter. The bakalava was good, but very cinnamonny. Would recommend this place to a friend. The staff was also very good."
0,"So you already know it's a 50's diner with outdoor seating, and we're in the time of year now where sitting outside late night is nice especially after the club. I've come here a lot with friends late night, and the food was always scrumptious and service excellent, but after last night I MUST PROTEST.\n\nI ordered the Bourbon BBQ Wings, a promising title appealing to my tastes exactly. They arrive with a generous bowl of ranch and a few stalks of celery. I know most people don't eat the celery, maybe that's why, so I guess carrots were out of the question.\n\nTHE WINGS WERE FROM BABY CHICKENS!!!\nI was shocked. some of them (both sections) were not 1.5 inches long, I swear. The sauce was yummy BUT I'M ANGRY ABOUT THE WING SIZE!!!! \n\nCome on 5& Diner, you're better than Long Wong's, ACT LIKE IT and serve up goodness on all fronts!\n(See my scathing review on them as well.) I want so much to write a glowing review here but NO.\n\nSo my friend got the Southwestern eggrolls. They were sliced open diagonally and nicely presented on the plate. I tried one, and eventually my friend let me have the last 2. They were hard and irritating to eat, and tasted fine for tourists as it reminded me of Rubio's or Arriba's standard. I think Jack In The Box could've put out a better product overall.\n\nAnother friend got the chicken quesedilla.\nAlthough I didn't taste it, presentation looked nice with the pico and guac on the side. The quesedillas were a good size and thickness. My friend took half of it home.\n\nI can recommend the burgers, onion rings, and breakfasts.\n\nPrices went up a couple of years ago to an average $9.49 for a burger plate, and slightly less for appetizers and other things. Service is always good, but don't go if you're in a hurry and the place is packed.\n\nBOTTOM LINE.... choose wisely. Last night I chose.... POORLY."
1,Perfect place for third dates and indie rock shows.  Food is okay and decent vibe depends on what bands are playing.
0,Have been going to Half Moon for years but today is the last time.  I ordered the grilled cheese with a slice of tomato and my guest had the bacon cheeseburger.  I had to search for the cheese on my grilled cheese and you could read through the slice of tomato because of the thinness.  The only thing good was the bread and the fries.  We were surprised at the size of the cheeseburger; it was half the size of the bun. The burgers used to be good size.  This is probably great for sports watching but for business lunch - I would pass on Half Moon.\n\nOur server was really sweet and efficient but the service was VERY SLOW (don't think it was the fault of the server).
1,"Their pistachio frappe is soooo delish! But because I went around 7pm, not a lot of desserts to choose....wish there was a Henderson location so that I could go all the time!"
1,"Fogo De Chao is a Brazilian Steakhouse, AKA an All-You-Can-Eat Delicious Meat dinner.  They also have the option of just doing the salad bar if you are not a meat eater.\n\nThe sides and salad bar have tons of fresh veggies, imported/gourmet cheeses, cured meats, and various Brazilian style side dishes.  Let's just say there are a ton of great options to start with so definitely start by grabbing a plate here.  \n\nThey have these cards on the table with one side green (go-feed me more) and the other side red (stop-I'm full or need a break).  Flip your card over to green and the chefs start to serve you fresh cuts of meat that are brought to your table and sliced right onto your plate.  Choose from chicken (even bacon wrapped chicken!), beef (at least 3 different kinds), pork, sausage links, and they even have lamb.  When you are satisfied then flip your card back to red.  \n\nI'm always so full that I don't have room for desert but one of these days I'm gonna try the Molten Chocolate Cake!  The table next to us ordered it and I was literally drooling.\n\nI'm getting hungry just writing this review. . . ."
0,"I lost 4 pounds of muscle and the \""doctor\"" took me off the program in 4 days.  This company does not know what they are doing with HCG.  I told them up front that I was going to the gym doing intense workouts, and they still put me on the program.  They offered me a partial refund, but I believe they should have been refunded in full."
0,"I came here just for a haircut. My hair was long, and damaged, hadn't had it cut for awhile. Nevertheless, I had enough to work with. I don't speak French, nevertheless, I said I wanted the dry ends removed and some layers. Pretty standard request. She started cutting from the top and cut it reeeeally short. Then it seemed by the end she realized that it was too short and left the last section at the back long. So now it's like I have a bob with some ratty long ends at the back. My hair is thin, even though I have lots of it, but now all the thickness is in the short hair. Plus it's not even cut evenly anywhere. Looks ridiculous. I will need to style it myself to see if I can fix it. It's not even long enough to stick properly into a ponytail anymore. While she was cutting I could see how much she had snipped off and started thinking to myself, about how long it would take to grow back. My estimation is 1.5 years. She asked if I was ok at this point, obviously seeing the look of despair on my face. I went on a Thursday evening... which is double the price, I thought since they weren't students? I think I thought wrong, save yourself the tears and go somewhere else. And by the way, I waited a week for this appointment.\n\nOn a side note, they did my boyfriend's hair too. For some reason didn't use clippers, didn't bother to clean up the back of his neck and didn't take enough off. It also took about 30 minutes longer than mine. He's not too happy either but atleast his is fixable."

0,"Overpriced.  Pretty good selection of rolls, but if you prefer nigiri sushi you can do much better.  Very nice modern decoration and ambiance.  The service is good.  The place is very clean."
1,"Always a key stop on our visits to the strip.  Yea, some of the stuff is past it's \""sell by\"" date so you have to be smart.  It's not always that important but be aware.  Prices are great to good on most items.  I'd give the produce slightly less shelf life than major groceries but about the same as other strip establishments.  Don't stock up, eat it fresh.  Good prices on coffee, canned goods, boxed foods, etc. and health/beauty items.  Sometimes I am amazed at how little we've spent for what we walk out with."
1,"Marie Minor Neugent is an expert at prenatal massage, God has truly gifted her with the Touch of Healing. She started giving me prenatal massages recently and my body feels absolutely amazing. I was experiencing severe back pain and leg cramping and now my body feels entirely relaxed and stress free. What a wonderful and special woman she is... I can not thank her enough for helping me through this pregnancy and making it easier and more enjoyable!!!!!\nI highly recommend that you see Marie for prenatal massage, it is a necessity during your pregnancy. Not only will prenatal massage make labor easier, it will also \nalleviate muscular discomfort, improve blood circulation and this provides more nutrients to both fetus and mother and stimulates function of the lymphatic system, increasing the detoxification of waste and toxins as well as improving immune function to protect the mother against disease. It will improve your posture, it helps with depression, promotes relaxation and reduces swelling. Swelling is very common during pregnancy because the body produces more fluids. Prenatal massage is the ONLY sure way to reduce inflammation as it improves circulation!"
0,"Worth a look - but def not worth the price. \n\nI could tell by walking through the place that they spent a lot of money on the design and feel of the spa.  Here are my thoughts on the play-by-play:\n\n-Greeting:  Warm, OK.  Not anything super special.\n-Robe:  Robe was FABULOUS!  I'm 5'10\"" and any robe that not only wraps around me with enough to cover me when I sit, and goes below my calves is great.  And plush!!!\n-Slippers:  GREASY!  I mean, who wants to be reminded that someone else has worn the slippers before?  Nasty.  Had to wipe down.\n\nSnack/Water: Good snack, fresh fruit (apples) and water container with oranges/lemons. VERY refreshing.  The hostess (?) did hand me a small bottle of water upon check-in too.  \n\nLocker:  Good.  \nRestroom/Women's Change area:  Restrooms were clean.  The change area was stocked with pre-pasted individually wrapped toothbrushes (GREAT TOUCH!), deodorant, hairspray, and other nice touches.  I don't ever use the hairbrushes the spas provide simply because I'm not sure who's used what and put what where...  I couldn't tell which were clean and which were soiled there.\nShowers:  Small, greasy tile, doors do not offer privacy.  I walked in and saw a woman shaving, and could tell a LOT about her body.  They need to fix that.  They do offer VERY NICE RAZORS!  The shower gel, shampoo were ok.\n\nLounge:  Now this is what has really take away from my joy that day...  The lounge is typically a place where you go to relax before/after the massage.  Typically there will be nice soothing music playing and the vibe encourages whispers/quiet.  NOT SO HERE.  There was NO MUSIC, women were cackling, you could hear a couple of vulgar women hanging out in the \""clothing optional\"" spa talking about the night before...  The seats were OK...  There aren't many so, a few ladies had to sit on regular chairs...  when the therapists come in to get their next client they YELL OUT THE NAME!  It was a stressful environment at the hour and half hour when massage times were up.\n\nMassage:  I don't like to be nickel-and-dimed.  If you're going to charge me $195 for massage, I can decide to take it or not.  But don't charge me $140 and then claim that anything I ask will be extra...  Like - \""do you have any areas you'd like me to concentrate on?\""  I answered, \""Yes, my lower back...\""  the response was \""OK, that'll be an extra $20 for customization...\""  WHAT???  UGH!  I don't like that.\n\nThe quality of the massage wasn't too great either.  I had Karen who basically gave me an oil rub.  I asked for the Swedish.  There were rapid, harsh, jagged movements, and talking.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed.  Unless there are profound changes, I won't be returning.  I'm glad my girlfriends couldn't make it with me.  I would have been thoroughly embarrassed.\n\nSorry Signature."
1,"I took a tour of this Kiwanis Park Rec Center facility yesterday and was blown away by how nice it is! \n\nAs many of the other reviews state, this place is home to a 9,500 square foot gymnasium with \""Robbins Flooring,\"" 15 lighted tennis courts, sand volleyball courts, a fitness room with cardio and strength training equipment, a lap pool / wave pool, conference rooms, locker rooms, and more.  They offer all kinds of activities year-round including sports camps, yoga, pilates, dodgeball, CPR and First Aid classes, and so much more.  The best part? It's extremely affordable at just a few dollars per visit.\n\nThe park across the street is huge and gorgeous... if I lived closer, I'd be there all the time with Minnie!\n\nI am actually hoping to plan some kind of family friendly Yelp event at Kiwanis Park Recreation Center in the near future - stay tuned for details!"
0,Long long long wait in drive thru.  For hard freaking chicken strips.  Overpriced.  Overrated.  Food was either overcooked or under a heat lamp all day.   A waste of a good location they could put a better fast food joint.
0,"I'm being generous here.  I used to frequent XS when it first opened. It set the bar for Vegas clubs. This review is for table and bottle service. Unfortunately I didn't use my people for the reservation and my buddy and his crew used someone who didn't care. $3500 for a tiny booth next to the restrooms.  It's no longer got any class to it.  I've never been somewhere where so much money was being spent and I had my drink knocked so many times.  Half the time it was from a bouncer charging through the crowd without care. I has to dry clean everything and my new JV boots were scuffed beyond repair. I'd advise dressing down for this place. We saw our waitress 4 times for the entire night and she was difficult, unaccommodating, and moody. The place was also packed to the point where a sea of people were swaying through the room and we were literally getting crushed against our booth.  A shame as Encore is still a great hotel."
0,"We are locals and dine at Ferraro's a lot, but we won't be back. The food was good but not the service. We went there with a restaurant.com cert which irritated the server, and the time before we went for their locals promotion only to be treated the same way. When our bill was presented she took the cert and when it was returned to us their was a 3.00 difference same with the locals promotion. She also had charged us for the most expensive glass of wine when we had the less expensive wine. We purchased two glasses at the bar at one price and were charged more at the table for the second glasses. This is the third time we have been treated this way by the same server. If they are going to offer specials they should honor them. We have dined and spent a lot there without discounts there was no reason to do this. We will not be back. Also the 18% gratuity that she added on the second bill was not necessary my daughter works in the industry so we always tip 20 to 25% so she lost out, wrong person to do this to. Never again"
1,"At first I didn't know this resto basically served their food raw and I pretty much ordered dishes that weren't so tasty in my opinion.  My bf had a lasagna which was quite strange (we are used to having our meals cooked). The second time I came with an expert and she told me what to order which was the sandwiches and boyyy were they amazing! Surprisingly filling and had a unique taste! The dessert was great too, I ordered a tiramisu and I was shocked to learn that they did not use  anything non-vegan. I don't understand how they can make a cake without eggs or milk or butter! But it tasted fantastic! I would definitely come back again to eat their sandwiches or pizzas. and also desserts! Service was excellent as well. Very friendly and patient with newbies in a vegan restaurant."
1,"This is my second time here.  It is a low key coffee house in the day and a wine bar in the night.  They have original artwork hanging up and funky chairs that look like you might impale yourself on (see picture) if you were inclined to throw yourself upon one of them -- you know, if you are having one of those depressing, \""i can't take it anymore\"" days.  Anyhow, today I am trying the french toast (see picture).  They serve you home-made bread, 2 large slices and it is not overly sweet.  They also belong to the Belly Bites reward program -- nice touch.  The atmosphere is good to work in while enjoying a nice cup of coffee, latte, etc.  Good music too -- now playing \""Sweet Jane\"" by Lou Reed -  RIP.  Oh, most importantly I forgot to mention the blazing fast internet they have here!"
1,so much stuff!
1,Through our friends staying at the Valley Ho (tee hee!) we had the pleasure of getting a cooking demo/tip sesh with Sean Currid (chef at Valley Ho). Not only was Sean incredibly friendly and helpful but the food was (DUH) phenomenal. \n\nWe had a moz and tomato salad (perfect starter) followed by a kale with white bean side accompanied by some awesome pan made croutons. \n\nUsing some ingredients straight from the stands at the market was a cool way to incorporate local goods (woot buy local!) \n\nThis was a great way to start day two of our trip.... a definite must check out local or tourist alike! \n\n\nOnly criticism: We had reservations but by the time we got there non reservation folks had taken our bags/seats... flipside of that is that the guy who was hosting the event went out of his way to get chairs and ensure we were taken care of...
0,This used to be one of my favorite places until the last time I ordered a submarino and I found a piece of kitchen sponge in my sandwich \nI will try again soon because I have always had good experiences with Fazolis
1,"Sooo good.  \nFirst, our server knew what he was talking about.  And seemed to really have a passion for food.  The fig bread that came with our dinner was soo good.  Me and my friend had to literally force ourselves to stop eating so much of it before our main course. \nI ordered the duck confit and it was very tasty.  Sorry I cant really remember what I had for appetizer and dessert but I remember I had no complaints and was really satisfied.  \n\nAlso the huge dancing frog outside by the waterfall was a nice suprise lol. if youre lucky enough to be sitting by the window you'll know what im talking about."
0,"The food was just OK. Soggy french fries on a greasy cheese steak pattie.  The service was awful, noise, and not helpful for a newcomer to Primantis and Pittsburgh."
0,"This place is a hotspot for hipsters.  I went there a year ago on a date because she was a big fan of Mexican food, as am I.  She ordered a burrito and I got three tacos: 2 fish and 1 carne asada.  We also got the almond horchata.  \n\nThe food was incredibly forgettable.  It wasn't spicy or flavorful in any way.  The presentation was great but who cares if the food is bland.  We were both very disappointed in the food as well as the horchata.  I got the feeling that this place was so busy creating a hipster-friendly environment that they forgot to worry about their food.  \n\nOverall, the place had a cool look, friendly service, and the prices weren't terrible but I'm never going back simply because the food was not that good.  I'll be hitting up Joe's BBQ across the street if I'm ever in the neighborhood again."
1,"My favorite place in Las Vegas hands down. It's where the real folk go to get away from the snobs and wanna be elitists on the strips. \n\nLive entertainment. Cheaper drinks. Zip line. Down to earth people. Who could ask for more, other than a shuttle? Oh wait, there's one of those too!\n\nI don't know why people spend so much to be a part of the fake & classless on the strip because right here on Fremont St is where I ALWAYS want to be."
1,"Burgers, Tacos, Wings, & Beer.. everything you'd expect from a diners, drive-ins, & dives professional!\n\nThe Quad is really starting to shape into an attractive Vegas casino.. as long as you don't see their hotel rooms. haha\nThe addition of Guy Fieri's restaurant, along with Hash House, really steps up the food game in this area of the strip..\n\nFood: Going through the menu, there weren't a lot of fancy-shmancy ingredients or toppings.. just your classic all-American foods assembled into fantastic combinations.\nI decided to go with the Mac+Cheese Bacon Burger.. the ultimate burger throw-up! The patty: very thin but wide, coming out of the burger covering the entire bottom bun.. while the bacon and mac&cheese slightly oozed out on top of the patty. This is the true definition of a \""beautiful mess\"". Very tasty burger, loved the 5-cheese mac&cheese and the simple \""backyard BBQ\"" grilled type of burger. \nThe fries that came with the burger came in 3 types: ridged, curly, and wedges.. awesome!\nWe also ordered the Triple-T fries which was like truffle overload with gouda. We didn't get to try any of the specialty cocktails.. there were many interesting concoctions that we'll definitely try next time.\n\nAmbiance: I'd describe it as an Ed Hardy-themed restaurant.. even the napkins had skulls. haha. A lively restaurant with high, exciting energy. If you're there for lunch, definitely sit outside.. you get the view of the walkway between Harrah's and The Quad, and the front of Caesars. I'm not sure how it is at night but probably crazy loud with Harrahs' Carnival court right next door.\n\nService: Staff was great.. there were two consistent servers continually checking on us. It was a bit of a wait for our food to come out but I give them a little leeway since the restaurant's still brand new.\n\nTips: Don't pass up this place if you're torn on what to eat on the strip. Grab a burger, a few drinks, and enjoy!"
1,"I have been coming here fairly regularly and am normally very happy with the results. Each time I make an appointment, however, they are typically running 30-45 minutes late and it takes FOREVER to complete the appointment. I got my hair colored here one time and was in the place for close to 4 hours.... a little ridiculous. \nFor the most part, all of the students are really friendly and meticulous. The instructors are always roaming around to make sure the students are doing what they should be and they also check the students' work. \nI would recommend going here, just make sure you have a whole day free."
0,Great idea but save yourself $75 and invite yourself over to the house of the buddy who has the nice home theater.  You can bring Chili's takeout since that is about on par with what they serve here.  All told you still save about $30 and you can get by with taking off your shoes and getting really comfortable.
1,"I have been going here for about a year now. It's a pretty nice place. Their staff is really friendly and always happy to answer any question I have or address any comment/complaint. The equipment is maintained well and they have most everything I could ask for. It's is a small gym and the cost is low. I knew that I wasn't getting top quality here, but it's enough to do the job. I would recommend it to anyone who's not incredibly picky and is looking to save some money."
1,"Other than the location (Christown Spectrum Mall), this store is a winner. We buy all our gas here as well. There is always a friendly attendant out by the pumps (not holed up in their little A/C \""office\"") Easy access if you come in from Montebello and you don't have to wade through all the lot lizards and pan handlers usually present out front off of Bethany Home Rd. Store itself is clean and well organized. Staff is usually very helpful and attentive."
0,"Wow... The owner has real guts to call his restaurant as \""Indian restaurant\""... It taste nowhere close to food... Every thing is frozen... Do not recommend..."
0,"What a travesty.  Sysco headquarters.  Ingredients were terrible.  Pizza, if you can call it that, was almost inedible and the kids pasta was worse than a cafeteria.  The interior was corporate and obvious.  They were running a raffle for a bike or something that was bizarre for a restaurant.  Terrible Disney-fied Italian."
1,"Love this place, we have been twice in the last week and will be headed there today.  Sushi taste fresh and ohhh so yummy.  Love the sunset roll."
1,"Probably the nicest vape shop I've been to, really great folks.  Very professional, helpful, and informative.  I just recently found out they have these cards for every 9 bottles of juice you buy you get the 10th bottle free.   My favorite flavores would have to be Snozberry & Vanilla Hazelnut Expresso."
0,"I get all my prescriptions here,  only because its close to my house and also on my way to work, iIt is pretty nasty and worn down in there!!! It's dirty and old, hinky people walking all over the place.  I always feel I have to watch my back in there.  The customer service is nill.  They dont have any type of selection.  But, the pharmacy is ok, my meds are always done and ready on time.  Other then that this place is just weird.  Needs a major make over."
1,"I am a pizza lover.  I actively search out the best pizza.  When I go on vacation, I make sure to visit at least a few of the top rated pizza places in the state I am in.  But Grimaldi's still beats them all out.  Even though I am a pizza enthusiast I am not one who can analyze every ingredient, so I won't be describing the pizza taste in detail here, I just know if it tastes good or not.  I just got back from a trip to Seattle, and visited two places that claimed to be certified from Italy for their pizza, and I would still take Grimaldi's over them.  I think Bianca is way over hyped, and I'm not one who is eager to wait over two hours for my dinner.  Salads are great, pizza is great GO HERE!!!  Only thing I would complain about is that all pizzas are make your own, and adding a couple toppings can run up the bill.  But even just getting pepperoni is amazing."
0,"This place was so disappointing.  I was staying at the red rock resort for business and craving sushi.  \n\nWe were seated right away but then it went downhill from there.  The drink and app orders were taken right away.  It then took at 15 minutes to receive the drinks.   I had asked for warm saki, when she brought the drinks it was cold.  It was then another 10 minutes for a new saki.  \n\nWe ordered the LSD roll (the only good roll we received), Cali roll (meh), veggie tempura roll (so greasy), and some roll with about 15 different things on it that just wasn't very good.\n\nThe waitress was rarely seen and took a long time to receive the the over-inflated check.  If you want good sushi, head somewhere else."
1,"Yum! Definitely a good place for fresh seafood in Phx. Highly recommend! Make reservations and prepare yourself to not see the outside while eating at Salt Cellar. Had the crab cakes for appetizer, halibut and baked lobster as main course. All were excellent and service was an A+!"
1,"I was having Air conditioning problems for the last 2 weeks. Since it has been so hot i think that it put too much strain on the unit.\nI called Bruce's on a recommendation. They came the very next day.\nI did not have an emergancy,i just needed it to run fully well.\n So the tec came the next day , right on time i may add. He had the problem fixed in no time, with just a $69.99 service fee. That was 2 weeks ago and it is still running perfectly. Isn't that what we all want, the Air company to come auickly, fix the problem and not charge too much!\nBruce's is just that!  Thank you!"
1,"James, you were very helpful and your attitude made our dining experience fun!\n\nIt goes against reason to order salmon from a steakhouse, however, I was pleasantly surprised when I did order the salmon due to dietary restrictions. It was one of the most flavorful and well prepared pieces of salmon that I have had, and I frequent fish houses regularly.\n\nThe order was accurate timely and overall tasted great. We had zero wait time however it was after lunch time that we got here. \n\nI look forward to future meals at Logan's Roadhouse!  Again, thank you James for your professional service and fun interaction with our children."
0,what kind of a burger king does not serve Chicken Sandwich!!!! This is like the only burger kind ive been so far that only serves one type of chicken sandwich in two style...crispy or grill...whatever happen to the fish or the orignal chicken sandwich? what a disappointment...
0,"I havent even stepped foot on this property and am only writing my experience of trying to get info. I inquired info for my wedding there. I had a menu in mind and emailed it over. I was told that the chef did not feel comfortable doing it. It was a pretty typical menu, filet and fish with sides, etc and a Chinese food station (typical chinese food nothing crazy). strange, but whatever.  I then asked for menus to look at and the coordinator sent it to me saying that the menus are not extensive and have been this way for the past 8 years. thats a great selling point...not. i tried to set up an appointment to see the place but the coordinator seemed to never be available. \n\nthe coordinator didnt seem to care if i booked there or not. not a feeling you should let your client's feel. there are so many places out there, you should be fighting for business. or maybe even care a little bit more.\n\na friend of mine, her brother got married there a year ago. she ended up doing  A LOT. she had to lay the linens down which is the venue's responsibility (their linens). they would not put centerpieces down or help with lighting some candles. my friend and her husband was there hours before the wedding setting up tables, chairs and linens and stayed after the wedding tearing it down. \n\nfrom what i can tell in photos, it does look beautiful, but the service i have had so far stinks. if i can getting this kind of experience now, what kind am i getting day of my wedding or the days leading up to it?"
1,"Initially booked a room at Golden Gate but they were overbooked and walked us over to Golden Nugget next door. Funny thing is before they walked us they said that they would waive all of the resort fees. When we walked over and asked Golden Nugget front desk to confirm they'd waive the fees, they said they never had resort fees to begin with! Haha. \n\nAs far as the hotel, it's a good place to stay if you have kids! There's a swimming pool in the middle of the casino that the kids can hang out in while the adults gamble or drink on Fremont street. The standard rooms are nice. This particular night we stayed in the Carson Tower and it was somewhat of a long walk to our room since there are so many rooms in the casino. I personally have seen the suites in golden nugget and it's a great place to stay if you're looking to book a night with a bunch of friends."
0,"LuLu's is ok when I'm feeling hungry and don't have much time. I'm glad that they finally changed their bubble tea menu that now allows you to choose options such as the kind of tea, different boba and juices that are available. You can even choose how much or little sweetener that you want in your tea. The food is sub-par. I have found that Dr. Fu's noodles are my go to dish even though the past two times I've ordered there were only five small pieces of chicken throughout the entire dish. So, go and try it but proceed with caution knowing that there are far better options out there for you."
0,"This place is awful! Told the obnoxious attendant I only WANT A BASIC CARWASH 10 TIMES!!! Wanted to sell me \""future\"" services! Pulled out and went somewhere else."
1,"Matt was awesome. They gave me the best quote for our 2014 Honda pilot. They were professional, knowledgeable,  and do awesome work. I made my appointment, dropped the Pilot off, and 2 1/2 hours later they were done! Im pleased with the work they did! Im sending all my peeps his way!"
1,Great atmosphere and food! Service was pretty good too. The selection is interesting but I love trying new things. Love the ambiance. Will go back!
0,"I saw another frozen yogurt shop opening here in Ahwatukee (why were there so few for a while? California has so many and Arizona has so few - makes no sense) and I was hoping they would have tart yogurt like Pink Berry, or at least like MoJo's and lucky me, they did! \n\nI looked on-line before they opened and saw they had a twitter account and on that it said for their grand opening weekend yogurt was buy-one-get-one half off so we all went in on a Saturday afternoon looking for just that. \n\nThey place is very small, but decorated well with green tile and all the yogurt machines are in the walls. Unlike MoJo's, when you come in the door and do it all your self here the yogurt girls want to serve you the samples themselves (for all I know, maybe even the yogurt). We asked about the BOGO and the girl had no idea about so she went to ask her manager. She came out and said the manager would only do it with the coupon so I had to explain that twitter doesn't come with a coupon and their tweet said nothing about a coupon.  So she had to go back to get the manager to intervene.  (Check out their tweet on August 16 at 4:02 pm http://twitter.com/ZwirlYogurt) She argued with me for a while and I understood where she was coming from, she obviously wasn't in charge of the twitter account, but come on. You need to be aware of what's going on with your business. She conceded and said that she could do it for us and to let us know when we were ready and she would personally ring us up. \n\nAt that point we had sampled a couple of flavors here and there waiting for answers and we weren't too impressed. The original tart was bland. I know that's what you would expect, but it's not bland at MoJo's or Pink Berry's. Kind of like the difference of fat free ice cream compared to the real thing (only this is all fat free). I also tried the tart pomegranate and that also tasted like it was missing something. My husband tried a couple too and that alone seemed to satisfy him. I just took a lick off my sample cups and gave the rest to the toddler so he was in heaven so after all that we decided the yogurt just wasn't worth it BOGO or not and we left. Sadly we won't be back. We'll stick with Golden Spoon and when I'm lucky to be close enough to MoJo's, I'll get my fix there. That being said, I hope they do well, I don't want to see any businesses fail."
0,have not been there in a long time...the guy taking the order was in some other world.\nthe amount of pork or chicken on the sandwich has been reduced to almost half.\nthe drinks are watered down. and the prices are up. Me thinks I wont be back there.
0,Playing repulsive music containing words and images that made me want to run from the store. I was told this is what their shoppers like to listen to. Not me. Never again and I'll warn my friends.
0,I got the Oregon Trail and Tater Tots.  Not impressed.  Flavorless Bison Burger.  Mushy Bun.  Overwhelmed by the garlic in the aioli.  And expensive.  Not worth the money or time.
1,"J'adore le pain....et les biscuits....et les gateaux....et les croissants....\n\nGreat French bakery that serves up goodies with a smile.  La Belle Terre offers artisan breads, pastries, and \""real food\"" (quiche, sandwiches, soups) with flair.  On my maiden visit a few days ago, I sampled the \""Normand\"" sandwich (turkey breast, Brie, apple, walnuts) and it was very good.  The bread tasted like it came out of the oven a few hours ago: chewy, soft, yeasty, yum.  I also enjoyed the Baby Rasta, an original chocolate meringue cookie sandwich topped with (vanilla) meringue \""dreadlocks\"".  Magnifique!  For takeaway, I selected a few macarons (blueberry and passion fruit), chocolate chip cookies, and a cranberry roll.  All were gone far too quickly!\n\nI am returning to try the quiche.  :)\n\nIf you haven't already, pay a visit to La Belle Terre.  You'll enter and exit with a smile on your face because how can anyone be sad in a bakery?"
1,A little dirty and could be a little nicer of a place to put the shop in but otherwise - all games were in good condition and playable.  I did enjoy the old school (50's era) pinball machines.  Cultural goldmine and this place will only get more popular in the future.
0,"The ballroom, as the name suggests, provides a grand atmosphere for lunch.  But the food is done by University Dining Services -- the same people that cater meetings and events so badly.  The motto could be:  \""A dorm dining hall without the dorm.\""\n\nThe one joy of the buffet line for me is its Midwestern-ness.  I occasionally see jello salads and ambrosia unlike anything I have ever seen on the West Coast.  Miniature marshmallows!   Fruit salad with... is that mayonnaise?  The salad and dessert recipes recall the Better Homes cookbook circa 1952.  But beyond these culture shocks there is little pleasure to be found.  \n\nIt's expensive for the quality of the food.  The salad bar is tolerable.  The main dishes range from poor to horrible.  The sandwich bar features limp lunchmeats and tasteless bread.  If you like to snicker at such things, apparently the person who writes the buffet cards is often stumped by the exotic ingredients in some dishes.  This leads to platters marked as \""White Soup,\"" \""Spring Salad\"" or my favorite: \""Ethnic Dish.\""\n\nNote that the previous price listed is out of date.  It is now $8.75 for buffet, drink, and dessert."
1,"Great Pizza and Salads. Went here a few weeks ago for girls dinner and had a great time. Would highly suggest it. Also have visited the one in Old Town and great time and food there as well. \n\nTried to heat up the pizza the next day, since I had tons of leftovers and it was disgusting lol not sure what happened.. but good the day of :)"
0,"My girlfriend and I spent three nights at the MGM and had a mixed experience. It took about 45 minutes for them to correct our Priceline reservation. We had paid for two for one buffet, free admission to Studio 54 and two free drinks but they didn't have any record and had to find it (which they did). The person that originally checked us in rushed us out before we had the chance to ask any questions, but the second person we got (after waiting in line again) was great and resolved the issue. \n\nWe then got two shows, KA and David Copperfield. Both were great shows, KA was the best show I've seen anywhere, ever... and David Copperfield was entertaining (but not to the scale of KA). \n\nOur room needed a lot of work. The remotes didn't work, but were replaced after a few hours of waiting. The shower flooded the bathroom and bedroom area (there was no sealer under the curtain) but the front desk was responsive in getting fresh towels up within a few minutes after that happened. \n\nThe lamp in the room on the desk would constantly spark, sometimes randomly and any time you tapped it. The power in the room caused some power issues with my laptop which appeared like it might be causing random surges (which would also explain the lamp issue). We were not able to get a lamp that did not spark during our stay.  Additionally, the wireless only worked the first day we were there (but no discount on the \""resort fee!\"")\n\nCheck out was fast, efficient, and painless. \n\nOverall, the service was excellent, the rooms were poor, and the shows were great. We'll definitely be back for the entertainment, but will be staying somewhere else in the future."
0,It's out of business.  Nuff said
1,Always love coming here... Best pulled pork in town! The creamed corn is amazing! I loved hanging out on the patio today with a great breeze. Mondays are $3 pints and what a great selection of beers. Thanks to Kathy for setting up a great (and very rare) lunch date. Perfect start to a day off!
1,Awesome experience ! Came here on my birthday and really enjoyed the instructor and the awesome vibe here :) everyone was really nice and make me feel comfortable...it's a little scary but they definitely made me feel at ease ! People should definitely make time to come try the indoor skydiving experience !!
0,"Pathetic. $10 just to view Ferraris that are roped off?  They could have done this in a more friendly way, perhaps at least allowing some reasonable viewing from the outside and through the glass.  The Ferrari dealer here in AZ has about the same selection and you can get as close to you want and browse on Sundays when the salesmen are not there.  What a disappointment!"
1,"I had brunch here last Sunday and I would have to say that the Rib-eye steak was awesome. A perfectly cooked medium rare with soup ,appetizer platter and dessert buffet  for around $24 is a pretty awesome deal for me. The service was very good. The meat is most likely not \""PRIME\"" cut but for the price it was delicious. This experience this time around was way better. I would definitely eat here again."
0,"REVIEW IS FOR THE CASINO ONLY\n\nIt was a no win situation for us at the Wynn. The slot machines are money hungry man eaters. The only way that you'll get any money from here is if the machine is asking you for a 4 digit pin. The table games minimum are set pretty high, so if you are a serious gambler... bring your cash flow here."
1,Jill is awesome! Very professional and does a great job! Very easy to make an appointment and location is easy access! I will most certainly go back. Her facility is a comfortable environment and she ensures you're getting exactly what you want without the pressures and up sells of your typical day/med spa.
1,"This is a classy steak house with an expansive menu. Everything is good and the service is top notch. The calamari, chicken, salmon and steaks were all good. The portions are huge, you will be more than full and the best part is that it is not all ala carte. Good bar selection and the coleslaw and twice baked potatos were great, not to mention all the memorabilia. The only drawback to this place was that the tables are real close together and it lacks the intimate dinning experience, but it was really good and I would return for sure."
1,Forget Panda Express!\n\nBeef Roll\nPeanut Sesame Noodle\nFish & Tofu soup (MY FAVORITE) \nDuck - nice mild flavor\nKung Pao Chicken - standard but delicious
0,Very rude people.  My son picked up a snow globe which then broke in his hand. The assistant manager then asked to pay and refused to write an incident report.  Didn't care that we had glass on him.
0,I was truly not impressed with this place. We went there because my husband and daughter said it was good. I ordered the pork carnitas tacos. Son and hubby ordered the ribeye steak tacos and my daughter ordered the tostada paquime   When they say these are street tacos they mean it. Very small with outrageous pricing and not that good of food. If you want small portions that cost alot then this is your place.
0,"We went here for dinner on a Friday night. It was fairly busy. I ordered Chicken Marsala. I'm not sure what I got. The pasta and sauce were cold and the mushrooms were completely uncooked. The chicken was hot but stringy. I also ordered a glass of wine and when check came she charged for a higher priced glass. That irks me to no end.  Husband got Chicken Parm. He liked the chicken. His pasta and sauce were also cold, the sauce bitter. The bread and wine were really good. Usually wine by the glass is not so great. Waitress was nice. We used to eat here all the time and it was really good. About a year ago we got a terrible meal and this was our first and last time back."
0,Do not trust this days in. Note on wall saying no refund after 15 mins but out of site so you don't see and takes that long to drive around to room walk up stairs and see the state of the room. No refund given. Rude and unprofessional. \n\nThey take your money.  You don't get to see the room. I asked for non smoking. All I got was a smoking room. Went back and changed and got another smokers room. Came back and got shown a sign on the wall to the side\n\nOUT OF SITE TILL THEY SHOW YOU NO REFUND AFTER 15 mins.  Do not trust this days in. They stole my money. The room is not worth 58 bucks. It's not worth 30 bucks. Ramada hotel Charlotte airport and conference center and for 10 bucks more it's like going from a dumpster to a royal palace. \n\nTake my word. Don't waste your time or money.  And if you don't believing me ask if you can see a room before paying. And I bet they will refuse cause the photos look nothing like the rooms.  Trust and go elsewhere. I lost money. No refund and I have to wait till the money hits my bank and then I get it back but as I am leaving the USA. Well that will take time.  So don't take my word. If they don't let you see. Go else where. Why would they say 15 mins lose refund. Simple. It's that bad!!!!!!!!!! Unprofessional when owner says go to hell to a customer asking for refund!!  I won't even give it one star if I could but I have to
0,Just walked past and they're closed. Looks like they are out of business and not coming back.  Just fyi
1,"I went to see Rush here, yeah I know its kind of cheesy, but I am a drummer and Neal Pearte is a god.  We had lawn seats and the sound was amazing throughout the show.  I would actually prefer the lawn over the seats, because you are able to stand up and boogie or lay down and streach out when it gets late.  I am going to see the Allman Brothers and Phil Lesh here in about a month and I am really looking forward to visiting Verizon again."
1,"The great thing abotu Red Rock is that it's far enoguh from The Strip to be free of crowds and touristy nonsense. I don't gamble or anything like that, but I do frequent the movies here and, on occasion, the bowling alley. You can usually count on no crowds here. We walked up to Harry Potter 7.0 on opening night and got great seats for four."
0,"I have been stopping in at Sportsman's Fine Wine & Spirits for a couple of years now. The price range of wine was extreme, they had wine that ranged from @ $10.00 a bottle to bottles that cost in my opinion an insane amount not to say they are not worth the insane price it is just the price was insane. But sadly the reason I have given just one star is the store is closed down  yep that is right no longer in business."
0,"This place used to be amazing, but now not even close. Everything used to be fresh and now the new owners use all pre made products that are not even quality. I used to eat her all the time and no longer. Ya maybe they fixed up the place but what they should have done was put that money towards the food the served. We miss the old owners!!"
0,"$325 Valentines Day Disaster! This was supposed to be a special occasion, not just Valentines, but my wife's 50th birthday, a total disaster. 20 min to get waited on, 15 more minutes to get drinks, 1 1/2 hrs to get appetizer and over 2 more hrs to get the rest of the meal which was only 4 courses total. And we took our deserts to go or we might have been there 3 1/2 hrs. When we complained to the Manager Dan, he blamed the kitchen. He came over later, made small talk and offered us a free app next time we come in. Wow! How generous. How about tonight we asked and he said he couldn't do anything. What an insult. We have been coming here for 9 yrs and this is how we're treated? They even ignored my wife's b'day. Incompetent management, clueless owner.\n\nI tried to post this review on Open Table but they refused to post it because it supposedly didn't meet their guidelines. Open Table gets paid by these restaurants so beware of all the positive reviews you read there. They don't seem to censor the positive reviews."
0,"For the first time in my life I was actually left speechless at how poor the customer service was at a business. \n\nFor those who don't know, this Barnes and Noble is in a shopping center with several other shops, including an AJ's grocery store. My brother and I got some coffee and scones from AJ's while our mom was shopping at some of the other shops in the center. We got a text saying to meet her at Barnes and Noble while she was looking for a book. So we were sitting at one of the tables near the entrance, drinking coffee and eating scones quietly while she shopped. There was another gentleman at the table behind us with a grocery bag and a large iced tea from AJ's. All of a sudden, a woman walked up to the guy behind us and said:\n\n\""Excuse me sir, and you two guys can listen to this as well (referring to my brother and me): We sell drinks and snacks at our cafe. Please don't come in here with your outside food and beverages. This is our business. Thank you.\""\n\nThis was all said in a sarcastic, condescending, overly polite tone. The guy behind us started chuckling as his wife approached the table. She had just purchased a few items. I told the guy, \""I guess your business isn't good enough. Should have spent an extra $2 on an iced tea here!\"" We all had a good laugh. \n\nWe met up with our mom, who couldn't find what she was looking for, and went home to order the book on Amazon."
1,"I have eaten at both Nagoya's and frequent both.  This location has much nicer decor and is huge!  But it is always empty, which makes me sad. I hate empty places.\nI fell in love with their garlic edamame from reviews on here, and am so thankful for it! However, I am constantly craving it when it isn't sushi night.\nI am not a sushi snob and eat the americanized rolls and stay away from the 'scary' items. So I may not be the best person to rate sushi!  \nBut Nagoya does my type of rolls well. Their tempura is always fresh (unlike Oyshi which pre cooks their shrimp tempura and lets them sit out until used) and sweet, the way I like it.  Their spicy tuna is spicy without being overbearing. \nI don't feel like they use too much rice in the rolled pieces, but perhaps in the Nigiri they do. One thing that I don't like is that some of their rolls are ---- long and others are -------------- long.  So you expect your next roll to be one size, and next thing you know, you have a monster roll in front of you.  They do offer half rolls, which I need to learn to take advantage of.\n\nMy boyfriend loves their Mango spicy tuna roll, which very few places offer. \n\nWe failed AYCE sushi last night and barely ate our worth as we filled up so fast, but normally we make full advantage of it there!"
1,"OK but not fantastic food-at least in my opinion.  It is basic, quick, non americanized faire.  I would like to see the salsas perked up a bit but doubt that will happen as they havent been changed in years and years."

0,"I consider my foray here to be a complete Yelp letdown.  I arrived at approximately 10 pm and still faced a 2 hour wait to be seated with approximately 10-15 people ahead of me in line.  The reason for the long waits is the limited bar seating.  There are approximately 16 seats and only 6 roasting pans so at any given time, half the bar is eating and half are waiting for the food with each turnover taking approximately 40 minutes.  \n\nOnce seated, there is an additional 30 minute wait for food.  Math check: you've now invested 2.5 hours so it better be some mind-blowing food to overcome the interminable wait times.  Looking around the faces of my fellow diners, it was clear that Oyster Bar did not deliver.  We all looked sullen and grumpy - reasonable given it was past midnight and we were all starving. \n\nIf you want faster sustenance, I recommend getting a bowl of clam chowder.  Even that took about 15 minutes to arrive.  It was nondescript in every way. \n\nI ordered the Palace Pan Roast, with Lobster Shrimp and Crab in a creamy tomato base.   The open cooking system, admittedly, is a decent show and I enjoyed watching the chef make our dishes.  There are steam pots and into them go, in this particular order and at designated times: 1) a pat of butter, 2) your seafood, 3) clam broth, 4) the tomato/cream soup, and 5) a scoop full of crab meat.  John's Gumbo was similar.  First the butter, then vegetables and seafood, clam broth, a dark roux, and a scoop of crab meat. \n\nThe problem is that there is a haphazard timing system.  All the butter goes into all the pots at once.  Then, the chef comes back around for the seafood.  Once the broths and soups go in, he usually takes that opportunity to focus on shucking the bivalves.  It was a  new form of torture, watching your food bubble furiously away, while the chef man-handled a dozen oysters or prepare shrimp cocktail.  Literally, all you wanted to do was reach out and help yourself to the soup and instead the chef spent a quarter of an hour on each fruits de mer plate. \n\nThe wait was certainly not worth it.  The Chef spent so much time on the shucking that I think our dishes over-reduced.   My pan roast was an inch lower in volume than the next item and I knew it was going to be salty.   You get a big soup bowl full of a creamy tomato soup, one scoop of rice, a few shrimps, and lots of crab pieces.  The proportions were so off.  I would have that much soup for a family of four and at least two scoops of rice apiece.  I don't know how anyone could have spooned so much salty soup without anything to soak it up.  John's Gumbo was similar except it tasted like liquified roux.  \n\nWe also saw some unsanitary behavior going on.  The Chef washed the steam pots after emptying their stews into the bowls and left the bowls inches from the pots he was washing, certain to let dish water get into the food.  Not appetizing."
1,"= = = = =  DAILY LUNCH & DINNER BUFFET!  = = = = =\n\nTried this lovely YC's location for the first time today and it was just as expected after having recently dined at three of their four other locations.  This privately held little Valley chain just has everything right.  The restaurant floor plans vary but they're all comfortable, modern dining rooms hosted by cheerful, friendly staffers serving up some serious Buffet!     :-))\n\nFor this visit I started filling the provided bowl with some rolls of sliced beef, white chicken and pork, followed by a sprinkles of Cajon spice blend and also of \""Bangkok.\""  Then I piled in & squished down some of most of the many veggies along the serving line, and lastly added plenty of wheat noodles.\n\nOver at the Mongolian Grill area there are 16 recipes on the overhead sauce menu sign, but each day they also offer a couple of specials on little marker boards above the recipe ingredient tubs.  I deceded to go with the special \""Spicy Panang Curry\"" sauce, for which the recipe had me grab a bowl there and pour in 4 ladles of Panang Curry base, 1 ladle of Garlic Water, 1 of white wine and a squirt of Sesame Oil from a bottle.\n\nAt the grill counter I added some whole peanuts  The chef quickly fried everything up, I sprinkled some fresh, whole Cilantro leaves and Sesame Seeds on top and it all came out tasting TERRIFIC!  I'm posting a photo, but it doesn't do justice to the amount of food sitting there in this feast.  It was LOTS, just leaving me just enough room for a cup of help-yourself Spicy Beef Soup, my favorite of theirs, to which I added some brown rice.\n\nAs a big eater I go for the Large Bowl ($9.93*).  You may opt for unlimited go-backs for a little more money, but there's no need to do that here if you pack your bowl down well as you're loading it up, with the kitchen paper provided.  Non-gluttons will do fine with a small bowl, well packed.  YUM!!     :-))\n\n*  Help-yourself beverages are included and posted prices include sales tax."
1,Staff always friendly.  Food is good and will always be a customer.  Happy hours are excellent.
0,"Frankly, I was not impressed with the Westin Montreal at all. The rooms are okay but the hallway on our floor smelled like stinky gym shoes and even at times, poop. The staff was about 50/50 and some of the concierge/ front desk staff were rude and not helpful. And the hotel bar was absurdly expensive!! I ordered a kir royal, which cost unbeknownst to me, $30!! Seriously? This hotel is mediocre at best."
0,"Meh, I've experienced better, pretty much covers it.\n\nThe young man who brought water and tea didn't know what tea he was serving us. No straws were brought- big peeve of mine. I dislike drinking from cups at restaurants.\n\nThe egg rolls tasted of perfume. Chicken chow mien was ok, $5.95 for M-F lunch special. They never asked if we wanted desert."
1,"Burritos M4, I think an M4 is a machine gun in Modern Warfare 2 which is appropriate because these things are Killer! For food coma enthusiasts I would recommend getting the chicken, or beef or pork, or any of them with guacamole. I had the chicken with black beans and rice. You get 2 toppings of some freshie fresh salsas, like corn, tomato, verde and mango, guac will run you an extra 1.25 but fully worth it. Then they they put sour cream and some white cheese to finish it off, I shit you not the thing was like 4 inches in diameter, wrapped in foil and ready scarffing. You can get some mini hot sauces added as well and they have their own brew and a Martguerita machine. My burrito was $10 with a drink of water since there was enough calories and goodness there already. You start off eating like a burrito but you need a fork and knife about half way deep. The sucker is huge, and I am tellin no lies. All in all a great burrito, great price and made fresh in front of your salivating face!"
1,"I have become a regular here recently. I have not met cooler business owners, especially ones who will go out of their way for customers. If that wasn't enough, the food is great! Water boiled bagels and amazing variations. Plus, this is the only place I can get vegetarian kimchi in a huge jar and/or on my bagel. Enjoy."
1,Food comes in large portions. I like the fact that they leave a coffee pitcher and at water pitcher on the table for quick refills. Service is good. Food is good Breakfast food.
1,"Have gone here for years, through several owners and the food has been great almost every time. Once in a while they get really skimpy on the portions or seem to lower the quality of the ingredients (change of management? ownership?) but maybe people back off and they realize it and return to the good stuff; not sure. Food is great, prices are decent, portions are generous. Staff is hit or miss and usually hanging out with friends or regulars, making it hard to get attention sometimes, but it's part of the atmosphere. In reference to the take-out comments below, we've begun to do that more only because we can't stand the hookah smoke (sorry hookah peeps!) but that fruit smoke does not mix well with food. They'd be well served to create an outdoor area for the smokers and the non-smokers - especially since cigarette smokers join in as well. Unfortunately, the huge indoor area they have is weird and gross, which is probably why there's never anyone in there. All that said, the food here is good so it's definitely worth trying."
0,"i only ordered once from here on a sunday night at about 830\ni live literally about a 2 min walk from the restaurant but was drunk watching the steelers game and wanted something other then pizza. I ordered online and after about an hour and 15 min i finally decided to call and say hey..wheres my food at? keep in mind im a very low maintenance food eater when it  comes to eating out  but...75 min is pretty ridiculous seeing as i could walk there in about 5. never the less...the guy said it was a busy night and my driver was out with my food and he had about 6 orders total...( why he wouldnt deliver to the address closest first is beyond me but o well) he wasnt rude and seemed like a college kid who sorta gave a crap. my food arived about 80 minutes after i ordered and the delivery guy was pretty nice and even apoligized for the wait. the food was hot but the fries and garlic bread were literally drenched and soggy...all in all this is a place that if you are drunk late at night its good, decent prices and decent food. if you are looking for some actual italian food you are better off going to a freakin olive garden and thats not saying much...as well...with my meal i opted out of the side salad but got one anyways...which isnt an issue..but that says something about them paying attention to order details"
1,"Hopefully you are only a coffee addict.  After all, you could have the double duty of caffeine addiction and gambling, and that would be awfully bad.\n\nComing to Perq (I refuse to say the \""the\"" in front), is plenty worth the wait.  You see, your kinda held captive, as it's the only offering of coffee in the hotel.  The line on weekends is 10-20 deep on weekends, so there's no quick fix.\n\nA small bakery selection, and all the regular stuff (espresso, lattes), with one special feature, a Liquor Affogato, and I can only imagine what its like.\n\nCute attire + nice design - no WIFI = 4.0 stars."
0,"cheaper than a pair of chop sticks. \n\nfood wise: I have been to lots of Chinese restaurants in NJ, MA, GA and NY, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. and this one provides food that we call it \""'Chinese food' for Americans\"". Even on that standard, i give it a 1 out of 5.\n\nservice wise: the 5 of us were from out of town for a conference after which we thought we could have some snack food w/ beer back in hotel. therefore, we paid this place a visit. One of my friends is vegetarian so we ordered egg roll for him. we ordered 3 from appetizer menu and one dish. that takes them 30 minutes to make. Then before i left with my takeout, i checked the bag and there were only 2 pairs of chopsticks! I told the woman (mid-age) there we have 5 ppl. and she gave me 2 more pairs. I asked her for one more pair and she said to me \""you don't need chopsticks to eat egg roll,\"" in referring to my vegetarian friend. Out of disgust, i asked her \""does one extra pair gonna cost you anything?\"" and she replied w/ her high pitch voice, \""everything costs money!\"" \n\nI have never been to a restaurant which would argue w/ customers over a pair of chop stick."
0,"I highly recommend you avoid using this location. They are extremely unorganized! They are friendly however only a few attendants know their jobs completely. I have had to use this location for several different things (P.O. Box, mailing letters/boxes, stamps, change of address) none of which were satisfactory."
1,"We just moved from Nashville and was looking for good wings. We had a Wing stop by us and loved it. I found this one by my office and took them home for dinner last night. I thought I was back home. They were amazing! Great flavors. We got garlic parm (my favorite), lemon pepper (my 4 year old) and original hot (everyone's favorite. Try it and you will be disappointed."
0,"DON'T HAVE THIS COMPANY REPLACE YOUR BATTERY IN YOUR IPHONE!!!! I recently asked them to do it and it took 3 hours for something I confirmed takes a few minutes. Furthermore, they charged me $60 to install it when the battery costs just $35. After leaving their shop, I plugged the phone in to charge and it went as far as 13%. I called the shop and all they said was to bring it back - no way! I went to another shop and they confirmed that Installation of an iPhone battery requires that the connector needs to be soldered to the motherboard, and mine was never soldered.\n\nPhones Are Us are a bunch of hacks and scam artists."
1,"Awesome little breakfast place. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a go on a Wednesday morning. \nI got an omelet with bacon, cheese and avocado with a side of hollandaise sauce. \nReminds me a of cute little diner."
1,"First time here. But not the last time.....First off, the wait staff is excellent! Very professional and friendly. He made some recommendations, and we opted for the Pork Belly and She Crab Soup. Both were excellent! She Crab soup was outstanding, with delicious chunks of crab and the cream added was just the right amount. Pork belly....I mean it's PORK BELLY! Thick bacon cut with lentils so it was YUMMY!\n\nMy date got the Scallops and I got the Paella. Both were really good. Her scallops were better than my Paella, but don't get me wrong, the Paella was really good! It's just that I'm spoiled when it comes to Paella. Cafe Ba Ba Reba in my hometown of Chicago and Segovia's in Toronto really ruined it for me when juding Paella! Nonetheless, Global's Paella was good.\n\nThe dessert. OMG! Their Nougat Glace was phenomenal! Very classic French presentation and preparation. It's basically a very light ice cream, but so much better! I'd highly recommend this if you come here!\n\nOverall a wonderful meal!"
0,"We dined here this evening with my daugher's dance studio being located in the same plaza.  We were both super excited to get a Greek place nearby and had waited anxiously since we saw the signage up prior to opening.  It was pretty disappointing, I am sad to say :(\n\nWe had to wait about 5 minutes at the counter to place our order and finally, I think one of the owners, came over to assist us in our order.  We waited almost 40 minutes for one gyro plate and one souvlaki plate although they did bring out soup samples to all the tables which was very thoughtful.  The gyro was nothing to write home about, the meat on the top of the pita was very very crispy, crunchy in fact which oddly enough, added a pleasant texture.  The sauce was standard and was just the right amount.  The rice was a STANDOUT....super fluffy but in need of a little more seasoning.  My husband's souvlaki pita was tasty, the meat was lean, moist and cut in perfect sizes for the wrap.  Fries were standard with a slight sprinkle of parmesan and parsley.\n\nDeco was a little weird...........a map of Manzanillo Mexico in a Greek place was a little weird not to mention the Asian/Chinese art on the tables.  Television was quite loud and obtrusive, maybe a little mood music would be a better choice at night.  The service was really slow, they have been open a couple weeks now so maybe they are still getting the feel for the layout.  It was super clean, a positive for me :)\n\nI may go back in at lunch time perhaps to try out another dish.  I am really hopeful that they are able to maintain and stay open as every other establishment in this corner has closed previously."
0,"On my most recent Vegas trip, I went for a bachelor's party, and Hooters is where they guys wanted to stay. Though I prefer to lodge elsewhere, I didn't want to separate myself from the group, so I took a deep breath, and dived into the place that I was so happy to check OUT of a couple of days later. \n\nMy feeling of dejection began the moment we pulled into the garage. Everything is tightly packed in the garage, so each time we turned a corner to ascend to the next level, I had to close my eyes out of fear of that we'd scrape the car against a pillar, or another vehicle. In the garage, there's an elevator, which takes you to the casino level of the main building. The elevator is as dirty and raggedy as something you'd see in a rundown portion of an old NYC subway station. Unlike many other hotel/casinos, which have adequate ventilation systems, to counter the smoke, this casino floor smelled like a tobacco factory. I will give credit to the check-in staff, however, they were very friendly, and a pleasure to interact with! The rooms were ok, nothing special, but it was clean, no bad smells, and I did have a decent view of the strip (8th floor). It's an older no-frills place, so I wasn't expecting marble floors and stone counter tops, so I was ok with what was there. The only issue that I had inside of the room was the shower. The shower heads have only one pressure setting, and it feels like needles pricking your skin. Otherwise, the accommodations where aligned with the pricing of the facility. \n\nI'd say there's a very low likelihood that I'll ever lodge at Hooters again. For me, it's definitely more worthwhile to spend the extra money and stay someplace directly on the strip, with a higher star rating. For the drunken Las Vegas visitor, who just needs a place to sleep, then this is the place for you. Again, despite my dislike for the place overall, I give kudos to the check-in staff for maintaining customer service competence, regardless of the surroundings."

1,"WOW! You'd never notice this place if you weren't looking for it. I had some family in town and this place is pretty close to where I live, after reading the Yelp reviews we decided to give it a shot and treat ourselves to some deluxe pedicures. The chairs were comfortable and the shop looked and felt clean and taken care of. My pedicure was fantastic, the place was pretty busy but I never felt like I was being rushed. The nail tech took his time and the whole experience from the calf and foot massage to the moisturizing cream was wonderful. Everyone in the salon was very friendly, we were warmly greeted when we walked in, the staff was professional and personable while we were there, and we were sincerely thanked for coming in on our way out.  I will definitely be back!"

0,"The building has a nice rooftop deck, but it's all downhill from there. The seafood was fried in old, spent oil. Coconut shrimp sounded great, but were apparently a frozen product served with sickly-sweet dipping sauce. Their crab cakes tasted like an old lady's shoe, not kidding - the worst I've ever tried - and seafood is supposed to be their specialty. Vegetables were unseasoned and nearly raw. Unbelievably bad. I don't see how a restaurant can open on East Boulevard and expect to make it these days and be so slack, unless the owner is some rich redneck who doesn't care about quality. Hey, at least they have $20 drinks to waste your money on while you listen to tired old 80's rock and roll. Sad. What a weird subculture."
0,"The weirdness of this place begins before you even get out of your car, when you are confronted with parking reserved for pregnant women only!  Then when you enter, you discover a huge restaurant with no customers!  At least that was the case when I was there on this Tuesday at about 11:15 AM.  \n\nTo the right of the entrance there was a counter with an older woman (Pugzie?) standing there behind it, & it looks like where you pay, but it isn't!  Instead, you pay when you order, at another counter way down a wide aisle to the left that has enough line rows roped off for the entrance to the State Fair!\n\nI ordered today's Special, which was a Pastrami Sandwich.  It comes only one way, on fresh but strange swirly bread that has very dark mixed with what I suppose is whole wheat, & some rye seeds in it.  For the Special, you also get a pickle spear & a small cup of not-very-good macaroni salad, & a small mint for dessert.  The pastrami serving was ok, about 1\"" at the highest point, tapering down to zero at the edges of the bread.  That's not generous but Pugzie's here isn't as expensive as Scott's or Chompie's either.\n\nAnother reviewer complained that they thought the restaurant looked dirty.  It looked very clean to me, & there is a pretty courtyard outside with comfortable looking tables & chairs for those who enjoy eating outside.\n\nThe price for this \""Tuesday Special\"" was a reasonable $6.50, & I went back & forth on whether to give the place 2 or 3 Stars.  I didn't enjoy it enough to return for another visit, so I'll settle in at 2, & I guess I'll never know why in the world that woman is standing there.  Weird place!     :-O"
1,"Love the Sunday brunch! Staff keeps the buffet well stocked despite it typically being quite busy. French toast casserole, hash brown casserole, broccoli casserole...oh my! yum yum & yum! Of course, they also have the usual brunch staples as well: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, biscuits & gravy & much much more. My only disappointment were the eggs benedict. Its hard to keep something like that on a buffet line in mass production and have it be delicious, in my opinion. It was 'okay'.  A little on the plain side for me. There is SO much more to choose from, so overall I say... it's fabulous!! (and all for $13.95....what?!)"
0,"I was given a glowing recommendation of this place because of their beef noodle soup, but sadly it was a let down. I appreciate the local joint's attempt, and the price is good, but the soup was too sweet for the style they were selling."
0,"I stayed here with a group of around 10 in a Corner King Suite.\n\nYou'd expect a big suite there to have everything perfect right? NOPE! All the batteries from our remotes were missing, we had no speaker system to hook up our phones into, and the hotel service was extremely slow in responding to our issues despite our multiple reminders.\n\nThe upside is that its a nice modern hotel and its in the center of the vegas strip, so you can easily walk anywhere you want on the strip or if you taxi it won't cost too much. If only Haze was a nightclub worth hitting up while staying there though.."
1,"If you are determined to eat healthy this is the place to get your groceries. Their fruits and vegetables are always really good. For such a small store (maybe about 1/4 the size of a Fry's) Sprouts has a tremendous variety of items. There is a very good selection of organic products and supplements. Like most grocery stores, some items are priced very well and others not so well. \n\nThe staff seems to be helpful and upbeat. There is a decidedly upscale feel to this store. I can't quite put my finger on why but it just seems to attract a different type of customer. \n\nGetting in and out of the parking lot can be a bit of an adventure, especially on weekends. If there is such a thing as a \""fun\"" place to shop for groceries, this is it."
0,"I really don't understand how this place can be held in such high regard.  There isn't a particularly good drink selection, the food is terribly mediocre (the burgers are just terrible), and the bar itself has not a remarkable characteristic in sight.\n\nWhile all that is bad enough, I've always felt that the employees here are tremendously standoffish with anyone under 40, and this is the only place I've been to downtown where they'll chase your party down after you walk in the door.  \n\nWith so many fantastic places in downtown Champaign, the only reason this one hasn't gone out of business has to be the location."

The store manager denied the re-shipping of my package. She said, \""IT IS ILLEGAL TO SHIP WINE.\"" hmm what is wrong with this statement? Its called BAD BUSINESS.\n\nWhy did they ship it in the first place? Take my money and run huh. No reimbursement, no apology, I still have the wine and it needs to get to another location. I called corporate and was promised that my problem would be resolved within 48 hours of my complaint. It's a week later and no resolution, no phone call, and now the lady at corporate is ignoring my messages. Just give me my money back and I'll take my business elsewhere....FOREVER!\n\nThere are many many more details and problems with this story, but I was trying to keep it simple. DO NOT SHIP WITH UPS!!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE, FULL OF LIES, and THEY TREAT YOUR STUFF LIKE CRAP AND STEAL FROM YOU!!!!"
0,"It's got a ways to go. I debated a season pass the good part is they let you try the park out and if you have your receipt you can pay the difference for a season pass. I had $100 worth of cowabunga cash i wanted to use for admission, for some reason they kept ringing up invalid so the cashier had to get her boss who had to get his boss in which we waited a good 15 minutes for someone to fix the situation. I will have to come back to give a proper review but as of today a part of the park isn't open and 2 slides are not up. The green slide is down because its \""too fast\"". Employees were friendly and a few asked \""did we enjoy the park?\"" Which means they really care, however one cashier had no idea how to work the cash register and I ordered nachos which came with the tiniest cup of cheese and if I wanted more it was .75 cents it wasn't even enough for half the chips. Also, there were three icee machines and only one was working (watermelon/pi\u00f1a colada) and none of the soda machines were operational. I think next year I will buy a pass but not this year."
0,I can't believe the pool closes at 8pm during summer time. We have to get the mini bar refrigerator unlocked and I understand that it has a sensor and that we have to pay for whatever we take from the mini bar but they should at least provide a small refrigerator for the guests. Oh wait! They do have refrigerators to offer the guests but they will charge $25/night. I can smell the chlorine coming out of the shower heads also and its way too strong. I've been to one of the best hotels here and I thought that this hotel will be better than the other 4-5 star hotels we stayed at.
1,"I'm giving 4 outta 5 stars. Catfish is the bomb-diggity. Flavorful and non-greasy, fried goodness.\nThey need to work on their customer service and efficiency, big time.\nI called to place a large catfish order to be picked up in a couple hours. Their business phone must've rung 20 times before someone picked up and hurriedly put me through to an order taker. When I showed up on a Friday night to pick up the order, the line inside the store was long, and the service slow and unorganized. 30 minutes later, I walked out with a huge tray of their awesome catfish. I believe somebody dropped the ball and didn't have my order ready.\nThe business reminds me of a Mom and Pop corner grocery, with a meat/butcher department and a take-out counter. Also some tables for those wanting to eat inside. Just don't be put off by some of the riff-raff outside the establishment, and be prepared to wait for your catfish, chicken, wings, and sides.\nIt's worth it."
1,The dark chocolate gelato is amazing! We love going here!
1,"Don't judge me.\n\nI must confess, I thought the cupcake rage was a fad that would fade quickly.  No, strike that; I WANTED the fad the fade quickly.  Most places I tried seemed too focused on making their frosting taste good and not enough on making the cupcake moist and tasty to stand in its own.  In fact, some places had more frosting than cupcake (*cough*Tammie Coe*cough*)!\n\nBring it back over a year ago and I walked into Caked to try their wares.  Frankly, I was not impressed.  It was ok, but Duncan Heins made better.  \n\nFlash forward to last week.  Coming out of Sushi Mon I was hungry for desert (AYCE just isn't the same anymore when it's not AYCE desert...but that's a discussion for another review).  Anyway, we strolled on over to Caked and I was only going to grab one cupcake (I need to watch my figure).  But the smell of sweet treats called to me and my eyes started to get bigger as I looked longingly into the display case.  EYES = O.O     stomach = o\n\nEach was $2.75:\n\n   Red Velvet (x2) - probably my least favorite.  The frosting was light and tasty, but the cupcake left me wanting a bit more flavor.  Not sure whether the frosting just outshone the cupcake or if the cupcake didn't have much flavor.  I'll be back to try again.  :)  \n\n   Carrot cake (x2) - Definitely my family's (and mine) favorite.  REALLY moist and tasty cake.  The frosting was just right: not too heavy and thick like most actual cakes have.  \n\n   DQ (x2) - Basically a chocolate cupcake with vanilla frosting, which is dipped in a chocolate shell like Dairy Queen (hence the name, duh).  Wasn't sure about this one because it seemed so plain, but it had sprinkles to please the kids so we got it.  This ended up being really flavorful.  The cupcake was really moist and chocolatey, but not so rich that you needed to wash every bite down with milk.  The frosting was a bit hard and too sweet for my tastebuds, but the fam didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n   Vanilla - hey, don't judge...it was a request by my daughter.  As usual, I didn't get a bite.  My girl ate it all up (frosting first, of course).\n\n   Mocha (x2) - my pick at the shop and one I will have to be back for.  Had a light, but distinct mocha flavor (duh, right?).  I could honestly do without the frosting because the cupcake could hold it's own.  \n\nAfter pigging out at Sushi Mon and stuffing our faces with cupcakes, we had one leftover DQ that sat in the fridge for 2 days.  Not sure if my wife was hiding it from me...  Anyway, upon discovery by me, I promptly ran to a dark corner of the house and ate it.  To my surprise, it was no less tasty or moist than on that first day.  If that's not a testament, I don't know what is.  I ordered 9, but if I had known the would keep well, I would have gotten a dozen.  \n\nI'm really glad I gave this shop another shot - my original judgement was premature.  Not only did it change my mind about the place, it changed my opinion of cupcakes, in general."
0,"Went to Otto near the gondolas and then later here. Both places we ordered the exact same pizza, margarita with extra basil. The pizza at Otto was much much better. \n\nGrimalidi is a decent pie but just doesn't have the authentic Italian magic which Otto has. The crust was doughy and dry, the cheese tasteless and clumpy, the sauce was fine. Lastly, the ambiance at Otto is much better than Grimaldi.\n\nPrices are the same at both places, so no reason not to check out Otto"
1,"We have eaten there twice now and both time were really good for a sports bar. Good steak sandwiches and french dips, awesome tater tots. Very friendly atmosphere. We definitely will become regulars."
1,I love this little pizza spot! ^_^ I always stop by here after Marquee or when I'm in the strip area and just want a quick bite to eat. The pizza is great and I love the fact that it is hidden. This is pretty much a stop-and-eat place in its own corner. Has a neighborhood feel.
0,"If only there were a 0 star rating option...!\n\nI have the misfortune of having this pub pretty much at the end of my street, and to be honest I've put off having to review it for this long because I really didn't want to have to set foot inside. That may sound a bit pre-judgemental, but let me expand...\n\nAt any given time of the morning/afternoon/evening there will be at least 3 people over the age of 45, with about 6 teeth between them, smoking their 500th cigarette of the day in the doorway whilst already absolutely wasted. Whether they're shouting or singing at whoever happens to be unlucky enough to walk past is really anyone's guess - I think it's been a while since these guys said a sentence that wasn't all slurred into one long indecipherable word.\n\nHow this place ever got a license - it's only just opened a few months ago - I have absolutely no idea. Once you step inside, you immediately understand (and are extremely grateful for) the fact that the windows are frosted. If you've ever watched Shameless and are familiar with their local, then you'll know the sort of thing I'm on about. If you're not, you'd probably be horrified, so I'll spare you the details.\n\nEven if you're an alcoholic at risk of dying if you don't get a drink, and this is the only pub left on earth, don't do it."
0,"We haven't been to Panda Express for years. And now we know why. Not good.  I realize its fast food, but so is Chipotle. Everything is fried chicken with honey/orange flavoring sauce. They did have steamed brown/white rice or vegetables but I didn't go there for the healthy options.  The place was somewhat clean and the staff was somewhat friendly...they put food on our plate. I'll be back in another 5 years--maybe."
0,this place is a complete ripoff! they overcharge didnt give me back my room deposit and dont pay in cash theyll pretend u didnt pay if u lose ur reciept. i stayed for a wk and a half and they treated me worse the longer i stayed im never coming back here again and im telling my friends not to either.
1,"The food is delicious! Laid back atmosphere, easy going staff."
1,Went with a group of friends a couple months back on a Saturday afternoon. The service was spot-on and the food was delicious.  My friends and I enjoyed our time there out on the patio. Will be back to dine again.
0,"I'm already not the biggest fan of the self-serve frozen yogurt fad.  It was unique a little more than a year ago when I first stumbled upon it, but now it's growing tired on me.\n\nThe variety at this Mojo is awful.  There's only a handful of choices, and only three or four of them seem to rotate.  None of them were particularly good on my last visit.  The yogurt itself is also very soft (a common problem at these self-serve places).\n\nI will give the place credit for being very clean.  The topping bar is well stocked with most of the standards.  Mojo has a perfect location at Tempe Market Place.  If you happen to be there and need a treat, stop in.  If you need to drive out of your way, there's an infinite number of places with this concept that I would recommend heading to instead."
1,Amazing attention to detail. Rooms and bed are very comfy. Very clean and pleasant.
0,"Okay, a friend came back to the burgh for a long weekend and after much pleading, begging, and finally, paying me off to take her to this popular Pittsburgh heart clogging, frat boy hangout. If you've had one, you've had every sandwich they sell. They all taste the same, maybe if they salted the fries? Anyway I guess I outgrew the taste of these grease balls. A cold Sam Adams was sitting in front of me and suddenly I thought of it, I can eat healthy by getting turkey, no cheese, fries, or mayo. The waiter looked perplexed after asking him if I could just have turkey with onion, slaw, and tomato. Didn't matter, my sandwich came with fries anyway, guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks. I picked the fries off and gave them to my friend, who by the way does not take Zocor. As I stated before in a quick note, this original Primanti's is basically a tourist trap, Oakland college getaway, and food network geek paradise. I'll go to the primanti full service restaurant on the other side of Crafton where they cook a bit healthier and offer lighter fare."
1,"This place is good to go, went there on a sunny saturday morning, following battling DB's at American Junkie. Had there big breakfast (forgot what it was called), and had a cup of joe and people watched. The food was awesome and the wonderful ladies of Scottsdale are entertaining, it's saturday morning and ladies are rollin in this place like it's a fashion show, to top it off one lady had to reapply her mascara a few times to make sure she was breakfast chic!! Awesome!!"
1,"My friend wanted to take me to breakfast and when she mentioned the place I was thrilled to try it out, being from out of town and judging by the reviews it was worth the try.\n\nThe interior was beautiful. I absolutely loved the decor, it was simple and clean. Even the bathroom was designed well. You order your food first and then seat yourself at a table. Beware of large brunch crowds. \n\nThe food alone was wonderful. The meals were perfection and prepared with the slightest simple yet effective touch. What really drew me to the place was the flight of cold brew, what a genius idea!! We ordered a mexican benedict and a BOMC. The benedict was exactly what I expected, its presentation was great and the chorizo definitely gave off it's mexican flavor. The BOMC was spectacular. The portion is enough for two and easily one of my favorite dishes, even though I haven't tried anything else.....it was just that good. The pork chop was tender and wasn't too seasoned so the pork flavor alone was enlightening. The waffle was a perfect sweetness and my eggs were as good as scrambled eggs can be. The portuguese donut it was paired with was cute, light and powdered with sugar. I didn't have much of it because I was already extremely full from the dish, which was bittersweet. I had a iced latte with vanilla and it was great, smooth and sweet. We also had the flight which will get you to that coffee high. I can't remember the names of the brews but the jalape\u00f1o one was interesting, though wouldn't be my first choice.\n\nI would recommend the restaurant to any breakfast or coffee aficionado. If I'm ever in the area again I would love to stop by. I hope to try some of their other establishments if ever the opportunity arose."
0,"Local business caters to corporate cafeterias; unfortunately training is lacking and food prep is eek! Food has improper storage and easy attraction for varmints. Repetitive menus focus on carbs and starch, not flavor.  A soggy precooked breakfast burrito is hard to swallow in our awesome foodie city. \n\nDisappointing Turnover with grill chefs. There does not appear to be loyal followers here..."
1,"Everyone was right. Zach was awesome. Did a great job, was professional, efficient, educated, and personable.  Not only were they quick to come out to my home but they were really affordable!"
1,Kids love going here. I think it's alright but a better alternative to fast food. I do like their condiment section that you can put on whatever you like. Cookies are yummy.
0,"This was the first time in a couple of years I have been to a Chuck E Cheese. My son was a little too young when I went the first time. Now that he is three I decided to try again. What a great location! They have tons of games at this location. I was not a fan of the pizza the other time I went but this time it tasted really good. I ordered French fries for my kiddo and they gave a lot for just under $2. I really apprecicated their online allergy list. It is very thorough and having a kid with a gluten, dairy and rice allergy makes this very important. The salad bar looked very fresh and next time I will definitely eat that, too. The young man at the front was very polite and nice as was the young lady at the food and prize counter. While I was there, three teenage boys came in and were being a little obnoxious, not even too bad but annoying. The management asked them to leave and handled it very professionally. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I was there as they opened their doors and the games, mainly the tunnels and slide, were very dirty. I would not let my kiddo go in them because they were nasty. To their credit, I have never let him go in those because they are nasty everywhere. They must be hard to clean. Plus, the prize selection was definitely a little lacking. Besides that, love it there and will become a regular customer even though it is a 20 minute drive for me.\n\nEDIT:\nForgot to mention my son got the worst norovirus sickness ever from here and ended up in the ER twice in 2 weeks from lack of fluids. They do not clean the place. BEWARE.\nWe were there on my birthday last Saturday so we could celebrate it as a family. The place was a pit! The worst was the fact that the young man who is supposed to watch the front door, was NEVER at the front door,. A stranger could have walked out the door with my kid. Not that I ever lose sight of my son but one of the nice things about Chuck E Cheese is the system they developed with the stamps at the front door. Well, if no one is manning the front door, they are basically worthless. And again, the place was a pit. It has definitely gone downhill the last dozen times I have gone there."
1,"I've walked by this place many, many times and finally decided to try it. I'm glad I did. They serve fresh chips and salsa. I sat at the bar area and the service was fast. It was actually a little too fast. I got my order before I even got close to finishing the chips and salsa. That's really my only complaint. \n\nThe menu isn't huge and there are no combination plates, but that wasn't a problem. I highly recommend the 3 Steak Tacos plate I got. It comes with rice and beans. \n\nThe waitress/bartender was really nice. I didn't order any alcohol but someone near me was drinking a margarita and it looked big. \n\nIf you're looking for vegan food, they have a vegan menu. \n\nI plan to come back here again sometime."
1,"I didn't eat at BIG mike's. I ate at Milio's. I don't know which location, but it was downtown in amongst the UW campus and State buildings. It was very cold that day, around 19 degrees. So, I will just post my review here. It was good! I had the Pilgrim. What a novel idea, keep the sandwich simple and make it good (why don't you learn something Subway!) I highly recommend Milio's, and I highly recommend very little."
1,"I have been going to Cibo pronounced \""CHEE-boh\""over the years. I love the unique space being located inside a house (restored 1913 bungalow), with wood floors.... gives this place a warm inviting atmosphere. The owners are often there, friendly and staff is cool, helpful..... The outside patio area is beautiful on a nice night, white lights decorate the trees adding to the ambiance and coziness of the place. I always enjoy ordering the antipasto for two to share, a pizza or two, some wine and the amazing marscapone desert. Just wish they were open for dinner on Sunday. Check this place out sometime for a unique experience."
0,"This restaurant is next to the hotel where I was staying.  Even though the Yelp reviews were mostly unfavorable, I went against my fellow yelpers and ordered what I thought would be a safe/no brainer dish - Veggie Spaghetti. \n\nDang..... I don't know what the heck went wrong but it had a horrible \""off\"" taste and I couldn't eat it.  If I hadn't already changed into my comfy clothes kicked back ready to eat, chill and watch tv, I would have taken back the Spaghetti in it's entirety. Dang, it was BAD !  The salad was good, so that was my dinner.  I would NOT go back here.   Minus Stars for the Veggie Spaghetti, 2 starts for the Salad."
0,I would give this 0 stars if I could.  The lady at Las Vegas airport was rude when we purchased round trip tickets.  I asked her why the extra fee and she says it's an airport pick up fee...like really - you're obviously picking everyone up from the airport so build in the fee to the price or take it off!\n\n2nd - we missed the shuttle to the airport on the way home.  They didn't call or anything and I'm sure they were earlier than the arrival time.  We waited 15 minutes until I called them when I found out that they had already left.    This shuttle comes every hour so we couldn't even catch the next one and had to pay for a cab.  It's ridiculous that they have no care for people missing their flights.  A phone call would be great rather than coming super early and then leaving.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and just pay the $$ for a cab.
1,"Every spring I travel with friends and family to Phoenix for 2 weeks of Spring Training.  Every year we go to Hula's two or more times.  Even though we all seemingly have variant tastes in food, we all love coming here.  First, the atmosphere is... (pardon me while a search for the right word).. comfortable!  We always come after dark and sit outside by the fire pit.  Fresh air, dark skies, warm fire all add up to a relaxing cozy home like feel that is just right.  The food is always excellent. It is different.  I would describe it as Southwestern inspired island food.  The service is hit or miss.  We have had some exceptional waitresses and others that have been adequate (fortunately no bad ones yet).  The crowds are a mix including twenty somethings, professionals, tourists and others.  The only true complaint I ever have with Hula's is that the staff is a LOT more attentive towards the twenty somethings than the other customers.  Since I have children in their twenties and am not twenty this can be a problem.  It does get bothersome to be by past by the waitress as she caters/dotes on the table of young people right next to us.\nEven with this age discrimination, I would (and often do) recommend Hula's for its exceptional ambiance and excellent food.  (the ambiance is better than the food)"
1,"The pork belly was my favorite!  Clean and cute inside.  Very interesting to sit and eat bao in a hair salon, but hey! It works and it was fun and yummy!"
1,"Enfin un buffet asiatique qui refl\u00e8te ce qu'on attend d'un buffet asiatique.\nJ'y suis r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement seul ou entre amis selon le temps et les horaires. On y mange \u00e0 sa faim, on y trouve tout ce dont on a envie, soirs et midis. Tout est bon. L'endroit est petit mais le buffet est tr\u00e8s grand. On doit y retourner pour tout essayer !\n\nFinally an asian buffet that corresponds to what you need to find in an asian buffet.\nI'm there regularly alone or with friends depending on time schedules. You eat 'til you're full, everything your heart desires, evening and lunch. Everything is good. The place is small but the buffet is wide. You need to return a second time to try everything !"
0,"After not seeing him for two years, i needed to go back in for a new prescription for my CPAP mask, and I had not seen him for two years because of the office staff. I was told they had new office staff and my experiance would be much better, not the case.  I get to the appointment and I am told it is a 45 minute wait, you take all my information you could not call and tell me, no.  Then I call weeks later to ask about my prescription that they are to fax in,  and they have not done anything.  I talk to the office manager, she assures me they will get it out.  Next week i call and nothing.  Seven weeks later I talked with the office manager and she assures me that they will get it in, well they did finally fax it in.  Now two more weeks later I am waiting on Apria, i call them, they had to call the dr's office because they did not fill the prescirption out correctly.  I am being told next week i should be able to receive the new mask for my CPAP machine.  If the office can not get this correct, I am not willing to risk having him operate on my deviated septum, not worth the risk."
1,This place makes going to court much more pleasant!  I always stop in for a relaxing brunch after stressful mornings at the courthouse :). The police might bring ya down but Chloe's will make you feel better.
0,"I will say the best part about the whole place is the Apple store, biggest one I have seen thus far. However, getting into the place and parking is a nightmare. Either there is too little of it on the sides or most of it is valet parking only. The place is like a little village of shopping. Just too far of a drive and it didn't leave enough impression to make the drive worthwhile. I can't see how this place can be very popular during the summertime seeing as it is outdoor shopping."
1,"So I was visiting Arizona for spring training baseball and pining for a decent meal when we stumbled across Welcome Diner.  This place friggin' rules.  All of the food that our party tried--duck burger, breakfast biscuit, creole breakfast--was off the chain.  And they service beer, which is perfect for a Sunday brunch.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and the service excellent.  They take pride in their craft, and you can see why when you taste the food.  If you're looking for a place to get some soul-nourishing food with a soulful flare, this is the place for you."
1,"Love this coffee bean! Their coffee is delicious, this location is the closest to my house and the service is always good! Place itself is clean and has tables inside and outside to study, chat, and/or just sit & enjoy your cup of coffee. Sometimes they have samples of pastries and/or teas!\n\nDefinitely a fan! :)"
0,"I've had a mocha there before and it was good, as well as bought some loose leaf tea as a gift for a friend. That's not what the 2-star rating is about though. \n\nMy 2 stars are for the fact I stood in line, looked at the menu, and was about to order when I finally saw the (small) sign about no WiFi. Not only was it irritating that I stood and waited in line, it was even more frustrating to realize that I had almost ordered without discovering that first since I was going to try to get some work done. \n\nOnly reason I'd even stopped in was to try to support another local coffee shop (I had already been to GoldBar earlier that day and enjoyed a tasty mocha, PLUS free WiFi)."
0,"I have conflicted feelings about Palazzo's and you will soon see why.  Walking in on a Wed night solo, I was greeted by a very warm (albeit empty) old-school Italian restaurant.  I sat and the beautiful marble bar and immediately the cordial bartender Larry, was at my beck and call.  I ordered a Beefeater Gibson martini up, and he seemed very happy to make one; not too many Gibsons are made these days.\n\nHe was very pleasant and made an excellent drink.  Since the place was pretty empty, the manager was also in the bar chatting about Pittsburgh, sports, politics, and also was very friendly.  I went with my order: started with the escarole with beans, followed by a stand-by spaghetti & meatballs.\n\nThe escarole portion was large and almost like a stew; nicely cooked leaves of escarole mixed with a spicy tomato sauce and a good amount of cannellini beans.  It was excellent, satisfying and could well stand as a meal on its own.  I then proceeded to have the worst pasta I've ever had in a restaurant.  The spaghetti tasted and looked like it came from Chef Boyardee.  The sauce was flavorless and bland.  The noodles were cooked light years beyond al dente and were mushy, starchy and awful.  The meatballs were decent, but the pasta was so bad filet mignon couldn't have saved them.\n\nI really want to give Palazzo's another shot since the service, staff, ambience and escarole were fantastic.  But to screw up such a simple and classic dish I am worried about how some of the more complicated items will come out."
0,"My daughter and I had lunch here.   We had hoped to lunch at Oregano's but the place was packed so we headed over to Picazzo's.  The place was empty but nice inside.  I ordered a half spinach salad and my daughter had a small pizza, with two iced teas.  The food was good, nothing extraordinary but good.  The service was prompt but the waiter's demeanor was chilly.  I was shocked when the bill arrived...almost $60!  I can think of many other places I would prefer to dine if I want to spend that kind of money on lunch.  I will not return."
0,This store is only good if you need like one or 2 items. It is very overpriced and the staff here are very rude. \n\nThey also have a problem with MANY expired items especially in the meat department and Dairy department. Make sure to check the dates. \n\nThe staff are never happy here. So they are always rude and ready to pick a fight over any little thing.
1,"I don't usually like cold coffee drinks. An iced latte once in a while, sure, but otherwise... not my thing. Even during the summer months in Vegas, coffee should be hot and should be served intravenously.\n\nOut at the inaugural Saturday Night Truckstop, and trying some new (to me) food truck yumminess, I needed something to wash it all down. It was hot, I was full, and I had absolutely no idea what I wanted.\n\nTrying to help me decide, they asked me some questions. The technical bits went something like this:\n\n\""Do you like [flavor, flavor, flavor, sweet, savory, this, that, and the other; and what type of milk]?\""\n\n\""Um, yes, yes, not really, no, not too sweet, um, sure, maybe, and nonfat, please?\""\n\n(Forgive the paraphrasing.)\n\nWhat I ended up with was an iced, amaretto-flavored espresso drink (I even took the whipped cream) that I absolutely loved.\n\nNot too sweet, heavy on the coffee without going overboard, and none of that weird syrupy aftertaste that flavored drinks often end with. \n\nI'm a coffee person, no doubt about it, and Grouchy John's has a new fan for sure!"
1,"I'm with Izzy D! \n(Natch.) \nTheir Sweet Thai Chili Wrap is probably one of my favorite things on the menu (when temps are warmer and they're not serving chicken and dumpling soup that is). That sauce... ohhhhhhhhhhh that sauce! I sort of want to ask them for extra so I can dip my delicious wrapped pleasure into a big bowl of the tangy sweet stuff, but I don't want to take too much if it off their hands, nobody else would be able to enjoy it.\n\nI go sans red onion (you can pretty much personalize any wrap, any salad, anyway) which means my whole grain wrap packs fresh greens, tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, chicken (though you can sub tofu), cilantro, probably some things I'm forgetting because ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS THAT SAUCE! It's delicious, and I feel good about eating it. \n\nNow as part of their Power Lunch option, you can get a smaller version of your favorite wrap or salad with a side of fruit for $7. That's sort of insane when you consider it's great fruit. Not lame ass melon, but raspberries, grapes, blackberries, watermelon, pineapple...! \n\nDon't be afraid if you spot the cart and the line looks long, they move quick! I think I waited 6 minutes today for my lunch, not bad when you consider it was prepared fresh to order with stellar ingredients. Add to this the fact that they deliver, and there's really no reason to not give them a whirl sometime soon. \n\nLovely people and flavorful food. \n\nGood food!"
0,"My friends and I shared a room together during Evo 2012 and we stayed at the Roman Towers floor 14. The room was pretty nice, BUT on the day we checked out our friend was removing luggage from the top of the TV Cabinet (pretty tall at least 6 ft) and a DUSTY, OLD, USED CONDOM FELL TO THE GROUND. Idk about you guys, but I was pretty pissed that our room ended up not being cleaned from top to bottom especially with it being Caeser's Palace. \n\nMy boyfriend called the front desk and explained the situation and they said they'd send up a manager. We got a call about 10min later from front desk saying they'd comp a phone call that was made for $62 (boyfriend had called me \""long distance\"" because it was a call from NV to a CA cellphone - was about 5 minutes long). Obviously that wasn't the point and they ended up sending up the manager. So the manager and another random lady showed up, we explained the story and he pretty much confirmed what had happened. To be honest, I don't think anybody believed us because we all LOOK like we're teenagers but I was the youngest in the room and I am 23, so they probably thought we made everything up.\n\nANYWAYS, 10 min passed and we got another phone call from some random person who was obviously given the task to call us and he said they'd comp us $50 for the room. Our other roommate then chimed in explaining how what had happened was a completely violation to cleaning standards, but nothing else happened. On the way down I reminded them that they said they would comp the WHOLE phone call and not just $50, so when we went to the Check-Out desk we explained to the lady our story and she was happy to do it (of course she was, so we wouldn't cause a commotion most likely). We all remained professional during the entire thing and kept telling them it wasn't about the money, it was just disgusting and they acted like it wasn't a big deal.\n\nAnyways, probably never staying here again. Completely grossed out and disappointed with the lack of customer service with this place. Caesar's Palace is going to SH*T."
1,"I am typically wary of both Fox concepts and bigger chain establishments in Old Town, but there are a few I keep in my back pocket for fail-safe night out options. Culinary Dropout is one of them. The experience is always positive, the food is typically satisfactory and the drinks hit the spot.\n\nThe decor at this location is rustic, contemporary and lovely at the same time with a wide open space laced with wood accents. Live music is a nice touch and makes for a decent ambient sound when enjoying drinks with your party. I have really enjoyed the cocktails I've ordered here, which gives me confidence in their bartenders. Happy hour is great time to go with lower prices and decent options. Although I wasn't thrilled with the grill cheese sliders and their rubbery faux-american cheese aftertaste, but the salad of the day hit the spot. I've also had the burrata which was a true indulgence down to the last bite.\n\nThe staff has always been very friendly here whether it's behind the bar or table service. Even I have to admit this Fox concept is executed perfectly and is in my stand-by Old Town rotation."
1,"Vettes and Rods Car Club has a GREAT time at  Rehab Burger Therapy this last Sunday! Awesome food and AWESOME service! We had at least 35 members there and we could not have had a better time! MOST COOL! And - I heard a few friends say \""I think we have found our new favorite place\"" :-) Thanks again for a great time!"
0,"We had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation. In fact, they have yet to call back to confirm or cancel. If they can't get a reservation right, what else would have gone wrong?"
1,"Update: they sell their goods at Mario Batali's Market on Thursdays and fresh52 market on Sundays in Henderson. They don't sell their bread at the location listed above.\n\nThe Skinny: oh my god... white chocolate-cinnamon brioche (5).\n\nBought a white choclate-cinnamon brioche loaf today for $9. I never thought I'd say this but it is worth every penny. The smell of baked cinnamon goodness just wafts within 10 ft of the loaf. It's a lighter brioche than what I'm used to, but still really good.  I also suspect it will make killer French Toast.\n\nAlso got a nice multigrain-cranberry batard for $4 but gave it away to a friend. (Let me tell you, she's a great friend or else I would have kept it for myself). Will have to try this next week."
0,"Was here for Interbike 2009 and I have to say this place needs some serious work.\n\nFew key highlights:\n-Setting up for the show, we were in grave danger of getting run over by fork lifts speeding around the floor at 30 mph--this seemed to happen when we were breaking the show down as well; the workers seem a bit lax in their regard to safety\n-food is HORRIBLE---for example they want $1.75 for a piece of half-rotten fruit and almost $10 for a crappy salad! don't even try! just sneak in your own or escape somewhere with real food\n-services we ordered for the show (including the operation of a keg) did not go over very smoothly.  \n\nthis is just a taste of what you can expect from the Sands convention center.  good luck!"
0,"Pains me to write a bad review for a place that i think can succeed but gets in its own way.  \n\nWe headed here after a trip to the science center. The science center was great fun but our experience here was not very good.  I first ordered the burger which is usually a safe bet.  My waitress comes back and tells me they are out of burgers.  This was 1pm on Monday after the new year mind you.  Then I say I will have the steak sliders, nope out of those too.  Finally settle on Fish and Chips which were ok.  The fish was fresh but was not seasoned at all.  Chips were bag frozen so not much to expect.  Apparently the kitchen was shut down later due to lack running out of food and the place was actually turning away business.  The service was ok but really had to make up for the lack of the kitchens ability.\n\nThis is a bar and should probably stay away from serving food at all.  Judging by the other reviews this is a usual occurrence sadly."
0,"this was the most horrifyingly bad restaurant I have been to in quite a long time.  I was wanting some good Chinese food and was in the Charlotte area, so I checked my geoqupons and checked Yelp (this place got 4 stars) and off we went.  First off, they did not accept the coupon, said it had to be printed out, get with the program and join the 21st Century.  Now let's get to the food, the dumplings were huge sure, but that was just because they were coated in so much dough that the meager fillings were barely able to be found.  The Hunan Beef, described as spicy, was weak with barely a hint of bite and the Cashew Chicken is at best a bit of dishwater with a few nuts thrown in.  The fried rice was flavourless as well, and the only hint that it was even fried were a few sparse bits of egg.  The prices were low but I still felt completely ripped off as it wasted my time to even go there in the first place.  As a final straw, before we left, the waiter mistook my boyfriend's iced tea for water and topped it off accordingly.  Avoid at all costs!"
1,"I have been WAITING to review this place because of all the different opinions on these reviews. I didn't have any food so I can't really comment on that but the drinks were good and strong. People were very nice. Outside was interesting...never seen sand lots in a bar, but the fact that they have an outside bar as well as inside was great! I was there on a UFC fight night so it got pretty busy as it got closer but the bartender was always very attentive and waitresses came to check on us frequently. I didn't get to stay for this epic loud obnoxious DJ or the other bad things that have been said about night time but it looks like this place could be such a good time!"
0,"Sorry, sorry, sorry. \n\nI am sorry I wasted my time! money! and the calories that I took in from this place.  Worst BBQ I have EVER had."
0,Great food. Absolutely shit service. If you come in and order a To-Go about 8 people walk by and look at you like you're and inconvenience. The food is the only aspect of Bachi and Shoyu Ramen keeping it afloat. Only reason I didn't give 1 star is because the guy who finally helped was awesome and made up for it...
1,"Most of the dishes were very good, service was attentive and the portions generous (granted the prices are on the high side, but I still thought it was a good value). I also really liked the ambience and it is a great reason to check out Aria as well. Would return."
0,"Simply not worth the excessive time or the calories. Despite three separate reassurances from our waitress and two managers that a computer glitch was the issue, it took 2 hours for three people to receive some bland sushi (that was not what was ordered - and the spicy tuna roll contained lettuce?!) and the salmon plate. Chopsticks took another 10 minutes.  Each dish finally arrived - in separate 15 minute blocks - and was unremarkable, however, they comped the meal."
1,"Cozy, delicious, and unique, this Oakland gem provides a wonderful retreat behind its curtained doorway.  Not every dish is a winner (chicken is usually a little dry), but the tea selection is great, and certain authentic and westernized specialties alike are as good as it gets in the neighborhood (and in some cases, the city).\n\nRice noodle dishes (like Singapore Noodles and Pad Thai) are especially well executed."
0,"I took my car in for an oil change, their banner advertisement said $39.99. When I pulled up I told the very friendly guy I wanted an oil change and I pointed at the banner. He offered and told me about their  different car wash options, I picked one and I walked inside to pay for it. I was then told my car needs transmission fluid flush, coolant flush, New air and fuel filter and it would be over $300. I explained I'm a single mom on a very tight budget and all I do was the oil change. I went to pay and the girl at the register said to wait and pay after the car is done so I did. What a surprise I got when I went to pay, my total was $78.57. I was charged $54.99 for the oil change. I asked why if the banner says $39.99 and I was told my car has high mileage so I got the high mileage service. That's not what I asked for. I asked for a manager he said, \""I am a manager, I don't know what you want me to do, I even gave you a free car wash\"" and he walked away. NO, he didn't give me a free car wash because I paid $20 for it and I wasn't asking him to give me anything for free. Bottom line is I was charged for something I didn't ask for. The \""manager\"" was not professional and I will not be going back."
0,"I realize that I can quit this gym anytime that I want to do so.  However, they are so close to my house that I probably won't.   I am at my wits' end. The machines are consistently broken.  If it's not the machine itself (heart rate doesn't work, incline doesn't work, etc) then it's the headphone jack.  I have written emails.  I have spoken with the staff.  I have suggested ways that they can be more proactive in finding and labeling the broken machines...to no avail.  I am not exaggerating when I say that on four out of five visits, I have to go to at least three machines before I find one that works.  I report the broken machines, but I have no idea what they do about it - I rarely see out of order signs on the machines, yet I find broken machines consistently.  They got some new treadmills and I was excited about those until I realized, halfway through my run, that the incline didn't work on the machine that I was using.  Their cusotmer service is really bad - the people that work the front desk really seem as though they don't want to be there.  I am also disappointed in their holiday hours.  On Thanksgiving, my schedule requires that I exercise in the wee hours.  Mountainside typically opens at 4:30, so I assumed I'd have no problem.  Good thing I called because I found out that they don't open until 6:00.  I know that I am not the only person who wants to exercise early on Thanksgiving whether it's for travel, to clean the house or prepare food.  I wish they were opening earlier.  Now I have to run outside in the dark."

1,"5 stars! period! \nMy husband worked for the family years ago and besides being great people, they make authentic great (from scratch) food. \nThe pistachio passion is the most amazing dessert ever made! \nFerraro's offers great food, wine, service, and ambiance!\nThis is a regular choice for our nights out..."
1,"This is my favorite spot in Vegas to stop for breakfast.  I'm the kind of guy who likes breakfast food at all times of the day.  Their skillets here are amazing, and so are their pancakes!  Highly recommend!"
0,"I am appalled at how this place operates. The staff are rude (the woman who sets appointments gave me attitude on several occasions), the doctors come and go because they don't give them enough time to see and get to know patients. They book infant and toddler well-visits 10 minutes apart. That is not enough time to check out an infant and administer shots. I would give \""0\"" stars if I could. I have been trying for 3 weeks to get my 18 month in for a well visit and shots. They have NO appointments and cannot accommodate around my working mom schedule."
1,Good solid Denny's. I ordered the skillet and stayed full front it a long time plus it tasted good. Can't beat the prices for a sitdown meal. I'll be in agin. Thanks for taking great care of me.
0,"Sometimes it is the little things that finally throw you over the edge.  I have been back to Gertrude's a few times since my first review--I got a membership because I knew I would have lots of opportunities to take folks to the Chuhily exhibit.   As a result because Gertrude's is there I have ended up eating there.  Each time the experience has been impacted either by food that is bland to terrible to service that is so off and on.\n\nToday however has given me the resolve to not go back.  Had breakfast there with a friend--ordered hot tea--they had no honey--for me not having honey is like for some folks not being able to drink black coffee.  Okay I get it sometimes you run out of things.  breakfast was two eggs, bacon, one slice of toast and six or seven fingerling potatoes--price point $12--not exactly inexpensive, but i get that the setting is gorgeous--food was okay--neither the best or worst eggs I have ever had\n\nbut here comes the little thing----they charge for jam for your one piece of toast.  they brought two tablespoons in a little bowl and for the privilege of having a little something sweet on your toast, you are charged a $1.50--but it's homemade they said--\n\nIn theory--I would hope that a restaurant at the level Gertrude's is attempting to be--that everything is homemade.  This charge offended my sensibilities of fairness and reasonableness--it can only be a slippery slope down to charging if you want silverware to eat with.  \n\nThat's it--I won't be back--for a $12 breakfast, a tablespoon of jam (which is what was used)  should not have a surcharge--\n\nI am not sure what the Gertrude's business model is, but I hope there is some planning ahead when there are no longer stunning works of art to  lure people in--I can't imagines locals coming to this restaurant--just because---there are so many other choices--some also with views, who have the sense that good business model for exceptional dining experiences is not to nickle and dime people."
1,"Went in here for my Christmas Eve pampering.... always the best way to celebrate the end of the hectic season before celebrating with family.  \n\nI called earlier in the day to ask about an offer I had received in the mail, I wanted to upgrade to Shellac and they were knowledgeable and prompt.  When I came in later in the day, they were able to get me in right away.  The salon is spacious and clean.  \n\nThe pedicure was lovely.  I had the hot stone, which included a nice long leg massage followed by a leg massage with the hot stones.  The whole time (and into my manicure) they had a hot herbal wrap on my shoulders.  The manicure was great, and Theresa was very personable and kind.  On my last session under the UV of the process, she took of the heat wrap and gave a nice shoulder massage.  Once cured I received an equally as nice and long hand and arm massage.\n\nThe ladies here are very polite and welcoming.  The prices are also fair for what you receive.\n\nI grabbed a business card on my way out, and when I looked at it later I realized that it was the punch card I had heard about prior to coming.  I wish I would of looked at it sooner because I did not get my punch for my visit due to the fact I didn't see the back while there.\n\nI wish this newly opened salon the best of luck, if they keep up what I saw on my visit, I am sure they will do just nicely!!"
0,"Undrinkable coffee. Sorry to the hipster doofus crowd but the coffee is horrible. made the mistake of listening to others who suggested this place while taking some friends from Europe through the downtown redevelopment. None of us was willing to take a second sip, our first tasting so awful. Better to grab your coffee at Lux instead."
1,"It's no surprise that the bagels and shmears are wonderful. This location is the closest to my parents' house and my mom loves Einstein Bros. bagels, so this is where we visit. The interior is very nice and cozy. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I love the selection of bagel flavors (Everything, Potato, Asiago Cheese, and Sesame Seed are some of my favorites) and the reduced-fat whipped shmears are so, so good (Sun-Dried Tomato Basil, Garlic & Herb, Onion & Chive are my go-to flavors, but they're really all delicious except the Smoked Salmon). During the fall, they have delicious offerings like Pumpkin Walnut Gourmet Bagel and Pumpkin Shmear (YUM!), adding to the fun. Get the baker's dozen box, which comes with two shmears, and freeze some for later. Also, don't forget to ask for a stamp card and have them slice your bagels!"
0,"After hearing awesome stories about Pisces from a few of our friends, my boyfriend and I decided to check it out one night before we hit the bars. We came in and immediately commented to each other on the cute atmosphere, even more excited than we were originally. I ignored the hostess' flat tone when she asked us if we'd rather sit at the bar or in the lounge, having worked at a late night restaurant for two years of my life, I figured she was just tired and gave her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOur server bounded over to the table almost immediately after we sat and asked us if we were ready to order. We explained it was our first time and that we'd be ready to order a couple of drinks and some appetizers soon. When he came back, we ordered beers and he asked to see our ID's. My boyfriend's ID is pretty old and beat up, so we were cool with it when the server said he'd have to ask a manager if he could accept it. He came back a few minutes later and asked my boyfriend what his zodiac sign was. My boyfriend is no astrological guru and accidentally answered with the wrong sign and the server simply narrowed his eyes and said \""I don't know...\"" My boyfriend (who also has worked in the restaurant industry) then told him that if he didn't feel comfortable serving him alcohol, it was okay, but that I'd still like my drink and then  we'd be ready to order food. The server said okay and left the table. Ten minutes went by. Fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes later, we saw him - changed into a t-shirt with his backpack on, waving to his coworkers and walking out the door. REALLY? Since when has it ever been okay to leave work when you've still got a table?!\n\nThankfully the bartender was very cool and took over the table after I went over and explained to him what happened. He was also much more attentive and quicker when we asked him for anything (this is while also waiting on another bigger party and having a full bar of patrons). I don't know if we'll ever be back. It's a shame because the sushi was delicious. I don't remember what we got because I was so annoyed at the nerve of our original server. If we ever do come back, I'll be sure to let the disinterested hostess know we'd like to sit at the bar, NOT the lounge."
1,"I tried Cozymel's on a recommendation from my parents.  Living in San Diego, I never go to chain Mexican places - there are just too many other places to try.  I was expecting Cozymel's to be okay, nothing great.\n\nWe went for lunch, and I was happy to see a whole page of lunch specials for about $8.  Usually, an enchilada combo plate could set you back close to $15 at a Mexican chain.  Not here (during lunch at least).  \n\nI ordered the taco salad with black beans instead of meat.  It came in an enormous flour tortilla shell - tostada style.  It was excellent.  The ingredients were very fresh, and it had just the right amount of everything. The chips and salsa were also fresh and delicious - no gigantic pieces of cilantro in the salsa, yay!  \n\nOthers ordered a seared chicken burrito, tortilla soup, and an enchilada plate.  Everyone thought everything was surprisingly good.  The service was fine.\n\nSign up for their email list and get $10 off.  Cozymel's is great if you're looking for something reasonably priced and healthy-ish (depending on what you order) instead of stuffing yourself at a Vegas buffet!  I'd return."
0,"I've lived at San Antigua for about 3 years.  My apartment is not updated, which is fine with me, because it saves me money (and I work only a mile away, so the commute is fantastic).  They did put in all new appliances about a year and a half ago, but I think they are the lowest quality possible. The original microwave had a tag inside that it was manufactured in August 1993 and it was not pretty.  But it was clean and it worked better than my new one.  Same with the other appliances. I would have been happy if they had replaced the washer with a efficient front loader!  But the one I have doesn't even have a delicate cycle.  I wash all of my work clothes in lingerie bags (I have about 10 now) to protect them from the beating they would get in that washer.\n\nI have had a few maintenance requests, and they have usually come right away.  I noticed comments about the water being off, and the water was off often.  Once until late at night (when the notice said during the day only) and there was no way to get an update.  It was very inconvenient and annoying, but that is resolved.\n\nMy main issue is with the office staff, which is what is driving me to write today.  The two main ladies I've interacted with in the last year (I think one is gone now, but her replacement is no better) are not helpful at all.  Last year I was going to be away for 4 weeks and I asked about how I could handle my rent and my water bill payment (I was to return on the 4th of the month).  I could pay my rent ahead of time (not ideal, but that's fine). But for the water bill, I should pay more than the amount I paid for that month to make sure I covered next months, because they charge you a late fee if you are one day late.  I think they should have worked with me for the $20 water bill that would have been 5 days late.  Their attitude was \""too bad\"" and they weren't even nice about it.\n\nThere used to be a drop box that I would drop my rent into on my way to work on the first, but that is now gone. You can pay your rent online now, but the water bill doesn't show up on your account until sometime on the 1st usually after 10 am (I can usually pay at lunch time and its there).  Today however, I went to pay a little after noon, and the water bill did not yet show up on my account.  I called the office and was told they were having trouble with getting the water bill online. I could bring a check in to the office.  I pointed out they don't have a drop box anymore.  She pretty much said I would be charged a late fee if I didn't pay today.  So I hope I remember to go back online to pay that portion and I have to hope it is there to pay. Its like I get a 6 - 8 (if I'm lucky) hour window to pay the rent and I better make it work with my life.  It is very frustrating and annoying.  I've never had issues like this any where else I have lived.\n\nLast year I probably would have rated them 4 stars, but with my issues with the office staff, I am down to 2.  And I'm considering moving out when my lease is up in the fall."
1,"Crazy busy airport with long wait times at security. Plan ahead! \n\nThat said however, this is a pretty decent airport. There are plenty of food options with both local and national chains, there are cute stores to buy Southwest themed treats, toys and take-homes, and the walkways (once you're through security) are pretty wide. I also found the bathrooms to be tidy as well as the carpets in the gate areas. I know that's odd to mention but dirty carpets really gross me out and this airport seems to be nicer than many I've been to recently. Go PHX!"
0,"I moved into this apartment complex a little over 2 months ago. It is a brand new complex and has many common amenities. It is situated on the border of Scottsdale and Paradise Valley. \n\nI am giving it 2 stars for the below unbiased reasons:\n\n1) Every unit has a built in fan in the bathroom that cannot ever be turned off. The fan runs 24/7 and flashes a green light. While some may not find it to be a big disturbance, I personally find it difficult to sleep well with the fan perpetually on without wearing earplugs. Broadstone Alliance has turned it on so that it can pursue Leed certification. (Leed certification can lead to tax savings for corporations). The manager claims it benefits tenants due to the constant clean air, you can be the judge. \n\n2) You can hear noise in hallways vividly. While noise insulation between units appears decent, because there is a slit under unit doors, if you are unfortunate to have neighbors who will speak loudly in the hallways and odd hours, it is audible. \n \n3) Apartments monthly rent can be for example $1299 for a studio, $1500+ for a 1bdrm and you must have renter's insurance. (keep in mind the area, this is not NYC)\n\n4) If you want to break the lease the manager has stated that it will be 2 months rent plus any incentives you received at lease signing. Apply that to the sample apartment rents.  $2600 and $3000+. I was not offered any negation room to break the lease.  \n\nIt is up to you to decide whether it is worth the price. At such high prices I would expect the corporation to have enough decency to leave the fan in the bathroom off for the benefit of it's occupants sense of calm and quiet and treat tenants with more understanding when people are uncomfortable and require lease breaks."
1,"This place is incredible! I love the movie theater with it's rocking leather seats. The theater also offers box seats that move in sequence to the movie, I have not tried those yet but plan to soon. It also offers balcony seats for patrons 21 or older where you may order drinks throughout the movie or maybe you just want to be served lunch or dinner. \n   They also offer a bowling alley and arcade room. Now my favorite places of all, The Cone where they serve homemade ice cream daily and the 347 Grill. The rib-bye steak at the Grill is the best I ever had and is only half the price as the Steak House inside the Casino! Just amazing food! A really amazing place!"

0,"on Thursday the 15th of August at approximately 8:30 pm I placed an order of about a dozen burgers for my pee wee football team and I was short on my order, ..I guess counting burgers isn't a part of customer service now at days, maybe a little basic math course should be included in the hiring process?"
0,"Well, my love affair has sadly ended.  Sorry for the delay on this update.  We went back about a month ago, and just had such a disappointing experience.   The wait staff, as always, was excellent- so I'll still rave about that.  But the food?  It just wasn't as mouth-wateringly delicious as it was before.  And to be truthful, it was actually not good.  Not good at all.    I ordered my Pork Ragout again (I had seriously had dreams about this dish since our last visit).  It was very salty.  Like, horribly salty.  My wife ordered the beef shoulder everyone raved about and couldn't even eat one bite without gagging.   Not sure if the regular chef was out sick, or what the heck happened.... but it was bad enough, that I don't think we'll be returning.  Sorry Salty Sow- but we're better off as friends."
1,"This place was so much fun!  The band was absolutely amazing.  The ONLY reason they didn't get a 5th star, was because I asked the hostess a few days beforehand if there was dancing, and she said \""yes, the band is awesome and they move the tables out so people can dance.\""  The band WAS definitely amazing, but everyone kind of just stood there and my wife wanted to dance on her bday.  Other than that.... awesome!"
1,"Now first off, you must throw out your notion of what a buffet is where you come from.  This is not one of those places where you pile as many peel and eat shrimps on your place, while you madly pile drive past hungry sharp elbowed grandmas who are horning in on the freshly cooked oysters, meanwhile you're blithely ignoring the nasty look the staff is giving you as you try to balance three plates at once.\n\nNo, this is a place you go and get a little bit gussied up.  You're entering some strange Miyazaki buffet wonderland styled by Gourmet Magazine.  You are still surrounded by tourists, but you are all equally awed by the presentation & effort put forth at the buffet tables.  \n\nI spent a lot of time looking around for discounts, and figured that that any discounts came with a lot of effort, so just suck it up and pay full price for it.  I recommend coming for lunch, which will make it $25 ish per person.  Yowsa, right?  But then again, this is high end food, in a high end casino, in high end Las Vegas.  You are going to hand your wallet over to the nice cashier & smile pretty when she thanks you.\n\nEverything I tried was at the very least quite tasty, if not amazing.  And I give kudos for the dessert area.  Most buffets I ignore everything but soft serve.  Crappy ice cream, but there is a something about it....I digress, I am a food snob when it comes to dessert.  I from the SF Bay Area, we know ALL about dessert.  A little pretty presentation will not disguise ineptitude.  But I got none of that here, all the desserts tried were tasty!\n\nBig plus, Steve Wynn, a recently converted vegan, went on campaign to veganize all his properties.  As a result, every food place has a lot more vegan options (if not an entire separate vegan menu that you can request).  At every buffet station there were posted discrete notices reminding you that you are always free to ask the staff to accommodate any food change requests (although presumably in moderation).  I removed 1 star only because the omelet staff person convinced my vegan that egg beaters were vegan.  So, you vegans out there be sure to double check your food if you don't want to be bummed!  Oh right, vegan alfredo sauce kicked serious butt!"
1,"\""OMG! I see tall hot Asian guy!\""\n\""Let's follow him!\""\n\""OKKKKK!!!\""\n\""Go talk to him. He looks like he'll dance.\""\n\""No. I'm scared...\""\n\nOut of all the guys there, we found one that stuck out, but we were too wimpy to get him to dance. Epic fail. =(\n\nThis place is a lot less crowded than Tao and the music is just as good, with 3 seperate rooms for the folks with different taste. The main dance floor is mainstream hiphop and a bit of house mix. A few repeats here and there, but it got me goin.\n\nEvery so often, the cocktails waitresses will walk by with mixed shots for \""free\"". Free, meaning take a shot for a tip. I think that's clever and a lot cheaper than buying at the bar. The shots are usually girly drinks though, like Sex On The Beach or Hurricanes.\n\nOh, and did anyone call for a stripper pole?? There's a platform stage with 2. ;) Get creative."
0,"Go to the dudes, because the lady who I had to deal with seemed to be very uninterested in helping me.

Pretty much dessert.\n\nIce Cream Buffet was awesome! Lots of great toppings.\n\nI loved all the little desserts.\n\nSo, I'd pass on this buffet and spend the $40 on a good steak somewhere else."
1,I have been going to Dr Owen for over 20 years now & he is the best chiropractor in Vegas. he really connects & knows his patients. He takes great care of them as well. I would refer Dr Owen to EVERYBODY
1,"Great value for consistently good food.  I keep getting the pulled pork sandwich. Need to try something else. They also have a wide range of sides, many of which are home made and done well. The place runs like a clock."
1,"By far my favorite theater and a world better than the UltraStar in Suprise.  I am also a fan of Harkins and choose them over AMC every time possible.  The ONLY thing that they really have to stay on top of is the roving packs of RUDE noisy teens that think the movie theater is the place to show how smart (read obnoxious) they are.  \n\nSeriously, you let people act like that and you will run off people with lots more disposable income that will go elsewhere.  Please keep the quality high, and manage the atmosphere.  You have a good thing here, but stay watchful for whether or not Harkins keeps it good."
1,"I enjoyed my stay at the Westin. From the moment I got here, the service is exceptional. Location and atmosphere was great. Family friendly place especially with their pool area. There was a waterslide going into the activity pool. The other pool was open to everyone but seemed like adults were there. They let you check out putters for their putting green, basketball for their full court, ping pong stuff, and more. They has events going on and had a beach to paddle board or pedal boat or kayak. Lots of fun in the resort itself - restaurant was okay and wish they had more options. Great stay if you want to getaway from the strip scene. We were able to go to the village at the lake, drove to lake mead, and visit around the area."
0,"The service at this location was great, until one of the servers managed to incorporate throwing up in into a conversation while I was nursing a hangover. Never a good idea to talk throwing up to a customer that is eating.duh!! This conversation led to more inappropriate words from the employee until he finally left....grrrrr!!!\n\nHad the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.95 ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Can't stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer. Should have just had the chicken and waffle, lesson learned."
0,"High priced FROZEN food......\nThe only possitive part of our visit was the nice waiter. No AC only a floor fan by the salsa bar. \nThe food quality was awful.  Home made fries, NOPE actually frozen (also not cooked correctly). \nFish Frozen! Carne asada, no flavor. \n2 quesadillas, 5 tacos and an order of asada fries total bill $48. \nBest part, everyone in our party got sick.\nDON'T WASTE YOU'RE TIME OR MONEY....."
0,"Awful. Just plain awful. I was born and raised in Las Vegas, and am still a local and I was extremely disappointed. The service was not great, and for $16 I expected to have a MUCH better tasting carne asada burrito. The burrito was cold, the carne asada was dry, the beans tasted like they came from a can, and there was barely any cheese. Everyone in my group was local, and we all agreed that the food was terrible. The chips and salsa also taste store bought and stale. Don't waste your money. I would have thought that with an owner living in town, the quality control would have been better."
0,"I've eaten at a few celebrity-owned restaurants that were amazing (Carne Vino in Vegas, Cafe Atlantico in DC), but Mesa was not one of them.  Based on my experiences, I have decided that the best way to tell if a Celebrity Chef's restaurant is going to be any good or not is how much the restaurant relies on the celeb's name rather than the food to get people in the door.\n\nMy friend and I walked into Mesa for our last summer lunch together and were immediately assaulted by a shrine to Flay behind the hostess stand.  You can buy his books, chutneys, spice rubs, and probably posters in the restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant didn't get much better.  As we were lead to our table, we walked past the open kitchen where the chef manning the grill was cooking burger after burger and piling them up off to one side.  Made to order, eh?  The table we were seated at was so close to another couple that I could have bumped the other lady with my elbow if I wasn't careful.  I know Mesa isn't an intimate date restaurant or anything, but I felt uncomfortable having the conversation I wanted to have with my friend there.\n\nOur waiter had to crawl out of Flay's butt to bring us the day's specials.  \""Do you know Bobby Flay?  Did you choose Mesa because of Mr. Flay?  Do you watch Bobby on the food network?\"" he simpered as he held the menu upside down in front of us.  His appetizer recommendation was good though.  The Queso Fundido was yummy.  As were the ($16) margaritas.  I was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; I could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12.\n\nMy biggest complaint about Mesa, and the reason I only give it one star, is the seasoning.  I get that southwestern spice, chilis and rubs are Flay's thing, but there's something to be said for subtlety.  I ordered a lamb cobb salad because I really like lamb and thought that sounded delicious.  Too bad I couldn't taste my lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  I love lamb because it tastes good.  Why go against that?  About halfway through my salad when I had pretty much decided I had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around the lip of my plate.  He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by the spices as I was.\n\nWe quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about the meal) who brought the plate, still with bug, to our waiter.  He came and apologized, soon the floor manager came to apologize, but she did it in the rudest way I can imagine.  \""Why didn't you say anything when I came by earlier?\"" she demanded.  \""Because a bug hadn't crawled out of my salad yet...\"" I replied.  Then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable.  I get it.  Produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that.  The right thing to do is say I'm so sorry and leave it at that.\n\nFunny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying the meal earlier, I said \""It's ok,\"" which is about how I felt.  She shot me the angriest look and stalked off instead of caring to find out why I wasn't happy.\n\nMy salad was comped, and I got a free creme brulee that was \""ok.\""  Maybe the dinner is better, but I will not go back to Mesa to find out."
0,Never again!\n\nWe were not able to order ANY food for the drive thru never took my order.  Me and the lady behind me had to back out after sitting for 13 minutes!!!\n\nShould have known after trying to go here 2 other times which were unsuccessful as well.  NEVER AGAIN and it's only a matter of time before this location is shut down.  what a shame.
1,This place was really good as far as buffets go. My made to order omelet was delicious. The service was good too.
1,"Two words Henderson Special. It has wings, pizza and salad for a very reasonable price. The wings are crisp and juicy, the sauce perfectly seasoned. The pizza is greasy and flimsy. The salad crisp and fresh. This is my favorite place for date night. I wish they delivered, but every time I call the driver isn't working :-( Service is slow, but who cares, give me my wings and leave me alone. It's as close to perfection as any sports bar will ever get in my life."
0,"This used to be one of my favorite places to go for sushi since it is relatively close to my house and the sushi was pretty good. I didn't go for quite a few months, and when I went back something happened. It was not as good as before. The rolls were much sloppier than I remember. The baked rolls had so much mayo on them they were damn near inedible.\n\nI did enjoy a couple of the rolls still, the \""what the heck\"" rolls jump to mind, but overall it was not a good meal. On top of that, the bill was about $75 for 2 ppl, no alcohol, and we left hungry due to not being able to eat half the food. Of course it wasn't noticed that we didn't eat our food, but that was expected with the comically bad service.\n\nI'm done with this place. I'll have to venture out to one of the other thousands of sushi places around town next time."
1,"The prices on the menu outside almost scared me off, but they were just dinner specials. I ended up getting the canons burg burger, being a fan of buffalo sauce and bleu cheese. It was the best bleu cheese burger I've had in my life. And the fries- they give you so many fries, you have to dig out your burger from under them. All for a price of about $11. I was very impressed, will recommend to friends, and plan to come back."
1,Our AC went out at 5 pm today (day after a holiday).  I called our home warranty and they said it could be as late as Thursday before anyone could come out.  They called Cool Blew and there was a technician at my house in less than 15 minutes.  From the call to the Home warranty company until the job was completed was less than an hour.  Darrell was really kind and did an amazing job.  Now I dont have to worry about getting a hotel so we dont cook tonight!  Thank you Darrell and Cool Blew!
0,"This was my second time here, the service was dismal both times. We went in for the appealing happy hour, however we were not even offered a menu. \n\nCrystal the bartender appears to me miserable with her job. From a business prospective it doesn't make too much sense not to refill Customer's glasses. Putters management should be embarrassed by the service offered at their establishment. The DMV offers quicker, more friendly service.  \n\nAfter having an empty beer glass for 20 minutes I decided that it was time to cash out go to a bar that appreciates having Customers"
1,"Just tried this very new place in downtown Mesa. If I had to sum it up in one word, I would say it was great. I would also add that this is another great place on main street that I have tried. Go to downtown Mesa, there are some great places! Support your locals!\n\nAnyway on with the review...\n\nService was very friendly and informative. Since we had never been there before we had a lot of questions and the staff patiently answered them all. The staff refilled our drinks and delivered our food and picked up our empties! Definitely not your average picnic!\n\nMy wife had the Pressed Roast Beef and she loved it. She was willing to give me a bite and I concur. Creamy horseradish, lettuce, lots of roast beef and provolone cheese on a crispy baguette. Yum.\nI had the Prosciutto and Fix Jam, sounds weird but tastes great! Light on the fig jam, but everything else was so good too.  Plenty of food on both sandwiches you will not go away hungry!\n\nI have to say that the highlight of my meal was the blue cheese coleslaw. Next time just give me a quart of that spicy, blue cheese goodness and a fork!\n\nAtmosphere is nice and comfy, even if it is a little small. Hey it's new! Squeeze into this place for a great sandwich and side, you will not be disappointed!"
1,"Sooo...I finally score the conference in Vegas, 5 days four nights.  Bride is at home, just me and some co-workers and.......I chose to stay here.  Go figure.  Look, if you haven't been to Vegas and you want the 'experience', go stay on the strip.  I have before, it's a blast, never dull and rarely cheap.  But if you are here to work, want someplace that is clean, predictable, shuts down at night, offers a great value for breakfast and dinner AND is still within government per diem, then this is the place.  Clean, friendly, easy to get to from the airport and easy to get to the strip.  Complimentary shuttle access to both as well.  Rooms were spacious and the Neutrogena soaps and shampoos are a nice clean touch.  Hotel shuttle takes you to two shopping centers and Manadalay Bay on the strip, would be nice if it dropped at a more central location, but the strip is always and interesting walk at any time of day.  Nothing really within walking distance for eating if miss the complimentary food or want something different, but plenty within a few minutes drive.  Or you can do what we did and leave at 7:30am and come back at 11:30 and find your sustenance in the midst of the barrage of neon, noise and plasma.  Anyway, clean, comfortable, predicatble:  three things Vegas is not and nice to come home to at the end of the day."
0,"Not sure why people like this place, the food here tasted like gross canned food.Yuck. If u wanna serve me seafood pasta, please make sure that it does not stink. The spaghetti ordered by my husband seemed like Canned pasta sauce and boiled   Spaghetti. The quantity of food, my god! wow who eats that much food! It might be the worst Italian food I have ever had."
0,"You can get better food at Denny's. And I don't even really like Denny's much.\n\nOnly good part of this buffet is the omlet guy. He's fun to watch, and the omlets are good."
1,I LOVE Rays !!!\n\nWhen ever I'm in Phx this is my first stop. I always get the pizza and wing special. Large pizza and 20 wings.\n\nThey have the best wings in valley !!!
1,"We are in Las Vegas on a family vacation. Having two children with celiac disease,most of our vacations are in a hotel or condo with a kitchen so I can cook for the boys. Before we arrived I did some research and found lazy joes. I knew we would be safe since there is no gluten in the friers. Home run!!!! Amazing! The kids haven't had onion rings or mozzarella sticks in 6 years. The fry was light and not greasy. The owner and the staff were so knowledgeable and so helpful. We have a new Vegas favorite! And, my husband who can eat gluten loves to indulge in fish and chips. He loved lazy joes fish and chips. It was gluten deprivation, it was plain delicious. Good times."
1,Upscale version of YCs.  Better seasonings and sauces available (Yay for Curry!).  As a vegetarian it is harder to pack all the veggies in your TINY bowl here as compared to YCs though. The drink specials are AWESOME!
1,"For 9 $ I had half chicken, salad, rice and an insane amount of fries. It's a good option for not too much money"
0,"Must have been a very off night for this place... Walked in and told them it was our first time in- we live in the neighborhood and were looking forward to giving this place a try- super sarcastic hostess says, \""yeah we are pretty awesome\"". Umm ok. So we asked for table of 5 plus a high chair, took them about 10 minutes to figure out they couldn't seat us for at least an hour, hostess was so rude- said they don't normally seat parties of more than 4 (what!?). Walked out front to find three empty 4-top tables, walked back in to hostess and asked if they could push two together and she told me that's not their policy and she would have to ask a manager- even more attitude from her now- I let her know I would like to speak to the manager at this point. He turns out to be even less help than her. We explained we lived up the street etc, he seems like he could care less. Just a side note here- we are a clean cut married couple- dressed casual but nice- late twenties with a beautiful little blondie baby and we literally live two seconds from here. So bummed at how lame this place turned out to be. Won't be back. Last thing- we decided to eat at ha humble pie instead, turned out to be happy hour still and we were seated right away either amazing service as usual and great food."
0,"My friend and were guest at the MGM,we checked in Thursday and stayed until Sunday. Friday we went to the wet republic were my friends purse was taken,we spent about 3 hours filling reports etc...my friend needed to buy new makeup because it was in the purse,when she went to buy new makeup she told a lade that worked at the MGM that her credit card was canceled because her purse was taken, we received a phone call that we need to check out of the hotel because they assumed we had no method of payment .We went to talk to the people at the check out desk to ask why they would check us out with out talking to us ,all they said was basically to bad for us. We payed for our stay in cash ,it was not a problem to do so .THe people at the hotel were os no help to help us find the purse, all they car about is them self,and if we had no cash we would of been out on street,everything was in the purse ATM cards create cards etc.... This is just not write the security at the hotel dropped the ball at the pool, and then they want to kick us out!!!! I will never stay at the MGM.\nAlso they over crowd there clubs, service sucks,and you can't even get water, they make you buy it for$6 a bottle, it's so hot water should free!!"
0,"Wack... Luckily I got 10% off for checking in... Rice was hard, Carne Asada tacos tasted kind of old"
1,"Awesome experience here. Chocolate chip pancakes were great, homemade muffin fantastic and amazing service. Waitress offered to grab us to-go drinks and food was out within 10 minutes of ordering (even with the restaurant full). Great dinner feel and exceptional service. Highly recommend."
0,"After eating at Mad Dogs, my only comment is: \n\nUgh, Chicago-style hotdogs, or Madison-style shitdogs?"
0,"Don't go here. The food came out cold and was way overpriced. Cheaper and tastier meals are everywhere in Vegas, so don't give this place another thought. I would suggest going to Panda Express for a more authentic experience. Yes, Panda Express = More Authentic Experience.\n\nFor a city filled with Asian gamblers, it was odd to see no other Asian person dinning at an Asian restaurant (always a big negative in my book). Maybe their frequent game play has given then enough comps to dine elsewhere, so I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt as far a demographically biased portion of my rating goes.\n\nI ordered the prix fixe menu where the main course was braised sea bass. The sea bass was more boiled than braised. It was texturally unappealing and had no flavor. The greens that accompanied it were overcooked and essentially dead. \n\nI really should have just gone to the food court...."
1,Awesome service right off the bat. The food is fresh and served quickly. Very accommodating staff for when speciality meals are requested. Really nice 1/2 off happy hour too. One of my favorite spots!!
0,"eeew. It started with a cranky waiter who told me that if I wanted to know the specials, then I should have read them on the board. The food was downhill from there. The entire place smelled like fried onions."
1,"Delicious food! The concierge at the Ritz Carlton told us about this place. I had the hangar steak and it didn't disappoint! If you want French with generous proportions, you need to try this restaurant."
0,"Not as good as it was when it opened.  When the Cosmo first opened the menu was much more reasonable, and the food was awesome.  We just ate there this last weekend, and the menu prices have increased dramatically and it is less of a pizza and pasta place than it used to be.  Also, the prices were dramatically higher."
0,"Whatever happened to the great service at this location?!?!?!\n\nI remember before it was rebuilt, they had a stellar drive-thru service. So good that Dave Thomas (rest his soul) came to visit. \n\nEver since the new one was built, you've got long lines inside and out. The cashiers don't really know what they're doing half the time. That's when a manager should step in. 2 registers and usually only one will be open. Another ridiculous thing is that they don't have \""self serve\"" drink fountains (I don't think at any location). There's barely enough room to stand at the register to wait for a refill. The food is sloppy. A lot of times the order is wrong. It seems like the drive-thru has priority. Oh yeah, I remember when they came out with the \""new fries\"" that they were guaranteed hot. That rarely happens.\n\nI actually like the \""new\"" burgers at the Wendys' locations but this place is the pits!\n\nDAVE THOMAS IS SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE, FRANCHISE OWNERS!\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
0,"Hey, go there like 2am and you most likely see the guy outside with some girl,who was sitting on a stool. Went in to get a hotdog. Right, they were dark in color and all wrinkled . Nice deal 1/4 lb.hotdog and chips too bad it was more like 1/4 lbeef jerky and chips. I walked out with nothing and went over to Timbers. I won't take a chance going there to get something fresh."
0,"I am sorry to have to give the Original Fish Market a 2 rating, I could of given it a 3-4 but the service was pretty sad! We sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room. We waited too long for the waiter to initially great us, and there may have only been 5-10 diners in the entire restaurant, so this is the main reason for a 2, hopefully it's a rarity because the food was pretty good. I had the Cod sandwich , it was hot and tasty, probably one of the better fish sandwiches I've had. So it disappoints me to dole out a 2 but service is important!"
1,"There are a limited amount of rides in Vegas, so beggars can't be choosers when it comes to getting your coaster kicks.  Speed the Ride is at the Sahara Hotel on the extreme north end of the \""Strip\"" near the Stratosphere.  \n\nThe coaster is 60-second super speed thrill ride that includes one loop and a Superman style vertical ascent at the end.  It then reverses at top speed and you get the loop one more time.  The speed of the ride is the best part, in which you go 0-60 in about 2 seconds for a hard left turn into the loop.  When you think it is going to slow down, it instead begins to move faster as you climb up the ascent for a 2-second weightless fall.  The return is just as jostling and fun...that is if you are into speed rides such as this.\n\nThe cost is $10 a ride and $8 for a repeat, or $20 for an all day pass.  If you sign up for a player's card you get a discount coupon off the all day pass.  It pretty much run's into the night so you can go almost anytime before 10-11pm."
1,"$50 a night to stay in a super nice, clean, new room really rocked. Then there was the awesome morning sun lighting up the mountainscape. So the rest of the hotel reviews are spot on. There is this matter of the smokey smell, sketchy clientele, and a $75 security deposit they place on your credit card and supposedly refund you in the future. \nWhenever someone does this I am forced to take pictures of my hotel room when I check out to prove its condition, an annoyance.\nI would stay here again."
1,"Nothing I can add that hasn't already been said in the many reviews left previously, but wanted to share my 5 stars. KA was an amazing, immersing show. I believe this is the only Cirque show in Vegas with a distinct story line. \n\nWe got a discount on the tickets since we were staying at the MGM. \n\nI loved it so much I bought a shirt at the gift shop :)"
1,"Wow what a Buffet, excellent choice and variety of Sushi\nas well as every other Asian dish you could want. I have already been 4 times, \nM-F lunch price is $9.95 how can you go wrong"
1,"Yanni's is one of our favorite restaurants.  Also, the owner Yanni is always helpful.  My personal favorite dish is the Lamb Gyro Salad.  It comes with warm pita great that is always delicious.\n\nI am looking forward to trying more dishes there soon."
1,I've been here a many times now for coffee and a breakfast sandwichs. The staff is very friendly and the store has a great eclectic vibe.\n\nThe food has always been great and I didn't find it bland like some previous posters. I'm not sure what they ordered but everything I've tried has hit the spot. Even their spicy food is well done. Their pepper filled Dragon Slayer breakfast sandwich hits the spot... spicy but not so much you can't taste the rest of the ingredients.\n\nSo far I've only hung out here in the morning but heard it's a fun place to be in the evening as well.
1,"Discovered this place with my mom, it will definitely be one of our favorites! 100% vegetarian, awesome service, and close to my mother's house, not too expensive as well."
0,I'd score them with no stars if I could...These people are crooks...buying back cars from manufacturer and selling them as if nothing is wrong..All cars on their lot has a Branded title. ..or salvage lemon buy back ..get are passing off as A ok though really???? Shady place..buyers beware...unless u want to pay too much for a piece if sh*t god bless u.....please look up what branded title means. .......do not go there. ..again unless u want to pay yoo much for a branded title car
1,"The place is conveniently next to the gym. Great place if you are looking to drop off a lot of stuff\nI popped in one day and decided to find out how much they charged and wow.. Very cheap.  I didn't see any reviews so I only dropped off two of my dress shirts.  The gal there told me to come back the next day after 3pm.  FAST.  I came back and my shirts were clean and pressed.  Nothing wrong with any of my shirts.  I asked her if they did the pressing themselves, but they said that it was sent off to another place.  For the price, I didn't care.\n  \nSide note, they do alterations as well"
0,"My wife and I were really looking forward to trying out this restaurant and yesterday we were severely disappointed.\n\nWe came Friday around 130PM for lunch.  Got seated no problem, great.  Staff were very courteous and that was in line with a 5 star hotel.\n\nThe wait was terrible.  They were not understaffed as there were always servers available, but our server came around about once every fifteen minutes.  From the time we sat down to our first bite took about 30 minutes.\n\nThe food was average and overpriced for what we received.  It tasted fine but not much better than our usual nice restaurants, but at 50% the price premium.  The juice my wife ordered was the deal breaker.  9 dollars for a glass of watered down orange juice, and it was super sour (you'd think a 5 star hotel's restaurant would pick out nicer oranges.)\n\nAll in all, maybe the Sunday brunch would have been better.  But I would not visit again based on the service and value at this restaurant."
0,"Congratulations OnTrac, you were the business with service so terrible that it finally pushed me over the edge and got me to register an account on here. If there was a zero stars option this company truly deserves it. Like numerous reviews on here, my order was marked as out for delivery and then never showed up. When the package didn't show up by the service commitment time of 8PM, I contacted OnTrac support and was assured that the package was still out for delivery and would still be arriving on my doorstep any minute. Two hours passed and I decided to call again only to find out that delivery was never even attempted and that the package had been rescheduled for the next day. No compensation from OnTrac was offered. \n\nIf you ever see OnTrac as the company responsible for shipping an order you placed on Amazon, cancel it."
1,"THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED\n\nAnd it's a real shame. I would order from Pizza Amier at least once a month, despite the occasional rude interaction with whoever answered their phone. A note in their window says they will reopen at a new location in the future, but no date or time frame is listed."
0,"It's so funny...these people take the time to post the menu for each day online...and then don't have it.   We planned all week to eat Osso Bucco on Saturday, and then they don't have it!  Someone forgot to heat it up...that's what they said!   Service?  Ugh.  Food?  How would I know?  they couldn't come up with my entree!\n\nNow we're down to 2699 OTHER Italian restaurants in this town to try..."
0,"Nothing but a place that steals your money.  First, it took so long for a simple order to ship/arrive that the patient died (really).  Trying to get these now-useless items returned was an email and phone nightmare.  The products were eventually picked up and, as of this date (6 months after the return), still no credit.\n\nI used to get dozens of emails and banner ads.  After the sole my money, zip.  This simply indicates we are looking at a deliberate case of consumer fraud/theft.\n\nStay away!"
1,"I barely come here, maybe twice a year. There's no need to...since home cooked Filipino food is so much better...and there are wayyyy better choices out there than \""Filipino fast food.\""  When I do come here, Jollibee doesn't disappoint.  The chicken is great with gravy and white rice.  You can't go wrong with the Filipino spaghetti. It's a different take on your traditional spaghetti, it is sweet with hot dogs.  To top off the meal the peach mango pie is a real treat.  Don't forget to take a picture with the bee!"
0,"Service was ok.  Food was like rating at Dennys.  I was referred to this restaurant by the valet at LVH.  I should have known...  Ordered a steak with veggies.  Steak was flat. No seasoning.  I had to dump a lot of salt to make it passable.  a ribeye steak.  Vegetables were frozen, microwaved....even  a soda was $3.00. Do yourself a favor.  Go to Dennys, it would be less expensive and better."
1,I had my first experience here last Friday night. The service and food was excellent. Things started out a bit shaky as they had a very loud wedding party in the dining room and I was concerned it would ruin the evening. Luckily they left about 20 minutes after our arrival and the rest of the night was perfect.\nI am a fan and I will go again!
1,"Heaven's Best was recommended to us by our realtor.  I called today and was able to get my carpet cleaned today.  Darnell was our guy.  He was nice, courteous, and informative.  I highly recommend Heaven's Best and Darnell.  We're leaving Las Vegas, but I have already looked the company up in our new location to be.  I will be using this company again for sure."
1,"Four levels of M & M goodness.  There is something for everyone to choose from here.  Clothing, cooking utensils, office supplies, nick knacks bulk candies and so much more.  I did end up purchasing a small amount of the bulk candies and it was pretty expensive.  Half a small bag was 9 bucks.  All the same flavors and colors you could find in any grocery store I will avoid purchasing them here again.  The other items however were very reasonably priced in my opinion.  I bought a set of measuring cups for 6 dollars.  Spent about an hour just looking at all of the merchandise.  They do have cashiers on every level so they lines are not to long."
0,I have nothing nice to say.....spend your dollars somewhere else...sorry TAO
0,"5/5 for the donuts. \n\n1/5 for service.\nI just left this place. I got off of work at 5:30pm. It was a long day full of crap so on my way home I decided to stop by and get some donuts. Everything went good up until, I started walking out. I found this to be very unprofessional. As I was walking out the guy that helped me said to the girl that was after me that he was glad to see her smiling and that most people don't smile anymore. She then went along and said, \""yeah, I noticed that. I always smile.\"" I seriously wanted to turn around and say something but I chose not to. I don't know if this guy expected all females to flirt with his a** but I certainly didn't go along with it. I may not have been super excited while I picked out my damn donuts, but there was no need to go on talking about me to the next customer. This idiot doesn't know what I may have been through this day. I hope management sees this and informs his employees to keep their damn mouths shut next time a quiet, customer walks in."
0,"I was just expecting so much better. So, so much better. I honestly can't remember much about the experience except that I think I got fish tacos that were ok, my husbands chile relleno was pretty good but the big thing was the rice that came with it. It was AWFUL. He called it \""hotel rice.\"" Cheap, bland rice. It had color, so I think it was supposed to be flavored but, alas, it tasted like nothing. It was a lot of money for mediocre food. There are a lot of places you can spend too much money on food on the strip -- don't do it here."
0,"One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. We were seated right away and were so excited about the \""20 dollars all you can east sushi\"", considering we were in Vegas and wanted to spend money on alcohol and gambling I figured the cheaper the dinner is the better, well in this case you get what you pay for, which is 20 dollar sushi. The rice was dry and would get stuck between my teeth when I would chew. Out waiter was either extremely high or completely wasted, took him over an hour and a half to bring our food out. Just a total mess, in this case I should have spent a little extra and gone to \""sushi roku\"" and had a decent meal. Blegh!"
0,Recently returned from a 3 day stay at Orleans.  I was very dissappointed in the dense smoke level in the casino.  Previously the casino was fairly smoke free with lots of room between machines.  They must have added more slots and the smoke level is terrible everywhere.\nI locked myself out of my room... while walking with security guard to open it... I mentioned the smoke level.  He agreed... it has gotten worse this year.  Despite free comp rooms... I will probably not return. I also noted that the food quality and service in the coffee shop has fallen down significantly.  This used to be a great coffee shop where the prime rib and steaks were great.  No more!  Guess I will have to find a new favorite place to stay in L V!!!
0,"Being a resident of Scottsdale, I try to give all local restaurants & bars a chance. I was incredibly disappointed with The Mint's menu prices and items. We ordered their sizzled shrimp (7 to be exact) which soaked in a dish of sauce, this dish could have been much better had they added rice to this twelve dollar item which would probably cost them little to nothing to add. Instead, you have to pay for a tiny side of rice. The sliders were an asian slider which was soaked in a rice bun. The meat on this \""slider\"" was full of gristle and had tons of lettuce. Last, we were still starving so we ordered dessert. LOL - Let me tell you, we ordered their goat cheese wonton. When they say, \""wonton\"" they mean ONE! The wonton was the size of a quarter and that was it! If this place wants to strive during the week, they need to add a great HH menu and put more food on their dishes. A huge disappointment!!"
1,"I have been going to Nora's on Flamingo for almost 20 years, it is the best. Period."
0,"Wanted to give this place a try and see if it was any good. As Las Vegas is known for many chefs that open restruants he on the strip or in one of the major casinos. \nWell this on is next to the Quad by the Linqs and the new high roller.\nOnce we sat down and got our service it was below average at best. Server we had was not very accommodating and seems like the attitude was coming.\nI ordered the off the hook burger it was oil and sloppy.\nMy other party ordered the Mac and Cheese burger this one was dry and had no flavor at all.\nA side of Mac and Cheese for my baby, ate one bite and didn't want it. Other kid places that have mac and cheese he love, and this is suppose to be good?\nNot good for kids! No kids menu is offered at this place. too expensive to order for a kid or child and not worth it. \nFemale server was not helpful as I stated earlier. I ordered iced tea and I had to ask for a refill and it took forever to come back with that refill. \nI've ate at many burger places and other have not even disappointed like this one.\nAt lease if the service was superior like it should of been anyways.  at least my rating on this establishment  would of been better than a one starer. \nBut a double whammy killed it on the head!!!!!"
0,Good but have had better.....one thing my wife and I did not like is no garnish on burger.   Gotta ask for lettuce tomato pickles onion....really?  My first time there probably last due to 25.00 tab and no offer of toppings.
0,"The only awesome thing about this place is the fact that it's only across the street from the hard rock hotel and casino, where we were planning to attend a beer festival. \n\nWe found this place on amazon local and thought it was a seemingly good deal relative to the photos and amenities promised on the website. Well yeah, the web site played it up far too much for what we got. \n\nThe exterior of the hotel looked awful( as if it were neglected) , our room had random dings and cracks in the walls. The decor and theme would have made it look cool if they actually kept up with regular repair and cleaning. They seemed to have lied on their website because there was no mini bar or poolside bar (etc) which is frustrating. \n\nService and \""rules\"" were probably the most frustrating aspect of our stay at this hotel. They didn't allow for us to check in until 4 pm, although we wanted to check in at noon and accepted the early check in fee; first we were told come in at noon, then we were told that nothing would be available since they were \""booked\"" up the previous night.\nExcuse me, but we made a reservation, accepted the fee, why can't you get on top of your customer service and make sure to get the room cleaned ASAP if we were willing to pay the fee? It's pretty interesting not being able to check in until 4 yet the check out time is no later than 11 am (Which also pretty lame). Also It just didn't seem to make sense to to me that if they were so booked and busy... Shouldn't they at least be able to afford and keep up with repair..?\n\nLastly, the one cool thing that we thought would make our stay better was the pool and hammocks outside - it seemed like a nice place to unwind. However we were really in shock that the pool closed exactly at 9 pm... What kind of crap is that? The apartment complexes back home in Cali had their pools open until 10pm, but for a hotel \""resort\"" in Vegas - LAS VEGAS -to close at 9pm?! Ridiculous. \n\n\nIf you're thinking about staying here... Don't, the pictures and website give it waaaayyyy too much credit it doesn't deserve."
0,I really don't like giving bad reviews and I've had my fair share of delicious and really bad tasting pho. Today I came here with my family and ordered a pho chin (brisket) and my mom got the seafood pho... my goodness I might as well have gotten noodles in a bowl of plain water. The broth was disappointingly bland even with sriracha and hoysen sauce... we seriously had to reach for the salt. The noodles were kinds hard... Maybe it was an off day for them but I probably won't be back
1,"Would have never found this restaurant if it hadn't been for Groupon!  What a gem hidden in North Las Vegas.  I'm very puzzled by the reviews that didn't have a good experience because ours was nothing but positive from the service to the food!  Maybe you should have asked to speak with the owner so your problems could have been rectified?  Anyway, we live in North Las Vegas and will definitely put Mezzo Italian Bistro on our favorite list.  How nice to have a place to sip a glass wine, eat wonderful pasta, and just relax, all within 5 minutes of home!  We loved the calamari which was so tender, and the fettucini and white clam sauce was terrific!  We ate on the patio and the whole experience was wonderful!"
0,"This place is overrated. The service was extremely slow and the waitress never asked us how our food was. I got the jambon croissant with ham and side salad. The salad tasted like someone dipped the lettuce in a pepper shaker. I'm a pretty big foodie, was excited to eat here and ended up being extremely disappointed."
0,"My Friend whom I was dining with got very sick from his burger, mine was okay. I do not know if the server is extremely new but she couldn't tell us what was good or what the specials were. When asked she responded that \""I don't eat here\"" 'nuff said."
1,"I had take out tonight from Sahara's and it was of course, delicious. I've been eating here for over 15 years (way before they moved), and it's consistently very good. Their rice is fantastic, as are their grape leaves. The meat is always very good, whether it is chicken, gyro meat or their lamb shank. I'm not much into lentils, but I hear their lentil soup is delicious. I also appreciate their large portions and reasonable prices; it's great having left overs. If you are looking for tasty Middle Eastern food in Tempe, I definitely recommend Sahara."
0,Do not eat here.  The pancakes were old and cold - just run away
0,"As a long time Mario fan, having cooked many of his outstanding recipes, been to some of his excellent NY establishments...... Mario should be ashamed to have his name on this restaurant. The past was limp and tasteless, the salad had greens that were not close to fresh, the bread was marginal, the waiter was nice but clueless. We asked the couple sitting next to us what their opinion was, and they were disappointed also. I saw a while back a documentary with Lidia where she politely noted some Bastianvich ventures she is not associated with this experience explains why. I certainly will not write Mario off but he needs to take care of business at B & B."

1,Ate hear again \nRecommend anything green chilie pork here \nBurrito is best value\nFish tacos are insane too \nFree Jalape\u00f1o salsa- got extra for my eggs all week
1,"Fantastic! I love this store, its big, bright and airy. They have a huge assortment, and have hidden secret closets, with even more goodies inside! They carry the most beautiful handbags, and I was told by the salesperson there, are all handmade in Itay. Great experince!"
0,"Passable, but didn't appreciate having the back employee service entrance as the only way into the hotel. (I guess some unfortunate person died from a slab of concrete falling on them in the front entrance). \n Pros: location, and pretty decent breakfast\n\nCons: Breakfast room  way to small to accomodate the amount of guest they have. ( the german tourist didn't understand the concept of waiting their turn).  Felt like an employee walkin thru service corridor everyday."
0,"Man, every time I've gone to this place, the food looks a lot better than it tastes. I've found all the food to be incredibly bland. Disappointing because the atmosphere is pretty cool."
1,"Restaurante Helena is a Portuguese style place located in old Montreal that opened at the end of June. I was looking for a nice restaurant to go enjoy a nice meal with a friend prior to the fireworks in the old port, so we gave it a shot. \n\nThe menu is a combination of tapas style plates or classic entrees and mains. We chose to stick to the tapas options. First up, we had the cod croquettes with a piri piri aioli. Simple but perfectly done. The croquettes had a good crisp to them without the fish in the middle being overdone. The aioli was a great compliment with just the right level of spice without overpowering the fish.\n\nNext up, clams with chorizo, corn and Sao Jorge cheese. A nice light dish where the extra elements didn't take anyway from the key ingredient here, the clams.\n\nFollowing the clams, we got the tempura shrimp with bisque sauce following with the plat of grilled octopus, squid and chorizo. Both were very executed and delicious. The standouts of note here were the bisque sauce and the grilled squid. \n\nAll in all, the food was wonderful and perfectly in keeping with what you would want looking for a good Portuguese meal. As with most tapas plates, you always wish you could have more on the plat, but that comes with the territory. The wine options were relatively plentiful - with the caveat that II don't know much about Portuguese wines. We asked our waiter for his opinion and the choices he made for us were wonderful.  I will note here however that it actually took our waiter about 45 minutes to actually come take our orders after bringing us our wine. Because of our discussion at the table, we didn't actually notice until about 30 minutes. Given we weren't really in a hurry, this didn't bother us in the least but I feel like I need to mention this anyway.\n\nHelena was a pleasant discovery and given its proximity to old Montreal, another great option for people heading to the old port. Anyone looking for a good portuguese place would be wise to check it out.\n\nCheers!"
0,Technician was not professional. Technician did not re-install all components that he removed during installation. Components that were not re-installed were taken by the technician. Technician never mentioned any issues to me or that he was going to not re-install components that he removed. Technician also scratched body paint. Never use again.
0,"All hype and no substance. Our reservation was secured by the concierge at the Four Seasons and we were assured that GR Steak was 'the hot restaurant'. Upon arrival, our party of 4 was ushered to the bar area for what was supposed to be a 10 minute wait. 45 minutes later, our table was ready. Needless to say, we were ready to eat. Only a waiter never materialized. Odd, considering all the staff floating about. Another 10 minutes without any staff interaction and we were on to plan 'b'. Thank you Four Seasons and Mesa Grill for saving the evening!"
1,"What an amazing place that my 6 year old daughter has found. This place has given her so much more than karate. It is a family oriented place that brings strangers together. The instructors are absolutely amazing and really care about the kids.  My daughter works hard and it has been a joy to watch her exceed. The kids have to work for their belts and show what they have learned. Call them and give it a try, you won't regret it."
0,"Worst restaurant I've experienced in my life time.  Avoid at all costs.  I ordered steak and it was like leather.  My girlfriend ordered smoked salmon salad and that was okay, of course hard to screw that one up, I made them replace my steak with the same.  We had get our own water because service was so bad.  Avoid at all costs.  They added a service charge but I had them remove it and then left a 2 cent tip. Another inside was very upset and yelled across the restaurant for service.  What a joke."
1,"Tonight was our (me, wife, and 2 adult kids) first visit RBT - and already, I am a huge fan of  this place!\n\nThe food is great and plentiful, from start to finish.  We didn't realize how big the portions were when we ordered, and we all went home over-full, with leftovers still on our plates.....\n\nWe started by sharing a couple appetizers - onion rings (big and sweet, with just the right amount of breading), and wings (thanks to the advice of our waitress, we got a delicious sauce that was a mix of their \""medium\"" and 'golden\"" sauces - perfect!).  These were excellent, and truly could have been meal-worthy on their own.\n\nBut, we had all ordered burgers already, so onto the main course.  I had the hatch-chili burger on the pretzel bun.  The meat was flavorful, cooked just exactly how I ordered it (medium +), and there was a LOT to this burger - 10 oz!  I could barely get past the halfway point before I pushed away my plate!  I truly wanted to eat more - it really was good - but I had a feeling we'd all be sharing a dessert, so I wanted to save some room. \n\nOnly eating half my burger turned out to be a wise move, because the dessert was insanely good.  We had a \""Pot Brownie\"" (....Imagine two brownies with a layer of marshmallow fluff in between, and pieces of hershey's chocolate throughout, all cooked in a casserole dish (yes, the \""Pot\"" refers to the dish and not an ingredient; bummer for all the hippies) and served piping hot.  I do mean HOT so be careful - my wife burned her mouth!  Though we were all full before dessert arrived, somehow found a way to make room for this testimony to brownie decadence   Do, do, do save room for this when you go to RBT.\n\nAnd, here's the thing about RBT - make sure you have Robin as your server.   When you place your order, you'll begin your meal with Robin as your waitress; by the time you get to dessert, you'll feel like Robin is a dear friend.   Actually, I thinnk you'll find that Robin and this restaurant have a lot in common - welcoming, down to earth, fun, and full of spirit!  An absolute joy - and unquestionably worthy of 5+ stars!"
1,"This place is pretty good.  Convenient and great hours.  Although I greatly prefer rice over a sandwich 95% of the time, this place was pretty good.  Nice location at the edge of the PH Casino and shops.  The food came out very fast and fresh.  Great place for a quick bite with reasonable prices."
1,"I really think that this was the finest meal I've ever had in my life. We had the 5-course menu with wine pairing, and each course blew us away! \n\nThe attention to the tiniest details (we saw the chef literally using tweezers to assemble the plates) to the quality of every ingredient was perfect. While it might be easy to think that this is just expensive frou frou food with too many bells and whistles and not enough food -- this was not the case here! Everything on the plate served a distinct and delicious purpose, and we both left full, satisfied, and with memories that will last a very long time. \n\nI recommend sitting at the \""bar\""/\""counter,\"" if I could even call it that. It was just really awesome to see the chefs at work, and the service was top notch! Not stuffy, pretentious, or rude. Just genuine, attentive, friendly, and so knowledgeable, which is what one would expect for this price tag."

0,Came here last night (Tuesday) to see the Great Gatsby. LOVED the film but on to the theatre.\n\nIt smelled so musty and closed up. I've been to dollar movie theatres that have smelled nicer. A lot of trash on the floor so somebody was not doing their job. Seats need a general makeover- the fabric is torn completely on some of them. The screen had 2 rips in them which was pretty just annoying since it was near the center. Me and my friend were in the theatre with only 2 other people so it was nice not worrying about other people. \n\nI would never recommend this theatre to anyone. Paying $8 (yay student discount) for a theatre like this- UM NO.
1,Always delicious! I love the chopped salad and my hubby gets the seared ahi on fried rice. A bit pricey ($75 for us w/ child) but the kids menu is good - delicious large portions with drink for $5.
0,"Stayed at this hotel for work. Let me start off by saying there is nothing else in close proximity to this hotel or this cafe so I think they have relied on this advantage otherwise there would not stay in business. The food is ALRIGHT but the customer service is terrible. The prices are also a little high... $13 breakfast buffet that consists of\""  dried up eggs, bacon/sausage, and some fruit. I ended up skipping breakfast the last couple of days and just having a starbucks drink from the lobby of the hotel."
0,"This place is trashy, but the music is good. People literally do drugs in public here."
1,"I'll keep this short and to the point...\n\nI went to CarMax to get an appraisal for a car I wanted to sell.  I chose CarMax because I didn't want to go through the process of posting a listing on Craigslist, Autotrader, etc.  My thought was if they gave me a good price I would sell my car on spot.  The service was quick, they have a very friendly staff and the appraisal took 15 minutes.  I was expecting the appraisal to be ~50% of what I had previously valued my car (using KBB and Edmonds), they blew me away and offered 80%.\n\nI couldn't have been happier.  I'll definitely refer friends/family to CarMax as a great way to sell cars."

0,Came here again after my last review and we had to get gas for our rental van and so I pulled up to a pump and I went inside and said the the same lady I seen last time if I could get $120 on pump 2 regular and she said its ready and if u need change or/and receipt come back inside and so I went back outside and put the nozzle into my tank and lifted the nozzle holder on the pump and I talked to my family while getting gas in the car and after the pump clicked off at $100.10 i went back Inside for my change and the lady gave my my change and receipt and I ask her if there car wash was ever going to reopen an the lady said yes it's going to reopen in a month and we are going to have new gas pumps and another gas island and I said ok and thank you. \n\n\nThis place is now improving. My last review was on this place and I said to stay away. But I will give this place 2 more times.
1,"Best Taco Bell for sure!  The staff is usually friendly, I am usually surprised by this fast food staff.  They seem to be happy at this location and it shows in the service and food.  I never had missing items, extra sauce, and napkins, etc.  Food is hot and staff is friendly.  \nI applaud the manager at this location, he/she run a great group of customer friendly staff."
0,"We had a very unfortunate experience with the boarding service at Town Center Animal Hospital. We left our dog in their care for just over 24 hours. We were told she would be walked twice a day and fed according to her normal schedule. We picked her up with only half her food emptied from the bag (they obviously skipped her meal time as we gave them just enough for the length of her stay). Since we returned home she has wet her sleeping kennel once, wet in the house twice (that is very much out of the ordinary as she is fully house trained). We believe she was not walked and left to go potty solely in her kennel as her paws were very soiled as well. Her demeanor was shaken for a few days following her return home. We found it very strange for such a short stay there. We have had her in boarding numerous times in the past and have never experienced this. In short it was the worst boarding care we have experienced. I do not recommend them and quite honestly expected more out of a animal hospital."
0,"The server, who looked Spanish, was horrible. So horrible, I realize I don't even know his name. He ignored me when I called to him and only raised his hand to acknowledge my call the second time around, without turning his head. When we were paying, he left the credit card machine with us, so we had to tear our own receipt, while he chatted with a larger group.There was not one smile. No introduction. No request for drinks. The food  left us desiring as well. Monotone tub of gnocchi. Pasta with meat sauce, fries and the calamari were good. Bruschetta was freshly made but just didn't have anything to it. Bread was cold but we were so hungry, bread dipped in evoo and pesto was good. The server experience really ruined our first night in montreal for that trip. I have been here many years ago and was hoping for the same fun night out but I guess things change."
1,Fast delivery\nEasy to order \nWide selection\nDelicious\nWill order from here in the future;) NO DOUBT
1,"What a meal! I was really surprised by this place. You dont expect this quality in a casino.\n\nI went with a party of 6 and had a gargantuan meal. \n\nFor starters this was the best calamari i had ever eaten, hands down.\n\nMy 24oz porterhouse was cooked to perfection. \n\nI tasted some of my brothers lamb, it was lamby... Not my taste but he loved it.\n\nThe chocolate cake was meh... But the creme brule was crazy good.\n\nTop it off with a double cognac to finish, and it was a meal of a lifetime!"
1,"We were a bit disappointed that we were unable to get a reservation to Gordon Ramsey's so we settled for the Strip House.  As far as steakhouses go in Vegas, this place was really a lot better than I expected. We had reservations on Memorial Day around 5pm and there weren't many other people in the joint at that time, which made it feel very personal.  \n\nWe ordered the scallops for an appetizer and they were cooked perfectly. I did not try any of the bread selections as I am gluten free but the pretzel looked very inviting.  \n\nFor the meal, I had the aged Ribeye and sauteed mushrooms. My buddy had the 12oz Filet and steamed broccoli. The steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The only real suggestion that I have for them would be to add creamed spinach, but that all depends on whether or not you enjoy it. \n\nThe service was great, they were always there to refill our waters and etc. \n\nThe price was a bit high  but then again it is Vegas and a up-scale steakhouse.  \n\nOverall I thought the place was very solid and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a steak in Planet Hollywood."
1,"For beer connoisseurs, this is the place to go to. Every week they have different beers and usually over 20 beers on tap every night. They also have alot of hard to get beers in bottles. Best of all the have a cask beer that they open every friday. I have been to the bar more that 10 times and everytime I come there is a different list to choose from. I do not think I have had the same beer tqice at the bar.\nThe bar looks more like an old fashioned bar without tvs. At night the bar is rather dimly lit, but still a great ambiance. The most surprising thing, is that many of the beers are priced around 4 to 5 dollars which most bars would charge 6 dollars for. Being from CA I am happy to see alot of Stone brewery beers which are extremly tasty. Many of the customers are young people who are in grad school or are working, with the atmosphere really laid back."
1,"We had a phenomenal experience with our All Night Long dj for our April 5 wedding reception at the Flamingo. I had a bunch of specific requests and the DJ Tom far exceeded all our expectations. He was really friendly and personable, introducing himself and checking in with us in the beginning to ensure we got the best experience possible.  It was perfect and I highly recommend All Night Long!!"
1,"I am 84 and have been retired from Ford Motor Company  for 30 years, after spending 30 years in several management positions, this past Friday (2-28-14), I had my 2008 Mercury Grand Marquis brakes serviced at Mr. Brake. I must say that the Owner/Manager and his Service Staff are the most honest and trustworthy people I have ever encountered at any service shop. I highly recommend that anyone needing brake service would be well served to have your work done at this location.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was greeted by Bill, he immediately took my vehicle into the shop, checked out the problem, gave me a very reasonable estimate, made the required repairs on a very timely basis, gave me the final bill which was exactly as the  estimate, and I was on my way within an hour, it just does not get any better than at Mr Brake...

1,"If money is no object, then I HIGHLY suggest you  give Daniel a try at the Chandelier Bar.  I mean, don't you HAVE to have a cosmo in the Cosmo?  It was TOTALLY different but the same...then on a whim he whipped me up a martini that encompassed lemon/egg white and rosemary.  Yipes!  What a magician.  It was like having a drink made by the Martha Stewart's of bartenders.  Brava!"
0,"This place amazes me. As do the positive reviews posted here. I can't help but wonder about the positive reviews. Even allowing for differences in taste I can't imagine so many people speaking positively about this restaurant. It's worth noting that personnel from the restaurant are clearly monitoring this website. At the time of this review there is at least one reviewer mentioning that they were contacted by the management after leaving a one star review of this restaurant. They then changed their review to four stars.\n\nWe first went to this restaurant quite a few years ago. At that time it wasn't anything special but it was at least possible to go in to the restaurant and get decent pizza sometimes. One of the draws to this restaurant for us was that they make a Sicilian pizza. Again, it was nothing great, but there are very few choices when it comes to Sicilian pizza in AZ. The service in the restaurant has always been a problem. It's almost like they screen to find the worst help they can find. Our experience has been that most of the help seems very young and they look and act like they would much rather be doing something else somewhere else.\n\nBased on our experience the restaurant has really gone down hill since we first went there. We eventually got to the point where we just got Sicilian pizza and garlic knots and just got take out. Even then the length of time between visits became longer and longer as our experiences got worse and worse. My fiance insists on going back there every once in a while because it is so hard to get Sicilian pizza anywhere else. We also had hopes that after a while things might get better if there were personnel or management changes. Alas, that has not been the case.\n\nEven with limited visits we have encountered a strange problem when getting takeout Sicilian pizza. They rarely seem to cook the pizza enough. It nearly always seems to be undercooked underneath, on top, or both. I got into the habit of making specific requests asking them to cook the pizza more but it just falls on deaf ears. Tonight we ordered a Sicilian pizza and garlic knotts. BOTH were undercooked and three of us with greatly different tastes and standards when it comes to food were all in agreement on how this food was undercooked and doughy. Why is it so hard to cook the food sufficiently?\n\nMy fiance called and lodged yet another complaint. I told her she was wasting her time and that we needed to just stay away from this restaurant permanently. I believe the manager is going to send her a gift certificate but since we have no intention of ever returning there this will not be of much use. The only reason I give this restaurant one star is because they won't allow you to give less."

1,"This is a groovy place.  The food, the service and the atmosphere is really welcoming and nice.  It's a very open environment with great bar and outdoor seating.  The parking lot is large; we've never had trouble finding a place to park.  I had their chopped salad and it was excellent.  This is definitely a \""Keeper Place.\""  Check it out!"
1,"I went for a couple of days to vegas and was looking for the best bbq, this didn't leave me down!\nI miss it already it was sooo yummy, the meat was so good marinated and the kimchi so tasty too\n\nThe only reason that Im giving it 4 and not a 5 \nIt's because of the service,  even the guy was really nice and ask several times if we were ok and serve really friendly I didn't like that after 1 hour eating I went to the bathroom and when I come back my friend on the table told me that they turn off the heat ...\nFell like they wanted to say that we should leave kinda rude and they wasn't closing. ..\n\nAnyways, it is really worth it\nI paid 25 ayce and 11 for suju (really expensive suju)\nI had a really nice night and if I could comeback I would."
1,"The portions are HUGE!\nCame here for breakfast and the omelets are ginormous! They were very filling and tasty as well! I might just share one next time. \nThe Frozen Hot Chocolate was good as well, but pretty overpriced. \nI believe there was a coupon in the booklet they gave us when we checked in at Planet Hollywood, but we didnt see it until after we left."
0,"Was at Surrender for MDW to see Calvin Harris, bought prepaid tickets which got us in fast, despite arriving at the scene at 11:30pm. After entering the club hassle-free, the excitement quickly dwindled. \nThe concept of having 80% of the club outdoor is nice, however the implementation was poor. Calvin Harris was playing at the indoor portion of the club, except no one was allowed on the dance floor except if you purchased a $3000 table. Why even let people in if you don't allow anyone on the dance floor? Waste of money on cover, and it wasn't like the cover was cheap either; $100 for guys and $40 for ladies. Go somewhere else to have a  good time."
1,"Please give this place a try when you're making your next stop at Pita Jungle. This restaurant seems to be very underrated and overlooked. We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and it was empty while Pita Jungle was packed. Just the two of us on the patio, which was very nice. The interior and atmosphere are great. Nice tables & chairs, candles, shelves with wine bottles and art, and a very nice bar.\n\nAn Iranian family owns the restaurant and cooks everything themselves. That's the first sign of a high-quality establishment. They were incredibly nice to us and brought us whatever we needed. They gave us some good suggestions, like their Iced Black Tea, which is fantastic. It has a few other elements to it including Lavender. They brought us extra pita when we ordered some appetizers as well without us even asking.\n\nFor our appetizers, we tried the hummus and the tabooli. The hummus was very creamy but a little plain. We wished there was more flavor or spice to it. Not a big deal. That was the only part of our meal that was not 5 stars, but 4 stars. The tabooli....ridiculous. I've never been a fan of tabooli. It usually has too much parsley. But their version was balanced perfectly.\n\nFor an entree, I tried the Chicken Shawarma and we split a side of Basmati rice with saffron. A huge plate of rice with great seasoning. The saffron and olive oil gave the fluffy rice great texture. The Shawarma was fresh and delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Persian vanilla ice cream with rose water and saffron as well as the Baghlava. The ice cream was some of the best we've had. Great flavor. The Baghlava was a great complement to the ice cream. A nice sweetness from the honey and the flaky dough was great.\n\nSo in summary, great atmosphere, great owners, out-of-this-world food, and very affordable. Everything we had came to about $32. We will return many times in the future because their menu is very promising. Just wish their name fit the type of place that it is. The current name makes it sound like just another Middle Eastern restaurant, which it definitely is not."
0,"I went to Carrabba's last night for a birthday celebration. Being raised in an Italian house I have no preconceived notion that ANY commerial Italian food restaurant will satisfy my tastebuds - Carrabba's did not change this assessment. I had the Chicken and Spinich Cannelloni with Sausage Lental Soup. The innars of the Cannelloni lacked seasioning and was overshadowed by the sweetness of the equally unseasoned sauce. The Sausage Lental soup, for me, was the best part of the meal but was over peppered (black pepper). The bread served at the table wasn't removly crusty and appeared to be brown a serve (and not browned, i might add).\n\nService: The wait staff was well intentioned but obviously not up to serving a party of 14 quickly. I had to wait for drinks, seasoning for my olive oil, and then the bill (about $70).\n\nI would not recommend this place..though, as I said, I'm accustomed to better italian food. Besides, I make better italian food myself (thanks Mom)."
0,I order a pizza and side salad to go for dinner.  One couple in the restaurant and it was 6:30 pm.  I have had better frozen pizza and the Italian dress was lackluster.

0,This was on Diners Drive Ins and Dives. I had the pork burrito that Guy had. I was so disappointed.  The temperature of it was slightly warm at best.  It was suppose to be somewhat spicy but was very bland. It may have been better if I was able to bring it home and reheat it but I was traveling and could not do that.  The service was very good.
0,Bland food. Got the #7 platter which is a fish taco and a mini burrito. The fish taco had no flavor and the mini burrito was sub par. The iced tea is from a machine and tasted awful! I poured it out and got the instant lemonade instead.
1,Gotta love a place that has Grandma Goldie's clock & old school chairs as part of the decor!  We started with tomato casserole (heaven on a plate) & Shreiner's stuffed dates. Not really hungry anymore - had to try the duet: stuffed portobello & red pepper as well as the handcakes with kale & romanesco sauce (empanada-ish)!  Yumm!!!  Definitely a place to revisit & enjoy small plates. They care deeply about their wine & was much appreciated!
0,"After seeing this on The Food Network, I was super excited to try it. It was not great! \nI had the Mahi Mahi tacos both BBQ and blackened. Too much seasoning and salty. The crab and shrimp dip appetizers were ok, they tasted like a sour cream and onion potato chip. \n\nService was awesome! But I will not be back:("
1,Love coming to this GNC!! They stay fully stocked and I have NEVER seen a supplement store fully stocked. The staff is so knowledgeable and recommended the right supplements for what I wanted to achieve. They also give great advice!! A+A+A+A+

1,Great food and great service. I miss their old location but the new location has more room. It's great to see Joe and Joe working and talking to all the customers
0,"Kitschy name, cute concept, a little indie place in an area consumed by monolithic chains -- Oink really had all the potential in the world. \n\nThe space is simple, open, and clean, although very sparse --  what some may interpret as modern simply reeked of half-assedness to me. \""Hey, let's throw some pink paint on one wall and call it a day!\"" The bathrooms had fancy schmancy modern sinks and fixtures, although the weekly cleaning form on the back of the door was, disconcertingly, completely blank.\n\nThe service was super average, better than I expected considering I had heard it was atrocious. My breakfast-loving SO and I did our usual, each of us getting our own separate egg things followed by a shared short stack of blueberry pancakes. My omelet was nice, steaming hot and full of nice fresh veggies. The home fries on the side, though, were cold. The English muffin was barely toasted, also cold, and so slathered in butter it was slippery. My SO inhaled most of his Hollandaise-slathered Benedict, but let's face it, he'd slurp down a dog turd if it was drenched in Hollandaise. The pancakes were completely and utterly unremarkable, as was the OJ (watery and bitter) and coffee. \n\nThe sucker punch was the bill: with tip, over $40 for two for breakfast. If I wanted to shell out $40 for breakfast, I would stay in my own hood and go to Taylor's where I know the food will be spectacular and the service top-notch. Alternatively, I could go to IHOP across the street, where I know the food will be reliably above average for half the price.\n\nSorry, Oink, your prices make you little piggies. You've gotta step up your game, because no one wants to pay Paradise Valley prices for a Glendale experience."
1,"This sports bar is the king of the lunch special. Good choices and good prices. My only complaint is that the service is slow. If you go for lunch expect your whole lunch hour to be sapped. But, the food is tasty, the drinks are cold, and the price is right."
0,"We have been flying this airline for a number of years due to convenience of locations and the free miles we earn with their cards. In the past, they were quite good, able to trouble shoot problems we had on two occasions in foreign airports (Frankfort and Sao Paulo). \n\nIn the last few years customer service has deteriorated. When we tried to deal with an international flight that had too tight a connection in a foreign airport, they were rude and uncooperative over the phone and after an hour haggling with them, they made a change to an itinerary that was just as bad. \n\nAirline attendants have never been that good there, rudeness not uncommon. The food used to be at least okay. The last two years the food on their planes has been inedible. We now take our own food on the plane even though the meal is included. \n\nAt a recent flight, our luggage was damaged upon arrival. Their staff at the baggage claim was very uncooperative and denied any responsibility. Obviously, I couldn't prove it was their incompetence so all I have left is this review. \n\nChoices for the kind of flights we need at Sky Harbor is limited so switching to another airline isn't much of an option. US Air is just as bad. The difference is that US Air was always bad, UA wasn't until a few years ago. Clearly, something has changed in their system to cause this."
0,"I have been there twice now, didn't want to write a bad review based on 1 visit, especially since they just opened.   But after today definitely won't go back. Do not sit in a booth!  There are big crossboards poking through that are very uncomfortable. I had the lunch special,  a turkey and ham sandwich on a sub roll. Absolutely awful.  There was a lake of water/mayo on my plate after one bite that dripped out of my sandwich. The cook must have no experience. The two slices of tomato were hot, like fresh out of the microwave,  and ruined. My friend had their avocado BLT,  and the bacon was so burnt she couldn't eat it. But they gave us a $1.50 discount off of our bill. The waitress tried her best, but good service can't make up for lousy, over priced food. Probably an ok place to drink at. But I do not recommend it for lunch. Too bad, was excited for a new lunch place right by my office."
0,"Flat Top holds a very very special place in my heart. Back when we were in high school, groups of us would wheedle and deal in order to secure a car, pack it full (ah, the days before there were limits on teenage drivers and their passengers), and drive it 20 minutes over to the newly opened Flat Top by Northwestern. We totally felt cool because a) we were on a college campus, b) this do-your-own-stir-fry was a total novelty, and c) it was fun coming up with new combos...that we had made up.\n\nFast forward the years. Flat Top has apparently now opened a location steps away from UIUC. And it sucks. It sucks pretty bad. I hope it's an anomaly rather than a decline of the chain as a whole. Or maybe it's always been this way and I've never noticed??\n\nI decided on Flat Top for lunch because some of the other places I wanted to try were closed in preparation for the upcoming school year. And I seemed to remember that Flat Top was pretty quick. I was wrong.\n\n*Waited awhile to be greeted. It seemed to be short-staffed, which I kind of understand because it's summer, plus they opened 40 minutes earlier. But noon was in 20 minutes...is this how you usually roll?\n*The hostess couldn't decide where to seat me...a lone diner all by myself. She veered from the front where there were several groups. She was going to seat me at the high-tops, but given that there were several pairs there, veered from the empty ones. She then seated me...in a corner...all the way around the back. Uh, ok.\n*Seriously, if you don't know what you're going to put in your stir fry, back up a little instead of blocking the area with your nose pressed up against the glass guard and your head whipping back and forth reading the sauces. Or loiter in that extra empty space to make a decision. I understand you're here for orientation for your kid or something...but some of us have power lunches.\n*No employees at the stir-fry station with four or five already on the grill and four or five lined up to be placed on the grill. However, they do let you go thru the line again to make another dish while you're enjoying the first one to save time if you're doing the unlimited option. \n*Needless to say, it took forever to get my first dish...15 minutes. And then my second dish came two minutes after...which was brought by the original hostess who said confusedly, \""I thought you were dining alone?\""\n*The ingredients were AWFUL. They just opened for the day...but it was so obvious that the ingredients weren't fresh! The baby corn and bamboo shoots had a distinctly sour taste to them. Green peppers in my stir fry when I never put in green peppers. Vegan meat dry, rubbery, and tasteless. Even the beef had the sour taste of it standing around being marinated in its own sweat for hours. The squid was rubbery. And I think they use egg substitutes because that definitely did not taste like normal egg. I have to say that the tofu was okay though.\n*If you're sitting back to back in the booth chairs, they're pretty flimsy. The kid behind me kept shifting and I could feel every thump he made. It drove me nuts.\n\nSo. The only reason why this place didn't get one star? Julia, my waitress. She was calm, efficient, and kept up a running conversation as she moved from table to table. She's quite the lady...knows a lot about obscure UIUC stuff and is super friendly to boot. Once she realized that I was on a schedule, she even offered me the check early so I didn't have to wait for her in case she got held up. Really awesome...thanks! $8.99 for a one bowl lunch, $9.99 for the unlimited option. If you're a student, you get a $1 discount.\n\nThanks, Flat Top, for shattering a high school memory."
0,"Service was terrible, took 4 phone calls and a trip to the front desk to get towels. 2 out of 12 elevators were working. 0 out of 12 were working on the last day. Took stairs into a construction site with all our bags. Parking lot was full. Don't stay here."
0,"Nothing is new here about my bad experience. But hopefully I can shed some light into their evil world. And then the travelers can choose wisely.\n\nUS Worst has retained its title for me in 2011.\n\nTypical story. Mechanical failure. Flight was delayed in Palm Springs. I missed the connection in Phoenix. I was rescheduled for later flight. A delay of 4 hours.\n\nI always avoid US Worst but sometimes it's just impossible. It helps when US Worst is part of Star Alliance (Wrong... more later). I was a United Premier member. I thought I still can get my benefit on US Worst. That's a wrong assumption.\n\nI have experienced nightmares on more than 50% of US Worst flights. More so lately... 100% in past 2 years (2 flights). Luckily I've shifted all possible flights to other not so worst airlines.\n\nTo make a long tedious nightmare educational:\n1) US Worst does not recognize the full status of United Premier. Not like United and Continental.\n\n2) It's business as usual for US Worst. The costumer service rep expressed indifference. It reminds me of rental clerks in Las Vegas and FlorIda (\""you don't like it? Too bad! Move aside, there's a long line waiting for our premiere service\"") There is no apology. The mechanic failure and that delayed flight did not qualify for any compensation.\n\nSo travelers, kowtow to the Almighty US Worst whom provides world class service to everyone. I wonder what service you will get in economy class."
0,"Mandy's food is OK. The pizza is mediocre, often burnt,  but the sandwiches are very good. We moved to Observatory Hill about 18 months ago and we like to support local businesses. However, after 6 months of consistently terrible service we sadly had to find a new pizza place. Every single time I have called in an order I would be put on hold for several minutes right away. That is a long time to be on hold and I understand places get busy, but every time? To top it off the employees would often argue with me about my order \""we would like a large pizza.\"" Employee: \""you mean a 16 inch?\"" Me: \""I don't know, the menu I am using doesn't have the inches listed.\"" Employee: \""Well it's 16 inches.\"" Another time I was asked what size fries I wanted. I told them I didn't order fries. They had so much trouble understanding that I had not ordered fries that it turned into a yelling match. Never before in my life have I felt so harassed trying to place an order.\n\nOne time the delivery driver called my cell phone and hung up when I answered. I went outside and asked him why he just hung up. Driver : \""I can't spare the minutes.\"" This is the same driver who brings his dog in the car and when he isn't making deliveries the dog sits in his car all day in front of the pizza shop. What someone else said about the employees looking like parolees is definitely spot on. Some drivers will just call your cell and not even GET OUT OF THEIR CAR to deliver your order, instead waiting for you to come to the drivers window.\n\nOn one occasion I went to pick up an order at the store and the counter near the door looked like the pick up area but it was actually at the other end of the counter. Therefore, I was simply ignored until I figured out I was standing at the wrong end. Then the employee tried to make me feel stupid by telling me \""Yeah, I had no idea why you were standing there. No one has ever stood there before.\""\n\nSeriously?  It's just unbelievable how rude these people are. Check it out for yourself."
0,"Let's just get right to the point:\n\nThe selection was small and way over-priced.  This might be Vegas and you can probably get away with it but $13/lb?  Get real!  Everything was typical finds you can find at your local malls.  I still ended up buying a pound to get my chocolate fix while downing some vodka in the hotel room but I wasn't too impressed.,\n\nFor a place with The Pussycat Dolls endorsing it, I was expecting SO much  more.  Oh well.  I'd still go back if only to buy that cute shirt I saw."
0,"This is the closest sushi place to my house and it is not good. Iv'e given it about three tries, each time there is a issue with service and the fish just isn't good. I drive down to my old stomping grounds near Sahara to Sushi Fever when I want decent sushi."
1,"I bought my dress in a Demetrios store in GA but had all of my alterations done here. I have nothing but great things to say about much of the process. In total I had two fittings. The fitting appointments fill up quickly and have very limited hours but are totally worth it. During my first appointment it was determined that I needed some boning to support my bust, hemming, and addition of a bustle. On my second appointment the dress was PERFECT. I knew I was in good hands but to see the dress fit perfect was a great feeling. All of the women that work there are so friendly and accommodating. The only reason it got 4 stars and not 5 is the actual cost of the alterations-almost half the the cost of the dress. The 1 inch of hemming was way more than it would have been other places. However, I was willing to pay it to have the piece of mind that I did and it was totally worth it. I HIGHLY recommend this location to all brides trying to find \""the\"" dress!"
1,"This was the most beautiful ceremony, and if you get the photographer, they like to take a lot of pictures. But my only tip is to show up maybe a day before to sign all the paperwork and everything so that you won't be waiting around in your wedding dress while guest start to show up while they file the paperwork away. Other than that, everything went smooth. The drivers were awesome and knew all the side roads so we wouldn't be late. My husband and I had a great time and enjoyed everything."

0,"By far the worst manicure pedicure I have ever received. They rough, rude and provide low grade services. I actually need to file my nails to be even and my gel manicure was globbed on. Better luck doing your own nails."
0,"Yelp suggests that 2 stars means \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" And I think that is the appropriate rating for an experience that starts off promising it will help you achieve your fitness goals but ends with the familiar and sickening feeling that you're just a cash cow.\n\nIf you are like me or one of the many graduate students in this area looking for a positive, professional and results-driven workout for a year or less, keep looking. You're better off using your money for some lessons from a personal trainer, some music for your mp3 player, and varying up your routine as much as possible.\n\nWhile I love the intensity of OT workouts and the great music, I have gotten more motivation and knowledge out of DVDs from Target.\n\nOT is just like a 24-Hour or LA Fitness chain, which make money from sign-ups, NOT from service or results. The main difference at OT is the sleek interior design, a claim to be more effective, and over $100 per month - the premium for so-called training.\n\nWhen I signed up here, they acted like they really wanted to see me succeed, but sadly they never did anything to help me monitor or achieve the goals they asked me to set. That makes me think it was just a show to get me to sign-up. They had us download an app which supposedly offers many cool functionalities, none of which work (except for the ability to book a session, which by the way can be impossible to do during evening and weekend hours. They don't care if you get in; in fact, it benefits them when less people sign up.) Any questions I asked, I usually got a shrug in response. OT's claim to fame is \""heart-rate tracking\"", but they don't store any information after you walk out the door, nor do they help you interpret it. It may well be a gimmick, and I'm sure they are making a lot of money on that high elastic strap surcharge. My heart rate monitor was constantly out of whack so I didn't even really benefit from having it. At OT, \""trainers\"" don't teach proper stretching. The class is so fast-paced they barely have time to show you correct form before racing to the next exercise. You have to beg for attention and help if you want to learn - when you look around and see everyone doing it differently, it makes you wonder if anyone is doing it properly.\n\nToday the manager, who is never there because he also runs another franchise location, referred to one of the associates as \""my front desk girl,\"" I realized what kind of establishment I was dealing with and gave up my request not to be charged for the 60 days after my official cancellation. OT is not a franchise that trusts its own managers to run a business. Instead, it values short-term profits from sign-ups over long-term relationships. It was an expensive lesson to avoid Orange Theory, and I hope this review can save a few people having to pay the same price. \n\nIf you decide to give it a try, I hope you are extremely self-motivated and already very knowledgeable about how to achieve your fitness goals. I hope you also have the foresight or legal expertise to actually cancel 60 days before you want to stop going, even if they claim its 30 days notice."
1,The service was fabulous!   The food was outstanding and freshly served. The chefs are very meticulous and create a beautiful delivery of the food. Great ambiance. My favorite was the pink lady and the spicy yellowtail. A must eat at restaurant if you like sushi!!
1,"I have never had a bad experience here. I usually carryout, but dine in every now and again. The wait staff is always fast and friendly. The hoagies are huge and tasty. The pizza is just right. Sometimes the wait to eat can be around 10-15 minutes especially on Fridays and Saturdays but that can be expected. I actually don't think I have ever been here during the weekends when just about every booth was filled with customers. Go check it out, I don't think you will be disappointed."
0,It's just kinda ok. Drinks aren't that great. I mean stick to beer. A bartender can't mess up a beer. Mixed drinks were weak. Seemed like the place was too busy for on hands to deal with. Mixed drinks are too pricey for what u get. It's not good Mexican food either. Its just ok Americanized Mexican food. When u walk into a Mexican restaurant and the lady working there gives u attitude cuz she needs to serve you during her novelas that's a Mexican restaurant.  But its locations cool. There's just too many places too eat in Vegas. Not worth it bros.
1,"Awesome work out!! I have been going for just a little over a month and already hooked. Every work out is hard but never out of your ability. The coach (Jake) evaluates your strength and level of fitness and pushes you just right. So it doesn't matter what kind of shape you are in, you will get a great work out out of every single session. I have noticed that all parts of my fitness have improved during this short period of time I have been going. Everyone is really friendly and you never feel pressured or judged. You are encouraged by your peers and the coaches there and just make you want to come back time and time again. Everyone I step into this gym, the people there make you feel like they are happy to see you. And I think they really are!!!"
0,"Extremely poor management, the cashiers were very understaffed people were waiting in line for 15 to 20 minutes. There were cashiers leaving the checkout line to go check in the back of the store for a price of a wallet. They looked like they were lost and did not know what they were doing there was no manager in sight. I was very disappointed in the service and left my clothes there without purchasing as I will never shop there again."
0,"Resort fee is bogus.  Hotel hosted radio station party at pool, opened it up to public, leaving no room for guests.  I was told by manager that guests should reserve their chair at 9am if they want a spot.  A lot for pleasing the customer. We will be  spending our money elsewhere next time"
1,"I remember staying here for a weekend and was expecting it to be too mature of a place for us, young, girls to enjoy Vegas.\nHowever, this is one of the few times I was pleasantly mistaken. \nStaying at Bellagio was a great experience. The service from the front desk to the bell hop to the room service. Everything exceeded my expectations.\nThe room was quite roomy for 2 double beds and even a living area. Customer service went beyond protocol- customer service with a smile would be an understatement.\nBellagio ranks among the top places to stay, IMO, and I would recommend this spot to anyone planning a trip to sin city."
0,"Pretty dumpy place. We got a room here because it was the cheapest place we could find that was anywhere near downtown. The ceiling had weird brown spots on it that looked like someone threw feces at it. The sheets were pretty scratchy and the bed and pillows were not very comfortable. The bed cover had stains on it, everything just looked pretty dingy. The building outs pretty confusing and it is pretty dumb that you can't get from the lobby to your room after 11:00pm since you have to go through the pool area. Just a ridiculous set up if you ask me. Would probably spend a few extra bucks and go elsewhere next time."
0,"Worst service ever! Came to dine in.... Waited 30 minutes for beverages, 45 minutes for pizza, and at 1 hour we still don't have our apps....\n\nThey seem to have 3 people at the takeout counter, and no dedicated waitresses for eat-in. One person took our order, another brought our drinks (after I went to counter and asked for them), and another brought pizza. \n\nPeople coming in for takeout trump those sitting at tables. We were told they would comp part of our meal and add desserts.... In the end, waitress brought wrong bill, and then seemed confused when I said it wasn't ours. I have never wanted to dine and dash so badly! She finally came with a stack of receipts (none ours) and then wrote on the receipt, $12. \n\nFood would get 5 stars, garlic balls are delicious... Would maybe try takeout, but NEVER eat in again..."
0,"I grew up in Squirrel Hill and have been going to the Squirrel Hill Flower Shop for the 20 years I lived there and then phoning in orders for the ten years since I left. I felt loyal to them since they're a local business in my neighborhood. But they are so consistently unpleasant when I phone, and seem disinterested in my business and reluctant to help me to select flowers. For example, this morning when I phoned:\n\nme: I'd like to send flowers to my mother.\nthem: we're only doing open (\""open-something\"" - I can't remember the term).\nme: what is that?\nthem: designer choice\nme: what is that?\nthem: the florist puts stuff together\nme: can you describe anything more about the \""stuff\""?\nthem: no, we can't tell you the type of flowers or colors.\nme: well, it's hard to spend money on something when you know nothing about it. can I get it without the vase.\nthem: yes. it's $50 plus $10 deliver.\nme: and without the vase?\nthem: it's still $50.\n\nSo I declined and found, through Yelp, Alex's flowers on Craig Street, where the owner was very charming and descriptive about the flowers and what he could put together, and very reassuring that the bouquet would be beautiful."
0,If hanging around a bunch a douchy frat boys is your style then get here early BC you wont want to miss out on all of the fun. The place is dingy and the food really stinks. As bars go this is the kind of spot that high schoolers would go to with their fake ids and would fit right in.
1,"A hip little eatery that embraces the intricacies of what Vietnamese cuisine possesses when conveyed at its best.The restaurant's sleek, modern and stylish lines match the food. Service was mediocre at best, but at least they weren't rude. Dessert was good, not amazing, but the meal more than made up for it."
0,"Their delivery service was disappointing.  I was told 45min to an hour for delivery. At about 45 minutes the driver shows up with the wrong pizza.  He calls in and they tell him that it's in the oven, so he tells me he'll be right back. 45 minutes later he shows up with a cold pizza. This ruined the dinner experience.  I couldn't tell you if their pizza is good because I am not a fan of room temperature pizza. As a consolation the bum driver gave me some coupons (thanks!)."

1,"Husband and I made it over last Sunday and loved it.  Couldn't get over how developed that part of town is!    Definitely think this is the sharpest, most interesting place in that area...\n\nInside, they've done a  nice job of tricking up the interior to make it feel less strip mall.  I loved the atmosphere although the booths weren't very comfortable nor were they sound buffered - we could hear every word of the conversations around us...\n\nI'd made a short list of items (okay, it was too long) that I wanted to make sure we tried...\n\nWe started with the mandu - needed some seasoning but that's what dippping sauce is for -- the filling and portion size was generous.  I'm a sucker for dumplings and love how every culture has one - and I love em all.  \n\nWe had the buckwheat noodle soup - it will be coming off the menu as soon as temperatures come down and I've been telling my husband about this dish from EJo... I was thrilled to see it on Soyo's menu.  I had him taste it before adding the vinegar/mustard - he pronounced it flat...I swirled in the magic ingredients and this time his eyes sparkled - it's his kind of dish --  light, bright, surprising, complex but simple.  I loved their version.\n\nWe had their KFC (actually the spicy garlic wings) - these were sticky, ooey, gooey delicious - and I normally am not a wing fan...but I thought these were yummy.\n\nWe also tried their rice wine - it comes in a bowl with a ladle...and it's addictive.  Light alcohol content, cold, sweet, a little sparkly, think unfiltered sake spritzer or new wine.  Delicious.  (And enough for two to share...or not)\n\nI didn't realize how wonderful Hite beer is until Sunday either -- it's got a touch of sweetness-- perfect for spicy Korean food.  I think Hite is probably my favorite beer right now...\n\nWe also tried their kimchee pancake.  Great, but could have been crispier, downright soggy in the middle...but we ate it all with relish.  Sort of hard to complain about when you've pretty much licked the plate clean.\n\nAll in all, it was a great first experience...we probably should have tried their bulgogi, but we'll do that the next time - because we will definitely go back."

0,I let my Costco membership expire when this Sam's Club near my house opened up.  At first it was nice but then the honeymoon wore off.  The selection was not as good and the service was horrible.  \n\nIt seems the last few times I have gone the person in front of me buys something from the security cage.  It has taken what seems like 20 minutes for them to get the manager who has the key and get the item every time.  The manager is at a podium 20 yards away and the secure cage is 20 yards in the other direction.  I don't expect Olympic pace but this is not even a snail's pace.  \n\nThen the service at the food counter is also horrible continuing with the theme.  The employees walk around behind the counter like they are laboring just to move around and it hurts them to grab a hot dog out of the container and put it in a bun and wrapper for you.  To drive it home they might throw it on the counter for you like they did for me.\n\nEven though the Costco is a few more miles away and much busier all I have to say is Costco here I come.
0,"Shitty little Chinese places usually have alright food.. not this place.. nothing we tried even tasted good. A real emphasis on shitty! Ordered tofu, sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls as well as house lo mein.. I think it was the oil because everything sort of tasted rancid and was seriously greasy. Also the shrimp in the house lo mein didn't smell very good so I picked it out.. still the greasy noodles didn't sit well with me or my friend. She ended up getting sick right afterward though I was fine. \n\nI am convinced that there is ZERO decent Chinese in Surprise! Perhaps there is another place I should check out?"
1,"The show never gets boring! You must take jokes on the extreme ends to enjoy this one. Love the up-close distance of the stage and audience, you'd fear for the antics performers. Entertaining!"
1,"I'm a huge fan of Yelp.  Looked this place up and discovered I drove past it for a while missing the opportunity to stop by.  All I can say is wow.  Seriously amazing food that would bury the competition in the Caribbean.  Check in with Mayor Eddie, who politely let me know I was eating my taco \""like a white guy\"".  You have to get your hand around the back of it to savor the 17 different flavors.  He was right.  Great job...\n\nThe staff was eager to help us in any way.  Very attentive and fun."
1,"Woohoo!  Best Cirque show I've been to yet!  Some might say I am biased because I have this love for Beatles music, but I think that the content of the show and the theatrics were very exciting from beginning to end.  I was sitting on the second to the top tier as we had discounted locals tix and the view was still great.  Granted, I would've liked to sit a little closer (for reasons that I will not disclose because there is a certain part of the show that gets the people up front involved) but watching from up top was still awesome.  The music timed up with the theatrics was a real treat as well because it's 1) obviously the Beatles and 2) the mixing of the songs were seamless and flowed very nicely.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was my pricey beer.  But, hey, it's the Mirage so what do you expect?\n\nDefinitely a treat and I would highly recommend!"
0,"Wow!  I wish I could give this place zero stars...as in this place sucks, avoid at all costs.  \n\nAs others have stated, we purchased a deal voucher for what seemed like a lot.  We were greatly looking forward to our visit.  It happened to be a football weekend so we called ahead and asked if they were a \""sports bar\"" and if they had NFL ticket.  We received a definitive \""YES, we have all the games\"".  When we arrived, no one was at the host(ess) stand and someone from across the room yelled \""sit wherever you want\"".  Nice first impression.  We headed to the bar.  They had ONE game on...the local game. The bar was empty so we asked them to put on a certain game since they had NFL Ticket.  After fumbling with multiple remotes and guides,  they tried to sell me that it was the ONLY game on.  IDIOTS!!!  We should have left right then.  \n\nWe decided to stay and use our deal voucher.  Upon presentation to the bartender, they acted confused and had to scramble to show us what was available.  The deal seemed pretty clear cut but they acted as if it was in foreign language.  What was listed on the deal was NOT offered by the restaurant. Ok, so we move forward.\n\nI asked about their beers (their taps are way off to the side and barely visible).  The bartender couldn't tell me what was on tap nor did they had a beer list (really?!).  He did offer samples, but if he can't tell us what's on tap, how am we supposed to order a sample?  He then proceeds to pour us three (very poor pours) samples...OF HIS CHOOSING!!!  I got up, walked to the end of the bar so I could see the tap handles, and ordered a couple beers.  They were good.\n\nThe food...first they have had a huge menu change.  It used to be based on burgers, not now.  It's a totally different concept, not a \""burger joint\"" which is what the name suggests and what we expected and purchased the deal.  Here we go again.  The bartender says they changed because there were multiple burger places in the area and more coming.  I heard a few customers complain that the \""build a burger\"" option was gone.  I guess that was a highlight...hard for me to see any now.  The food and appetizers, which came out randomly, were just ok.  And the desert...premade frozen thingy...not good!  Oh yeah, and milkshakes that were to be included with the deal...not offered anymore at this place.  \n\nAnd ambiance...the place seems cool and normally would've been nice but we were lucky enough to be there when an older woman was bitching (not complaining) about a baby crying.  It was mid day and the place had maybe four tables of people.  It's a baby for gosh sakes!!  Instead of apologizing and letting it go, this bartender spent in excess of 30 minutes sucking up to this old bag.  I have no kids and can tolerate an innocent child (yes parents should use common sense but).  I would've escorted this old hag out and saved my other patrons her annoying whining.  Instead he allowed his other customers to go unattended while he kissed her .....\n \nI could probably continue but you get the point...No, Nada, Never returning.  Waste of time.  Absolutely the worst experience!!!!"
1,"Update: I just had to give them 5 stars again!!! I've been here a lot since my first great experience and it has not let me down. The menu is not huge but they have the best bbq ribs and burgers around.  The bar and wait staff are awesome. It's definitely my favorite place in town for family dining, happy hour AND date night. I heard the breakfast is great too! This is a must try."
0,"My biggest gripe is the value and variety. The two v's, very important. The sandwiches are 7/8 dollars but don't come with anything. And all they have are salad and chips. Also, the sandwiches aren't that big. Tasty enough, but nothing all that special. I also had breakfast here one time, and, again, not bad but nothing special. So, I wouldn't be against going here if someone suggests it, but not my choice.\n\nMaybe I'll try the coffee bar and pastries."
0,"Anyone with a brain will instantly recognize that this place is not about the food AT ALL. It's about its function on the South Side; the Dream House for all the Ken and Barbie types. You will find Pittsburgh guido / yinzer OAFS eagerly paying through the hose for over-priced meat in hopes of wooing one of the many ex-sorority, Louis Vuitton bag hag bar WENCHES. For the poor OAFS who slobber over these WENCHES with their wallets, this watering hole is their surest spot to buy tuna. As for the WENCHES; it is the perfect place to parade the whitest teeth, highest heels, and blondest roots. This restaurant is the pole-dancing embodiment of what your average black and gold bleedin' yinzer believes to be upscale. Case in point, a hand-soap-offering attendant in the men's restroom; truly ridiculous........... just smacks of a naive pretentiousness that only the provincial mind-set of a South Side bar-barian would find 'classy'. I guess I'm not one for 'classy' restaurants anyway; they are always way too tacky."
0,"We ordered take out from here for dinner last night. \n\nAfter paying our $70 tab (3 soups, 2 rolls), we opened the containers up at home to be incredibly disappointed. The soups were just ok, not the same quality as the first time, not horrible but just OK. \n\nThe sushi is where we were REALLY pissed off. $15/roll to get 6 pieces of what looks like BUDGET SUSHI. We could have gone to Yume Sushi and gotten a kick ass awesome sushi roll (or two!) for that price but apparently here, it gets you a 6 piece baked (microwaved) rice roll with hardly any other ingredients smothered in \""spicy\"" (not) mayo sauce with the teensiest bit of roe sprinkled on top. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, I TOTALLY felt downright ROBBED on this meal and I am not a happy camper about it. The food quality for the prices charged is insane. \n\nI won't be back."
1,"It was a friend's birthday and she decided to celebrate here.  There were only 9 of us and we went on a Wednesday night, and it was my first time.\n\nFirst off, great ambience, and the staff was quite friendly.  Our service was good, and the food was excellent.  I indulged in their sashimi appetizer, which was fresh and quite tasty; definitely a great start.  Instead of the steak (I know, I know lol) I opted for a Kobe burger cooked medium rare, and I couldn't be happier (wish I could've finished it but at least I got to take the rest home ;P).  I sampled a few other things also off of everyone else's plate, such as the potato leek soup, and potato gnocchi in truffle sauce... that alone to me was worth it!  \n\nI really liked that they offered \""organic\"" items on their menu.  Kudos for that!\n\nAs a bonus, I actually just found out a friend was working there since I saw him bussing tables and told him it was my friend's birthday.  They came out with a beautiful dessert \""stone palette\"" with the words \""Happy Birthday\"" on it in chocolate.  The smores were awesome, as were the two types of ice cream/gelato and cake.  Well presented and super yummy.\n\nWould definitely dine here again. :)"
0,"Went here for lunch and took advantage of the all you can eat sushi deal.  The fish was not fresh, made me sick.  Do Not Eat Here!"

First of all, the room will be dramatic and the service will be exemplary.  Second, there will be ingredients you have never heard of presented in manners you never imagined.  Third, there will be a point in the meal where there are at least four plates resting in front of you and you'll have no idea where to start.  Fourth, chances are good that there will be at least one plate that leaves you scratching your head wondering \""what were they thinking?\""  Last of all - the other ten to fifteen plates will not only be delicious, they'll make you wonder \""why didn't anyone think of that before?\""\n\nUnderstanding that Twist is high risk and high reward in a city where a gamble is the very basis of the economy is part of the experience and while the reward may not come in the form of a financial windfall the cost of admission at the restaurant newly helmed by Ryuki Kawasaki comes with myriad rewards in the form of cuisine like no other in Sin City - a foie gras dish exploring both bitter and sweet, then bringing it to a peak with super-sweet ice cream only to follow-up with a firey finish being the most impressive example while a brandade dish marring salt and earth elegantly only to leave a sweet, vegetal note on the palate somewhat akin to pumpkin pie also wowed.  To the other end - the true risk taker of the evening came with dessert as the nearly unpalatably bitter grapefruit, champagne, and pepper cocktail was served front and center completely overwhelming the palate only to be followed by five additional sweets stimulating the rest of the palate and completing the vision.\n\nCertainly not a restaurant or meal for those happy to dine at a buffet in order to get back to the craps table Twist is a place to sit, think, enjoy the scenery and the service, and embrace the chef's vision - it is like no other place in Vegas, and all-in it remains my favorite restaurant in the city."
0,"First time ordering food from Marco's. We decided to do take out to test it out. Ordered the margarita pizza and baked ziti with meat sauce.\n\nThe pizza dough was soggy and was not cooked all the way through. I tasted fine, but was difficult to eat with out falling apart because you could not pick it up. This was the only pizza I've ever had that the crust and dough were not cooked enough to pickup. Of course when I make pizza at home on a pita this happens, but I paid Marco $13 for this so called pizza.\n\nThe baked ziti was very soupy like in consistency. Taked fine, but didn't look very appealing to eat. The meat sauce in side looked strange as their were bits of hard cut up meat pieces that at first I couldn't figure out what it was.\n\nThe problem is Marco's is that there are no less than 3 very italian restaurants within 2 miles (Vito's 3 blocks away, Nicks about 2 miles away, and Spinatos about 3 block across the street) so if you want customers to come back, the food must be better. \n\nUnfortunately, the food is much worse and is probably why when I walked in the place to pick up my takeout it was pretty emply at 7pm. If you go into any of the other places I mention at 7am, you have to wait about 10-20 to get in.\n\nPerhaps it is time to call \""Restaurant Impossible\"" to this place out before it goes out of business. Seems like they could make it work, but Marco thinks he's a much better chef that he really is and may be the only one who loves his own cooking!\n\nEven if I had a Groupon I wouldn't come back!"
1,We really liked the food. Steak and bean burger was great! Waitress took forever getting back to us when we were trying to pay our check though.
0,"New to the Surprise area, used to getting and paying for 4 full pedicures for my family. We went into the shop and were told there is a 10% off services if we did Mani and Pedi's together. My dad had the best person there. My mom had the owner's wife and she did a horrible job, didn't clip toe nails short enough, argued with my mom on why she could not shorten them. Polish was messy and left on the toe skin around the nail, heels were left ragged and looked like she had never been to get her feet done. My son is 13, they left his toe nails ingrown and too long. Scrubbed so hard with the loofah he had blisters on his feet. When it was my turn, I went for ingrown toe nails and left with them still hurting. The guy sort of trimmed my toe nails. When I asked for shorter, he told me they were fine? Skin around my toes were left with clip marks, polish was left on my skin, no clean up with a brush in polish remover. At the end of the pedicures, the owner did not show me the totals where she had removed the 10% discount, gave a number out of the air. Good business starts with being honest with your clients! Shop is dirty, smells like mildew and rotten food. Doors are dirty, floors slippery, dust and cobwebs hanging from ceiling. Health Department needs to visit this shop. It's disgusting!!! Don't go here, they are sloppy and only want the $$."
0,"Coffee cake is always good. I usually order my usual, country fried chicken steak and eggs with gravy...:) Vegas doesn't have much breakfast places...this suffice the cravings....nothing fancy...more like your fancier version of denny's."
0,"I'm rating this compared to other Dunkin Donuts I've been to.  I love the atmosphere with the fireplace and bookcases--very cozy compared to many other Dunkin Donuts.  They have a kosher menu which appeals to the neighborhood it's located in and makes it pretty unique, though personally I'd prefer the meat options too. The staff there are always friendly. The problem I have with this place is that they are always so incredibly so that there is a line no matter what time of day I go.  Often they don't even have both registers open and some staff look like they don't know what to do with themselves.  And when they get overwhelmed they start screwing up people's orders.  I typically order just a black coffee on my way to work and I'm usually in a hurry so having some efficiency is pretty important to me.  Especially when you have to pay the parking meters!\n\nUpdate:  I'm taking this down another notch. Recently I was there and the person serving me was downright rude.  First she makes a comment that it was so unusual I ordered a large black coffee, because \""women never drink black coffee.\""  Really?!  Then even after making that comment she gives me a medium.  I say \""Excuse me, but I believe this is a medium.\""  First she ignores me, then after I try to get her attention again, she says \""Yep, it is.\""  So I then have to add \""So, do you remember that I ordered a large and that's what I paid for?\""  Then she grabs it from me and fixes it but is obviously pissy and annoyed about it and not apologetic at all.  If there were another Dunkin Donuts nearby I would never go to this location as the service is so awful.  I've never had such terrible service at a Dunkin Donuts before and I've been to many all over the country."
1,"I've never been to this B-Dub's until my fiance and I were craving food while at Fry's Electronics down the street. My fiance wanted chicken strips so I pulled up BWW on my Yelp app. I'm a fan of hot wings and BWW in general. I like the atmosphere and sitting in the bar area is always a best bet for quick and friendly service typically.\n\nWe sat in the bar and we were quickly greeted by our waitress, who was talkative and nice. She asked me about my tattoo and we discussed local tattoo parlors as well. So for service I am going to say 5 stars for our waitress, but I can't remember her name.\n\nNext is food. Normally I order either boneless wings or normal wings. It's kind of a no-brainer. I mean, you are coming to BWW. But their potato wedges are really good too. On this visit I had a cheeseburger and let me tell you why. You see, there are a lot of fancy-schmancy burger places around town that will make you a burger with different types of sauces and rubs. They'll charge you an arm and a leg for them too. At BWW you can add any wing sauce or wing rub to your burger. Maybe the burger isn't top-notch quality, BUT you are getting a very interesting burger combo for a much cheaper price than at a burger joint that will upcharge you for EVERYTHING.\n\nI got my burger cooked with the chipotle rub and it was delicious. I also asked for a small container of the chipotle rub to sprinkle on my french fries - so good too. You also get a selection of cheeses at BWW and I tend to go with the pepperjack cheese for an extra kick. \n\nSo, it does pay to take a look at the menu at a place even if they are well known for a certain type of food. I'm sure I'll be back for the wings eventually."
0,"OMG. Over priced food... Please walk to Denny's and buy yourself the $6 grand slam instead of paying $16 for it here!\n\nHorrible food.... OK service... sticky tables... the list goes on. \n\nAnyways, don't waste your money here! Go down the hall and go to the buffet... same price, all you can eat!"
1,"Have been here three times and enjoyed it each time.  Sharing the raclette wheel is best with a group of four.  The salads, sides and desserts are creative and consistent.  Bring your own wine."
0,"I'd give more stars if I was actually ever able to try anything here.\n\nI've made three trips to this establishment to try their Dole Whip and all three of those times they were not serving dole whip. I must say it is disappointing that the availability of this product is non-existent.\n\nNot only that, some of the staff have very unfriendly attitudes. Not a great impression for your new customers. You could work on just being friendly/polite and give some information perhaps when you might ever be selling some of your product. Instead you just say you don't have it with a cold tone and call it a day."

1,I love love love Iron Chef! The place itself is small but spacious and decorated very nicely. The staff are all very polite and attentive. The quality of the food is amazing and the happy hour prices are unbelieveably cheap. It's a great atmosphere and I consider this my favorite sushi joint in town :)
1,"Was super impressed with the fish tacos. Same taste and fell as cali. Also the 3 rolled tacos were amazing as well. Service was good, friendly staff and love option of having beer. Didn't like the bar being separated from dinner room. All in all great food, and great healthy choices."
0,"The only thing this place had going for it was a nice dessert buffet. Most of the food was bland, as if it was catering to the elderly. Had a few buffet staples like prime rib, snow crabs and shrimp... but everything else just stunk.\n\nWe did this through the $59 for unlimited 24 hour access to buffets. This is one you can SKIP! Go to Paris or Planet Hollywood's buffet, and stay away from this place."
1,Great shakes!  What a cool lookin' place.
1,"In 79 reviews, no one has given this place below 3 stars.  That should tell you all you need to know.  Consistently good bar food in a quiet, pub-like environment. Service is always consistent, too.  Nothing fancy - but that's perfect for me.  Go for the London Broil sammy at lunch.  Reasonably priced and delicious.\n\nIf I had a magic wand and could change a few things about this restaurant, I'd focus on parking and adding more tables.  Street parking in a quiet neighborhood can be limited.  I've been here a handful of times when there has been a line out the door with people waiting for a table.  Both faults, however, are incredibly hard to control."
0,"The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here."
0,Food good service substandard at best. If u have lots of time to waste it will ok i guess
0,"Checked out this place from the groupon last night. Friday night at 750 most tables were full ONE server. ordered our food, the the wings that were small and undercooked with generic sauce. got some garlic bread that we did enjoy. we had our drinks and all 3 cups were empty with some ice and I put them at the end of the table hoping the ONE server would notice, we had to call her over for refills, she said for which ones...... (I should have said only the EMPTY ones) ALL of our dishes from the garlic bread and wings sat on the table the ENTIRE time. we ordered the White pizza and realized when we got it there was no ricotta on it. I didnt want to complain I was tired of this place. The table behind us never had their pizza put in and they sat after us, and barely got their pizza as we were talking out the door. OIL everywhere on the pizza. That should not happen with white pizza. Here is the kicker, from about 820pm (FRIDAY NIGHT) they turned away 3 groups of people because \""they had NOTHING left in the kitchen\"" Really? you put out a groupon not preparing for the influx of customers?!?!??! Those people will NEVER come back when a pizza place is OUT OF FOOD at 845. such an embarressment. Will not come back again"
1,"Big portions, great food, crowded as all get out.\n\nTip:  Get a Total Rewards Platinum Card and skip the line...also thumb your nose at the people in the long line as you pass on through as though you are Thurston Howell playing through at the Pebble Beach Golf Course.\n\nGet the Fried Chicken Benedict or the Chicken and Waffles.  The Benedict is a lot of freakin food, and gets cold quick if you don't hoover it.  The Chicken and Waffles seems to hold together fairly well.  Don't think this is a classy joint...because it isn't.  This is a spit on the floor and curse at your friends kind of place...but it has great food.  Lots of freakin kids too.  Also...it is in the Quad, which means it is the best thing in the Quad....because the Quad is the 9th Circle of Hell."
1,"Daily Dose is hands down my favorite restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. I began going there when it first opened for brunch and was highly impressed by the multiple options they have available for the ways in which you can order Eggs Benedict. You can get them with roasted red pepper, asparagus, chorizo or my personal favorite...thinly sliced prime rib. In addition, they give you the option to order them \""DD style\"" in which they replace the  english muffin and hollandaise sauce with a biscuit and gravy. \n\nAfter enjoying their brunch on multiple occasions, I became curious about their happy hour. Not only do they have the most convenient happy hour schedule (4-8pm!) but their menu options are amazing as well. Unlike their morning hours during which there tends to be quite a wait time for a table, there is always availability during dinner time and the atmosphere is very comfortable. I don't think I have ever had anything from Daily Dose that was not to like.  Their sangria is delicious also :) \n\nSome of my  favorite menu items: \n\nButternut Squash Ravioli \n\nPrime Rib Eggs Benedict \n\nTacos (any)\n\nVeggie Dip\n\nChicken Nachos (their salsa is great) \n\nPanko Crusted Calamari\n\nCilantro, Jalapeno & Edamame Hummus\n\nChocolate Cake MMMmmm!"

0,"I stayed here to view the timeshare package. They were rude and wouldn't let me view by myself. I wanted to tour but the sales staff wouldn't allow it and threaten to charge me. The security attempted to try to take me out and Andy the sales manager stated that he would call the police. I debated their policy regarding that \""couples\"" had to view the timeshare being that I can purchase on my own.  Never staying here again."
1,"Ok, what are you expecting if you are paying less than 45 a night? middle of strip and in sin city? Go look somewhere else if you want luxury. This place was clean, easy access, in the middle of all. And their non smoking section was GREAT. We didn't have enough time or energy to go around the hotel as we wanted to check other legends. \n\nOf course we had an incredible view to the roof of 2nd floor, but who cares if we spent most of our time out. I'd give it one more star if they had a faster check in system."
1,"First of all, it is very hard to find this place partly because of the construction going on in the complex.  Don't give up though because they do a good job.  The place is definitely family owned and very cozy.  When I was there, there were 2 girls and 2 guys working.  They love chatting with customers.  I did a pedi with french tip + design AND pink & white full set for my hands.....I think I paid around $80 for the whole thing.  Usually, my nails are kinda short so when they put the pink & white, you can see the line underneath.  The wonderful thing about this place is, they were able to cover the lines with really perfect designs which totally won me over.  Really, if you want nice designs, this place is it.\n\n*Decor = cute\n*Price = average\n*Service = great if you are in the mood to chat"
1,I bought a used BMW this year and began taking it in for some service and accessories. My service writer is Jennifer Mahoney. I highly recommend her for your BMW service. She is good at her job and rolls out the red carpet for her customers.
0,"I spent a lot of money over the past few weeks ordering from this place. I ordered from them because they are a member of eat24hours.com and accept paypal which is something I need...Anyways their pizza is average, their appetizers are hit and miss. Some times they taste stale. The garlic balls are good. THE MAIN REASON THEY GET 1 STAR is that I've never had a major issue with a delivery until today. Normally it takes them 60-90 minutes to deliver when I'm told 45-60 minutes. Today I ordered food at 1:18pm and at 2:20 the food still isn't here. I find out what's up and the delivery driver hasn't left yet... then at 2:45 I ask why it still isn't here and he says he rang the doorbell and nobody answered... LIES. They are average, and overpriced and I was spending a lot of money weekly with them just for the convienance. NOT ANYMORE. They don't value delivery orders or their customers.  Save your money and go someplace worth the extra money because this place is not."
1,Came in for some sushi and was pleasantly surprised how good everything was. The portions were large and our server was excellent.
1,"This venue is mind-blowing!! Music, booze, food, and bowling all in one roof... it definitely can't get any better than that.\n\nCame in to see The Roots and their set was ridiculous!! The stage is quite small but wasn't too crowded. There are also about 5 bars throughout the place serving Brooklyn brews on tap.  How dope is that though?!\n\nWhat I'm most excited about Brooklyn Bowl: Bromberg Brothers serving Blue Ribbon fried chicken right around my neighborhood till four in the morning.  Make sure to eat it with hot sauce and honey... foodporn!!\n\nBowling alleys on two floors with one overlooking the stage.  I'm not much of a bowler but I'd actually try it out in this place.  Not sure if you need show tickets to bowl when someone's performing.  They also stream the concert at the front of the alley so players can see what's going on at the stage while having a game.  Then again, why trade an epic live performance with bowling?!\n\nOverall, Brooklyn Bowl is certainly one of Las Vegas' awesome music venues.  I pick this over Boulevard Pool/House of Blues any day."
1,"Found myself on the Westside and of course had to sample some well reviewed and well rated Pho! This is very nice Pho and fortunately for me I have four I ranked slightly higher that are closer to me in the East Valley, as this is very far to go for Pho. VERY nice broth, lots of meat (although a couple of pieces were a little tough) served by the little Vietnamese Lady who obviously is responsible for its delicate flavor. Beats out lots of very well regarded \""Pho Joints,\"" quite handily. Nice surprise and very close to my #3 ranked Pho Phind!"
0,"Bleh. First, any \""Mexican\"" restaurant with ground beef on the menu is not authentic. Second, this stuff is not fresh. I asked whether they could cook my steak for the steak burrito medium, and the waiter said the steak was \""precooked.\""  So, I asked for steak and shrimp fajitas. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium, and it was harder than an old sponge (nasty). I ate here last night and asked for medium rare steak fajitas, and they came out very rare (still mooing). Rule of thumb: do not order steak from here.  Also, buyer beware!  My coworker literally could not put her fork through the tamale she ordered ... Someone overheated a frozen tamale!"
1,Nice selection of books and an awsome local history section. Helpful staff know their way around the stacks.
0,"I went here because of a massive craving for shellfish and it is not far from my house. I was sadly disappointed in almost every component of this experience.\n\nService: Honestly some of the worst service I've ever had. After ordering a cocktail, I was very disappointed when after 20 minutes my server returned to my table, noticed I didn't have my drink yet and said \""No one brought your drink?\"" It is a huge pet peeve when servers do not take responsibility for their tables and it seemed this is what he was doing. My drink ended up coming, but a few minutes after my food. Two other factors played into this horrible service experience. My table was about three tables away from the computer the servers used to ring up orders, and I heard one of the servers very loudly talk about how he was \""screwed out of a tip\"" by a table. Very unprofessional. Finally, the manager of the restaurant did not really seem to care about his restaurant. He stood near the bar socializing with a young woman the entire time I was there, not once did he leave to check on tables or do any work. The only reason I even knew he was the manager was because the servers kept coming up to him with questions.\n\nFood: My food was served cold. Despite being in a steam pot...and it was all incredibly over-cooked. It was like they had steamed my shellfish and then let it sit in the steamer for hours before it was given to me. Very disappointed."
0,"Trendy look, typical go go boys and lots of people standing and drooling over said go go boys. Music wasn't amazing if I recall, but mostly b/c it was trancy - not my thing. A good place to get a drink and get the night started but I would not have this be a destination bar again. In fact, I woulndn't feel at all upset if I didn't get back here the next time I'm in Vegas. That said, it's connected to 8 1/2 (and there's just the one cover charge), so if you go there (which per my review you might given the right circumstance), you might check this place out just because. Hey, at least you get to see the cool piranhas they have!"
0,"I thought the whole idea for the cold stone was to mix things with the ice cream you order. Didn't happen when I was there. The girl barely touched it, threw it in the cup, & called for the next in line.  Not impressed."
0,"I usually order from another place but they don't deliever to my work place. I gave Chop Wok a try after a suggestion from a fellow employee.  I ordered 2 Shrimp Dishes.  Both I felt were disappointing and for what I payed I was expecting more.\nI got mostly a box full of veggies smothered in gravy  with 4 shrimp,  and a carton of overcooked noodles 3 shrimp and about 50 watercrests. ( not that I dont like them it's just it was almost all there was in the box with the noodles. )\n\nI think from now on Ill stick to my local place instead and bring their food with me to work."
1,"The meal at The Mission was AMAZING!  The only thing I regret is not having more room in my stomach to eat more.  \n\nWe started with the Grilled Street Corn and the Crispy Cola Pork.  Both were flavorful, unique, and worthy of being ordered again.  For my entree, I ordered the Sopa de Elote (I wasn't too hungry) and my husband ordered the Chorizo Porchetta.  True to the starters, these entrees were unlike anything we had tried before, and they left us wanting more.\n\nWe ended with the pumpkin bread pudding which can only be described as God's gift to bread pudding.  It was rich, decadent, and had me wanting to like the plate.  \n\nThis place is a must try!"
0,"We arrived here yesterday. The rooms are very nice, but the beds are awful!!!! We took 3 separate rooms and all of them had the same problem. It seems like these mattresses had been used forever.... Also, the doors are so heavy that we are constantly concern about our kids fingers; even for an adult its hard to open them. I would not recommend this hotel. Never coming back... We looked for a nice hotel w out cigaret smoke and casino, but this experience is not worth it...."
1,"We came on a Friday night and ordered 2 AYCE for $14 (Used the $10 LivingSocial valued at $20) Each dinner is 13.99. Total 30.25\n\n- Across from Hard Rock Hotel. \n- Our server, Angela, said that bc we didn't print our LivingSocial, They can't accept it. WTF. After realizing that it was far-fetched, I told her you can just take a picture of the coupon. She agreed. Management fail. \n- Aside from the initial confusion, This MBBQ offers great options! They serve more than the basics. Tofu is a huge plus for me, along with baby carrots. But pizza toppings? HAHA. Whatever floats your boat. \n- Chef can provide you with optional white rice with your meal. I saw one of their employees stir-fry their rice! Looked great, but not a option for customers. HAHA. Worth a shot to ask ;). \n- Food quality was still fresh! Great to know esp if you eat during dinner.\n- Like most MBBQ restaurants, they did not give us fried wantons and soup.\n- Nice interior design."
1,"This afternoon Rand H. and I stopped in for an early dinner. It was nice and cool inside. There was a booth available to our left as we stepped in the door. We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno & shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.\n\nNo more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me. (The fish was served flayed open with head and tail still attached.)\nONE WORD:  Yummy! It was tasty as can be, and I was glad, as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food. I highly recommend this spot and It's a shame Alexander and Nader had such a soggy humid experience here. It seems to have been fixed as this was not the case on my first visit here this evening. \n\nOh, and I liked the old photos of things like Poncho Villa's Wanted poster and other early 1900's historical Mexican events."
1,It was good but im always loyal to boiling crab though. not bad for something different!
1,"My boyfriend and I went to Kaya on one of the first ridiculously, awfully hot days in June.  It was our three-year anniversary (of dating).  I would've loved to sit outside, but their tables weren't shaded and even in the early evening, it would've been too hot to sit along the sidewalk.  So inside we went.\n\nThe decor was really cool, and comfortable.  The Caribbean vibe flows throughout the restaurant with the music, the lights, the shape of the chairs, the bar - like a classy tiki lounge?  You'll feel like you're on vacation.\n\nOur server was great - I can't remember his name, unfortunately, but he wore glasses and I think he had a ponytail.  He was friendly and casual, quick with a joke and a recommendation.  We started a carafe of Rum Runners - a carafe will get you three drinks for the price of two, so do it - and the drinks were delicious.  The Rum Runner has two kinds of rum, blackberry brandy, banana liqueur, orange juice, pineapple juice, and grenadine - it tasted and looked just as good as it sounds.  And we were still able to drive afterward.\n\nFor the meal, we began with the Jamaican Jerk Wings with Cilantro Cream sauce, and they were fan-tas-tic.  Some of the best wings I've had anywhere, ever.  They are spicy, and the skin is crispy, and they were just luscious.  The cilantro cream sauce provided the perfect balance.  I'd order this again anytime.\n\nWe then split the Tropical Paella - they split the entree onto two plates for us - and it was quite good as well.  Less stunning than the wings, less creative perhaps, but well executed, tasty, and satisfying nonetheless.  The seafood in the paella was well-cooked, and the taste of the pineapple was outstanding.\n\nWe were still a tiny bit hungry, so we got calamari instead of dessert.  The calamari came with jicama, radicchio, coconut, and peanuts, in a sesame-banana vinaigrette.  The flavors were undeniably tropical, the calamari was crispy, and we picked at it long after we were full, just to get one more sweet, crunchy bite.\n\nThere are some pricey options here, and some very moderately priced items.  They also have happy hour on weekdays, so I think you could easily eat here without breaking the bank.  I'd call this an easy 4 star review....edging toward 4 1/2....I bet they could break the 5 star barrier if we had one more great dinner here!"
0,"The second time in a month that I went there and they ran out of Green tea ice cream. They should know by now that they sell a lot of those. So stock it!!!! \nTonight was packed. So I decided to order to-go instead. No more ice cream, fine, I'll get just regular milk green tea. I gave them a card and they don't accept a card under $10. I said my bf is picking me up I'll get cash from him. He said \""I can't put an order in before you pay. It will take only a few second to make it\"" yeah of course it's fast to make it but I waited like 10mins to get someone to take my order. \nI was craving for something sweet and quick. If I had time to sit down, I wouldn't come to this place. Every time I come here service sucks. Last time I ordered two appetizers, greentea noodle, two glasses of tea. And they forgot my apps!"
1,Baseball in uptown Charlotte makes me excited to be a Charlotte resident. BB&T park is a fantastic location near the new Romare Bearden park and the Panther's stadium. If taking the light rail just pop off at the 3rd St/Convention Center stop and its a less than five minute walk to the ballpark.\n\nI was impressed with the range of food options from Queen City Q to froyo there was an option for those that don't want a pretzel or hot dog. \n\nif coming with a group your tickets can come pre-loaded with dollars to spend at the ballpark- thanks office! :)\n\nI heard parking was easily found for around $4. Beers are pricey but local craft brews are the same price as a Bud Light so score a premium beer if that's your style.\n\nI'm glad this stadium is here and I hope people continue to frequent games even after the shine of a new stadium has worn off.
1,"Delicious cocktails.  Chill environment.  Great service.  Clean venue.\n\nCame here on a Wednesday night after a friend came into town from LA.  The door is not that tricky to find if you have any common sense (if you don't, it will make for a funny sight for those inside).\n\nThe menu contains a list of great cocktails and beers.  I tried the Summer Sazzy and the girls had The Links.  Overall the drinks were a bit strong, but they tasted great! The bartender was very nice and showed passion in creating the drinks.\n\nThere was a live DJ playing super chill deep house (my favorite) which flowed perfectly with the environment.\n\nOverall this place gets 5 stars and I will for sure be going back again in the near future.\n\nCheers!"
0,"Not really impressed with the food here. The service is just so-so. \n\nCame here in February with my boyfriend. I ordered the shrimp risotto and he ordered a pizza. Came out in a timely fashion, but the taste was very very subpar. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy his pizza, but the major downfall of the meal was the shrimp risotto. The shrimp had a fishy taste to it (not altogether too normal), and the risotto was overcooked and mushy. The sauce also was very sweet, which was unappealing to the palette, especially when combined with fishy-tasting shrimp and mealy risotto. \n\nThe only thing I really, truly enjoyed was the complimentary bread before the meal which is served hot and with extra virgin olive oil and a cracked pepper seasoning. That's about it. \n\nOverall, the meal was not worth $50.. Won't be back anytime soon."
0,place is very clean:) Banana Republic is the only store I really go to here.
0,"I will never use this company again, they are horrible. The apartment I moved into was not cleaned properly and when I asked why they said because the cleaning lady doesn't clean that part?! What? So window seals and base boards do not need to be cleaned. They take weeks to fix anything or they tell you they can send someone and you can pay the bill. They are not helpful at all. They purposely ignore your phone calls, but answer your emails very unfriendly. The apartment I rented needs serious help and they have sent people to do horrible jobs at fixing it and then gave me the materials and told me to keep it up by fixing it myself instead of replacing what needs to be replaced. Never, ever rent from them. They have no idea what customer service entails. Even if you find an apartment that you think is a great price, and they are friendly and helpful in the beginning, do not do it. My friend in a completely different apartment, but rented through them, is having the same issues (we rented at the same time). If you are going to believe any yelp review, believe this one. Save yourself time, money and stress, DO NOT rent from here!"
1,"I was a little worried about the bad reviews, but we went anyway as we felt the menu was worth exploring.  The food was fantastic!\n\nThe location was a little strange...it's in the lobby of an office building, and there was street construction going on all around it.  However, once inside, the service was very attentive and the food was fabulous.  I had the cheese plate as an app (choice of 3) and the portions were huge.  Actually, as much as I love cheese, I wasn't prepared for the size of the portions.   A little cheese goes a long way.   Their wine selection by the glass was good and we all ordered fish dishes and everyone was pleased.  The only ding I would give them is for the type of cuisine they are doing, the portions are too big.  I'm sure most people wouldn't complain but when you get into this type/price range of restaurant, you want to savor a few courses, which means each course needs to be size-appropriate.  Since I'm not from Pittsburgh, I don't know if it's because diners expect the size or what.  \n\nEither way, I'd go back next time in in Pittsburgh."
1,"Walked by on our first day in Montreal.  Made a mental note and returned the next morning for a quick bite en route to bota bota.\n\nTheir almond croissant is unlike any other I've tasted.  It's got this creamy paste thing in the center that was just out of this world.  If there was a way for me to ensure that the flaky crusts would remain fresh and crisp, I'd definitely import a few dozen of their goods back to nyc!!"
0,"The worst dining experience I have had in years.  If I were not with 5 friends, though they were agonizing over the service, I think I would have gone nuts.  The pri fixe dinner portions were tiny, then they refused to serve dessert, and would not give us any break in the price.  Service was almost non existent, extremely slow.  You won't find me ever going back."
0,"Went here for drinks on a Saturday night and the place was not extremely busy but for some reason it was like pulling teeth to have my beer filled.  Maybe the bartenders were having an off night but after 5 minutes of the bartenders walking by i had to flag them down for a cocktail.  \n\nWe ordered 12 of the boneless wings that came out extremely quickly...maybe 2 quickly.  The chicken totaly dry, the sauce didn't even seem present.  Perhaps said chicken had been from a previous order or cooked before ordered. \n\nIf you're just looking for a place to watch a game and do not care about service, food, and drinks this would be a great choice as they did have many games on."
0,"This is an \""OK\"" Greek place, but no where near the best. Our last few trips have been a big let down and I forgot to call an tell them so I'll tell all: the salads are $10 for a small portion of ragged old lettuce and a few pieces of chicken here an there. The gyro my husband had was also skimping on portion and the pita was hard! Their meals are also pricey in my opinion and you'll get crap fries, compared to the alternative My Big Fat Greek."
0,"I am picky about frozen yogurt places.  I cannot find one as good as Yogurtland which I visited in Colorado.  Orange Leaf has nice people working there but if you ask to sample something they actually fill the little sample cup for you and stand right next to you when you eat it.  It is uncomfortable.  One of the best things about going to a yogurt place like this one is to try all the great flavors.  It was awkward to say the least and out of 6 different frozen yogurt places I have tried this is the only one I have ever felt awkward in.  The frozen yogurt and topping selection are up there with most in the Madison, WI area but not as good as Yogurtland.  The prices aren't too bad either compared to others, I think a little less even.  For overall experience I would go to Cherry Berry in the area."
0,"After going to Hot'n'spicy Crawfish, I wanted to give this other seafood chain a shot.  I ordered crawfish just like I did at Hot'n'Spicy.  I was flabbergasted to find these little pip-squeaks with tiny, itty-bitty tails with what appeared 1 or 1.5 cm of meat.  WTF?  The crawfish at Hot'n'spicy had at least 5 or 6 cm of meat.  The waiter said they were out-of-season.  Why sell them then?  I was blown away.  I thought I was in the twilight zone.  I would have given this place one star, but the waiter let me sub shrimp.  The shrimp was okay but there wasn't much sauce for dipping.  When I had the Hot'n'spicy Crawfish, the bag was filled with a thick, brothy sauce that I literally just ate like a soup, and it was mind-blowing.  The layout was better than Hot'n'spicy which is too cramped but there was a fly buzzing around which made it feel gross along with the stupid grafitti they allow you to put up all over the place."
1,"What did we do before God invented Stein Mart?\n\nOkay, God didn't invent Stein Mart, but their prices are truly divine.  We have been in this store several times or more a week before the Holidays and it seemed like the prices were \""going out of business\"" like. \n\nI watched my spouse buy about five items, and between the coupons on her Stein Mart's customer card and the coupons from the mail & circular, I was sure they were going to pay her in the end.  \n\nThe prices are that good.  Really!  But, bring your coupons and sign up for the Stein Mart customer card"
0,"Out of the Cirque shows that I have seen (Zarkana, Ka, Mystere, MJ-1) this certainly had the least acrobatic ability on display. The songs didnt really transition all that well. The beginning of the show is really dull and even as a Beatles fan, it was hard to see the entertainment value. They left out songs like \""Love me do\"", \""Hard days night\"" which could have provided for a more up-tempo experience. Listening to the songs at the beginning, it was almost like someone read a buzzfeed article about the top 10 beatles songs you must know and then based the show around it. \n\nEach of the Cirque shows fare better than this one. I am disappointed, as a Beatles fan, I am very very disappointed."
0,"This store is very dirty, and has lots it's attention to detail over the last year. It's obvious to me that poor management has destroyed the morale and drive of the employees who used to take pride in this store. I won't be sad to see this store losed and replaced with a Cardenas.\n\nThe management has lost sight in CUSTOMER SERVICE. It has definitely carried over throughout the store and employees, they just don't care. High prices and poor customer service ....means I will never shop here and I will tell all of my friends and family the same."
0,"My first night at the Flamingo, I won a nice jackpot and decided to call it a night. When I got up to the room I discovered the TV didn't work. I tried to call the front desk- and the phone didn't work!! The bedside clock didn't work, either. The bathroom hadn't been updated at all and (surprise!) the fan didn't work. As a result, the paint on the cabinets was bubbled and peeling and the faceplate on the fan was rusty. Overall- the bathroom seemed pretty grubby. \nDon't gamble on the Flamingo- it's not a winner."
1,"The best comic book store in town hands down. Great selection, awesome staff. Have been a regular for years and that is not going to stop any time soon"
0,"Just under $9.00 for a combo #2 Pork Burrito, rice & beans with a medium Melon drink.  The Burrito was dry, meat greasy, beans runny and only a few spoonfulls of pico de gallo in the condiment tray.  No Salsa verde or any red sauce at all.  Staff was surly and made me feel like I bothered them to eat there.\n\nWhy didn't I read the Yelp reviews before stopping in ..."
1,"Animal Shelters are usually depressing places, but the first thing I noticed when I came here was a lack of an overwhelming depressing vibe. The dog area was difficult to find (follow the signs! keep following them - and if you get lost ask in the main office) but once we made it there it was a clean series of small buidlings where the dogs wer ein spacious kennels. The volunteers and staff were all eager to help and it being a Saturday they were running back and forth between people.  You could tell that the volunteers were hoping each dog that they let out of the kennel would have  a home by the end of the day. \n\nIf you are looking at adopting a second dog, the staff encourages you to bring your current dog. There is plenty of space and the energy of the place is very calm; I normally wouldn't advise bringing in a dog to a kennel but here there are plenty of places \n\nWe went in to look at the dogs, but ended up deciding on adopting a kitten instead. The staff saw me looking at cats while my husband and I debated the various dogs and wisely asked if I wanted to hold one of the kittens and then recommended getting a kitten if we already had a dog. Couldn't have been happier with the experience. There is a bit of a wait time, to fill out paperwork and pay but considering how busy it was I forgave the time. \n\nWe came back the next day to pick up the kitten we adopted (they only fix the animals once they know they are going home with someone) and the staff was very efficent  and were genuinely happy to see animals go home with people. \n\n-Diffcult to find dog area (go inside any fo the buildings - the staff will direct you and there are signs..it's just a longer walk than you expect). \n\n-Clean with a very chill vibe. There is nothing depressing about this place.  You could bring your current dog and there are plenty of places you could take them for \""chill\"" time if they got excited or upset. \n\n-There were not many kittens, although a bunch of cats. Granted, considering I adopted one of the kittens and the other people there were adopting kittens it may just been a good day to be a kitten at the Animal Foundation.  \n\n- Very reasonable prices. This includes all their shots to date and spay/neuter services. \n\nMedium, aduit dogs - $105\nSmall dogs & puppies - $155\nCats & Kittens - $80\n\nI don't think I will ever go to a pet store again, not with how great an experience this was."
0,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nI went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever. \n\nI know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express. What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months. Dry and flavorless. \n\nThe service was also slow. They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check.\n\nI won't be going back."
1,"Love the cosmopolitan and have been to Holsteins a couple of times.  It has a fun and casual decor (hot pink cow in front) matched with a really nice looking bar.  \n\nSat at the bar both times.  The bartenders were friendly and suggestive without being too intrusive.  They have a great beer selection and will help recommend one if you want to try something new.  Although I usually like ordering specialty cocktails at places like this, I noticed that they had bubble-gum vodka (one of my favorites) so the bartender made me a  bubble-gum martini that was delicious! It was pink and girly...definitely what I was in the mood for. \n\nFor food I had the duck 'street tacos'. I love anything and everything with duck, but then add foie gras, and truffle cream and stuff it into a crispy tortilla? yuuummmm! \n\nAlso ordered the Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Its a perfect size portion (so you can eat it all and be guilt-free). I just happen to be a mac-n-cheese connoisseur, so I've had my share of cheesy noodles. This one is really good with the lobster and truffle cream, but not my favorite. However the dish comes with a mini lobster BLT that is so good I would definitely order it again. (You can only get this little mini blt with the mac, it's not a menu item on its own). \n\nHolsteins is a cool hang-out spot.  Not just an ordinary burger joint, they have really creative things on the menu that you wouldn't expect. Will definitely come back, there are still so many things I want to try!"
0,"I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation,  even they can screw it up if they don't pay attention to detail, and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a better cup at Martys Market for crying out loud!"
0,"In a year that has so far been defined by culinary episodes of grand disappointment, Gordon Bierch doesn't fail to fail - in fact, it just may be the king of the worst.\n\nA recent happy-hour visit to the Boca Park eatery had me doing something I almost never do -completely reject of the entire meal.\n\nAlong with my micro-brew selection, I ordered an Asian themed trio of appetizers, which featured Shrimp, Egg Rolls and Potstickers. After a small sampling of each of the three offerings, I was literally so disgusted that I pushed the plate away.\n\nTo begin with, there was no plate presentation. I likened it to walking through an art gallery, looking at blank walls. The Egg Rolls were cut at a bias (yea art) and the Potstickers were covered with a trail of Ponzu and Mustard Sauce (but we'll get to that later). Otherwise, there was not even a simple piece of Kale to offset the distinctively bland looking trio on a plain white plate.\n\nShrimp - by par the \""best\"" offering of the three. The shrimp looked and tasted like boxed, frozen, breaded 40-60 sized shrimp that I think were prepared in a microwave. Even the delightfully refreshing Sweet Chili Sauce did little to detract from the bland taste and pasty bread coating.\n\nEgg Rolls - I am not sure who \""discovered\"" this specific recipe, but they should consider a career change immediately. The rolls were stuffed with chicken and some sort of brown sauce that one could not even distinguish what flavor it was suppose to add (or subtract) from the dish. Each bite was overwhelmingly dominated by an unsavory chalky taste and a not-at-all faint aroma of frying oil.\n\nPotstickers - I would like to say I could tell you what the Potstickers tasted like, but the trail of Mustard Sauce was so powerful I could barely wash the taste from my mouth with the bitterness of my micro-brew. The sauce is extreme, to say the least, and could easily impart it flavor with as little as a drop on each Potsticker. Instead, the kitchen decided to drown each Potsticker with almost a teaspoon worth of this disgusting concoction. I wish I knew what the chef was trying to accomplish with his tragedy, but if you are unfortunate enough to try this one out for yourself, I can tell you a spoonful of the Sweet Chili sauce straight to the mouth will help in your recovery.\n\nThe only reason Gordon Bierch gets 2 stars instead of 1 is entirely due to the micro-brew Pilsner I had, it was admittedly pretty good.\n\nPerhaps the best way to express how utterly disappointing Gordon Bierch is, would be tell you that, after I left, I went down the road to The Yard House in Red Rock where I was treated to two beautiful and savory works of culinary art from their happy-hour menu - at just about the same price.\n\nBeing a two star and not a one, I will dare to adventure again to this establishment for its micro-brew - and to give the chef one more chance."

0,"Was visiting Edinburgh for a night and the next morning we decided to go for a wander around to find somewhere to have a decent breakfast. And so we unfortunately came upon Loudons. The ordering system was like being in a canteen but with restaurant prices. We were hungry after a great night out in Edinburgh though so we decided to persist. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Ham, or the \""eggs beni\"" as the staff annoyingly insisted on calling it. The amount of food that came out was as small as the abbreviated name. The staff then proceeded to clean up around us as we were still eating, the place wasn't even busy so I don't know why they wanted us out so quickly. \n\nA place for people with more money than sense!"
0,"You, sir, are not a Ritz-Carlton. When I first walked in, it impressed. It had tasteful, old school decor and helpful people at every turn. The problems started when one of the people in our party had his card declined at check-in (not for the room cost because those were already covered, but for the incidentals). I am told that this decline was not his fault and I would certainly believe him as this is not the type of man who runs up his credit cards. Either way, the hotel staff should have asked another one of us for our cards, but for some reason they just stubbornly kept trying to run the same card for 5 minutes. This was while the rest of us waited, twiddling our thumbs. Oh, yes and we were already running late so this was very annoying. Finally, a manager came over and said that they would figure it out later. Well, within 10 minutes when we were finally in our room, here comes a call on the room phone telling us to come down as soon as possible and put a card on file. Ummm, okay. And why couldn't they just ask when we were just down there???? The room did not impress and was in fact so terribly run down that even the marble in the bathroom had rusted in spots and the pipes under the sink were corroded and leaking. Really, supposed \""Ritz-Carlton\""? But here it is, people. Probably the most rude thing that I have ever experienced from a hotel W down to La Quinta: I went to the front desk to ask for a razor and shaving cream. The woman at the desk very helpfully and condescendingly directed me to the tiny gift shop closet where she said they sell it. So, here I was expecting to pay $12 for some crappy bic and a tiny bottle of foam. But no, I guess they were out of them because none was to be found. When I came out of the shop-closet she asked if I found it. I said no, there wasn't any in there. She replied oh, well I will see if room service can bring one to your room. Now, that's odd. When I went to my room, housekeeping was just outside the door. I asked if they might have a shaving kit and the maid rolled her eyes, dug around in her cart and handed me a \""ritz carlton\"" official box with a razor and tube of cream inside. For...real... What terrible, money-grubbing, uncouth service! So, yeah. Perhaps consider staying here if you like to be treated like trailer trash who is not nearly good enough for their moldy, falling apart hotel. But, then again I think there is a W nearby. Paris prices for Arkansas accommodations."
1,"I have to say that this place was absolutely phenomenal! I would go back there in a heartbeat. I'm posting this a little late; my husband and I went there for dinner about 1 month ago at the end of July. This was our honeymoon and I am so happy that we got to experience this restaurant.\n\nFirstly, the hostess was very very sweet and asked us if we were celebrating anything special. I said that it was our honeymoon and they treated us like gold. They seem to be very nice accommodating and customer friendly anyway so I have no doubt that they would have true that's just the same had it not been a special occasion.  The restaurant was very clean and decorated in a very modern and contemporary atmosphere. Our waiter was fabulous, explaining everything on the menu, going over all of the specials in cocktails explaining everything in detail. He was wonderful! \n\nEverything we ordered was awesome. To start, we got complimentary duck pate, which I've never had before but it was really good! After this course, they provided complimentary cheese popovers, which were again amazing. They also provided small recipe cards so you can make the pop overs at home if you wish. I thought this was a very nice touch and very classy. My husband and I shared the Porterhouse  for two, got a few sides, and also three dipping sauces to try. Again everything was delicious!  We picked everything clean!  Additionally, the cocktails were very good. My only criticism is that each cocktail was $14 each which, I know is Vegas, but still, a little expensive.  Naturally, we had to splurge on dessert and we weren't disappointed. So rich and delicious, each I believe were only $10, which seemed like a steal compared to everything else, haha. \n\nHoweve, my favorite part throughout the whole experience was watching the staff members throughout the evening. There seem to be multiple managers walking around, checking on customers, in addition to the incredibly efficient wait staff. I was very impressed that multiple folks came by to ask us how our meal was, how experience was, and knew that it was our honeymoon and congratulated us.  It made us feel really special and made the experience very personalized.  They also gave us a complimentary dessert which were too small chocolate bites because they knew it was our honeymoon and my husband's birthday was the day before. It was cute, small, and had a lit candle in it which was very nice.\n\nWe absolutely loved it and I wish that there was one near off in Boston! It would probably make us go broke!"
0,"Read all the reviews before going so I was a little skeptical but thought I would try anyway. Cute little place, seated right away which was good for a Saturday at 1230. Ordered eggs Benedict but they had sold out! A breakfast place that runs out of breakfast food, hum. Got the breakfast sandwich which came out cut in half, on a large white plate with no garnish. Had to ask for silverware and napkins. Service was ok, sandwich average."
1,"Tucked away in the middle of the McDowell Mountain Ranch neighborhood, this Pizza joint is a hidden gem.  We've driven by it dozens of times and finally decided to stop by and give it a try.  It was a Sunday night and there were only a few tables occupied in the restaurant.  After browsing the menu, I spotted a unique item...it's called the Vesuvio.  It's a  1/2 Calzone,  1/2 Pizza concoction....I had to try it.  Additionally, it was happy hour, so Pizza was 1/2 price!  So we ordered:\n\nPepperoni Pizza, $14 (regular price, happy hour is 1/2 off)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=BLFokFO1e7C4iph6BcJU7Q#BLFokFO1e7C4iph6BcJU7Q\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=3hFzBESdIbdRZ8zZDx63tg#3hFzBESdIbdRZ8zZDx63tg\n\nThe Vesuvio (1/2 Calzone, 1/2 Pizza), $16\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=cxvJ6_KDrbbIG4YlrnFdBg#cxvJ6_KDrbbIG4YlrnFdBg\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=00i0JtsGG9qUkCIeJTkx-A#00i0JtsGG9qUkCIeJTkx-A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ciao-grazie-scottsdale?select=itgoHpgq-OCxgkoetT6GYA#itgoHpgq-OCxgkoetT6GYA\n\nAfter a short wait, we  got our food and I was looking forward to diving into the Vesuvio, so that's what I tried first....I cut a piece of the Calzone and Pizza.  I tried the Calzone portion first....and it was bland....the Dough, Ricotta Cheese, and Ham were good and fresh, but it didn't have a much flavor....I think if there was some Sauce for dipping or if they had Sauce in the Calzone, it would be better.  The Pizza portion of the Vesuvio was awesome...it was a Mushroom/Cheese Pizza.  It had good flavor and was cooked perfectly.  After the 1st bite of the Calzone, I started to combine a piece of the Pizza and a piece of the Calzone together to make it taste good.  Perhaps that's how I should've been eating it from the start...? \n\nThe Pepperoni Pizza was awesome....full of flavor and the thin crust was cooked perfectly.  \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our dinner here.  I'm glad we stopped by.  We'll definitely be back for Happy Hour.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
1,"The new crispy chicken sandwiches are the \"" bomb \"" and only a buck"
0,"Everything in here is extravagantly overpriced. Everything Bed Bath & Beyond brand is total junk and extravagantly overpriced. \n\nUnfortunately, even though the people here are quite pleasant and helpful, the store itself is just such a money black-hole with incredibly low value."
1,"We stopped here for lunch to get Subway. We were tired and hungry and sort of in shitty moods. I love donuts...and seeing Winchell's inside of a Subway caught me off guard, for one never seen a donut shop inside of a Subway...and second never heard of Winchell's period. The donuts were fresh, plump and full of sugary, doughy goodness. They were great, and it was nice to have something different for a change instead of the double D's."
0,Too crowded and music was questionable...
0,"So I saved a couple of bucks, or did I by going to Sam's Optical.  The optometrist is only there on Saturdays, so they can't confirm your prescription unless he is there?  When I asked for my written prescription, they wouldn't give it to me and I was standing right in front of them because the Optometrist wasn't there.  Also I ordered some contacts, and when I went to pick them up, they couldn't find them.  I insisted they keep looking and half an hour later, they finally located them.  By the way, they had called me to tell me they were in.  Now I realize their prices aren't that good anyway.  Don't waste your time, saving what isn't that much money."
1,"**Edited:  My review is actually for a different location; I didn't realize there were too so close by**\n\nI remember when this was Tony Romas....after it reopened as \""the new Italian Place\"" I tried it and though, \""eh, it's okay.\""\n\nI went back today to meet a friend and.... mmmmmm mmmmm mmmmm.  If you've read my other reviews, please know that I do eat food other than chicken Parmesan.  I've just been eating a lot of it lately.\n\nSo...I had the chicken parm and it was delicious!  The breading was amazing.  I feel, because of my frequent C.P. encounters, and because I have an Italian husband who likes to cook for me, I am pretty knowledgeable when it comes to good C.P....and this was terrific.\n\nThe decor is nice.  Charming and relaxing.  The booths are huge.  The service was great.  The water tasted horrible.\n\nAnd that is my review."
0,"The food here is great, but hype doesn't mean you can slack on service. We went for lunch for the first time and arrived at 1:20. They sold us on a buffet they closed 20 minutes prior but did not mention it. We paid for a half full buffet they had no intention of re-stocking and didn't care when we asked about why they didn't tell us. \n\nWe paid $30.00 to not eat here.\n\nSo disappointing!"
1,"I've probably eaten at Apsara 10 times since they opened and have not had a bad dish. My favorites include the Haw Mook, the Coconut Lemongrass Soup with Tofu and the Saramann. They don't seem to have the dinner menu on the website but they are open for dinner, might want to call first at night because I've gone down a couple of times to find them closed. (Still sorting out hours of operation?)"
0,"The staff was RUDE!  I understand that Saturday nights are busy, but that was no excuse for how they treated my family. I was in with my mother and her friend in order to help my mother's goddaughter celebrate her birthday. Someone knocked my mother's friend's drink all over her, and, being classy, she didn't cause a scene. The staff member came over, yelled at my MOM for causing a mess, and proceeded to push her around by driving the mop right up to her feet. This was after several rude interactions we had, and it was the final straw for me. I will never go back. There are too many other options in Vegas, and quite frankly, the club right across the hallway in the Mirage was more fun and had staff who were less impressed with themselves."
1,"Hands down, the best barbecue I've ever had. As their motto speaks \""we rub our meat\"" and you can tell by the amount of flavor it in. The meat was moist and yet had a nice crust. I loved the vinegar based sauce that went well with the wonderfully cooked meats. \n\nMy husband had. The three rib combo, and the meat was tender. Not exactly falling off the bone, but came off the bone cleanly, which I prefer. \n\nThe portions were ample and I would definitely return."
1,"Experience:  I have heard about this place many times, and always wanted to check it out. I met some friends for lunch and someone that was late mentioned he was  shopping there.  I decided since it was so close, I would go check it out. \n\nService: wow!  What else can I say?  The people in this grocery store are so nice and helpful.  I had at least 3 people ask me if I needed help while I was in there.  No wonder why everyone loves their customer service. \n\nFood: They have many organic and health food products as one would expect, but my favorite part was the pre-made single servings of salads and meals. I bought several of them, and enjoyed every one I bought.  \n\nFacility:  although a small grocery store with maybe 5 or 6 isles, it had a decent selection. It was very clean and made you want to shop there. \n\nOverall review: definitely a 5 star experience!  I will be back; even though, they are not really convenient to me. I will make a special trip just to shop here again."
1,"This place is a gem. The Butter Bars are the best ever, not too rich so it makes your stomach ill, but perfect taste and 10 miles after i left wished i would have gotten more. Chocolate filled was best ever too."
1,"Had a great time here over the weekend.  Definitely recommend making a reservation with the manager, Jennifer, as she made sure we had a good view for the Bellagio fountains.  She came by to introduce herself and make sure everything was going well while also providing some complimentary appetizers.  Very nice gesture.  We were celebrating an anniversary so we also received a complimentary dessert that said happy anniversary on the plate.  Highly recommended restaurant with a great view and great food!"
1,"This is one of the few buffets that my classmates and I have not tried so we came and visited it one day after class.  It was around 12pm and we were starving! The line to pay wasn't long, but we waited about 5-10 minutes to get seated.  I was pretty impressed with the selection at this place.  I hated the lunch buffet at Green Valley, Mandalay Bay, and Planet Hollywood, so I expected this buffet to be completely disappointing.  I'm glad they proved me wrong!!\n\nTheir sushi spread wasn't that great.  They had two platters full of tiny little sushi rolls.  But they had a bunch of stations that I seriously couldn't even get to because I was so full!! They served crab legs and oysters in one end, and BBQ tri tip and filet slices on the other.  Their pasta station wasn't that great though, all they had that day was spaghetti with meatballs. Their dessert station was okay.  Their sugar free stuff did not taste very good but their gelatos, chocolate pastries, and cookies were yummy!  \n\nIt was still a good experience. Another buffet to check off my list.  I only have two more months left here in Vegas, and I have 2-3 more casino buffets to hit up before leaving!"
1,"I absolutely love this place. The service is professional, attentive, and friendly. The food is always prepared exceptionally. The drinks are strong but not overpowering the taste of the flavors. If you go, PLEASE GET THE MUSSELS-- I'm from Seattle and these are some of the best I have had (as well as the oysters). Can be a little spendy-- but hey you have to pay some money sometimes for good food. \n\nSimply I do not know why this place is getting some bad reviews. You HAVE to go ."
0,"Be sure you read these carefully, because it will help you decide which way to go.  There is some good information, but it totally depends on your viewpoint.\n\nIf you're a fan of musicals in general, and Phantom in particular, then chances are that you'll like the theater (it's very nice), and you'll find the explosions spectacular, but that's about it.  The running time is short, so you'll be able to get back to your slot machine or buffet - but you're going to be disappointed by the show itself.\n\nIf you're a fan of movies, and don't particularly care for theater, then chances are you'll like the show.  It's short enough to keep your attention, and not long on most things that people who don't like theater find boring.\n\nMy opinion is that the show was pretty bad.  I much prefer every version I've ever seen - even the movie (which wasn't that great).  Traveling versions, which are typically not good, have been better.  One that I saw in LA some twenty years ago with Robert Guillame, was excellent, and a semi-permanent version in Toronto a decade or so ago, was probably the best I've ever seen.  This was blech.  Not spectacular by any means.\n\nThey'll tell you it's chilly, but it's not.  The explosions help with that, as does the crowd.  You can definitely get better deals than the box office."
0,"I have been here once early this year, went there around 9pm and everything was ok...I am not a Pho expert but I liked it at the time. This time I figure I invite out of town guests at around 0230 in the morning Monday December 22nd 2014.....The initial waitress did not say a single word to us in the 4 times she went to our table and took a little over 10 minutes to make first contact. The Male waiter was short and unfriendly too, got our order and disappeared , forgot the spoons. \n\nThe food was ok but ruined by RUDE service and the following: My guest (which happens to run a million dollar restaurant)  requested carbonated water from the soda tap (gas bubbles and water).... when we got the bill they charged it as a full flavored soda \n\n3 dollars for carbonated water! \nwe questioned it since nowhere else in AMERICA they charge for Co2 and water, they went to get the manager (which claimed to be the owner). That younger male with an attitude of a major jerk, leaned on the table with both \""fists\"" on the table, leaned over into our personal space and asked: whats your problem! \n\nThe question of why in the name of everything that is 100% free anywhere in America he was charging 3 dollars for carbonated water and with a major attitude and tone of voice he said: \n\n\""I don't care if I lose a customer that doesn't want to pay for carbonated water, Its 2.99 and I will not remove it from the bill\"" .\n\nNeedless to say the rude waiters did not get tip and I will never go back and I will never suggest this hole again.  I am sure that punk is the SON of the hard working parents who most likely slave all morning and afternoon to get this restaurant running..... If you look at the reviews, most of the lesser stars are because the graveyard staff attitude."

0,"I had the worst experience ever. I have been client of this bank since 8 years ago., But I hadn't been in this branch before. \nI went there in March 2013 with 7000 dollars to deposit in my account. This  money was my moms which is visiting here from South America. I offered her to keep her money in my account while she is here in Arizona.\nI filled in my deposit slip. Teller asks me to \""wait\"" while she goes to the back and counts the money. Well, she comes back to the front to tell me that there is only 6000 dollars in there. I told her I was absolutely sure i had 7000$.... And told me to go ahead and count.  Of course, the 1000 missing were not going to be there anymore. \n\nOk. I filed the complaint to the manager in charge of the branch. She said she was going to start an investigation and they would come back to me in a few days. She did follow up with me for about a week, with no answers from the security company that was supposed to be going to review the cameras and the videos.... Well, this was almost 4 months ago. Never got any answer, and of course,i as the customer, ended up with the short end of the stick. I lost 1000 dollars, that the teller was supposed to count IN FRONT OF ME,but she did not, and also, being completelly ignored by the staff of the bank who never gave me any answer. I will cancel my account with htis bank, and will make sure people knows about the poor service that i received after losing my money. I still cant believe this situation happened in this bank."
0,"Both times I have been there the food is average at best, definitely not great.  Basically overpriced bar food.  Waitress screwed up our orders this last time.  Won't be going back, there are much better places."
1,"If you can get in, this is the most consistently delightful dining experience in Pittsburgh. The specialty cocktails at the bar are extremely interesting and varied. If you're into more traditional cocktails, the best old fashioned I've ever had is from here. \n\nEssentially every piece of food I've had from my few trips here has been delightful. The bone marrow is fun and well made, the goat-butter and jam appetizer is a wonderful combination of flavor, the mac-and-cheese is extremely good, and the spicy stuffed dates were so good I've tried replicating them at home. For entrees, I've had/tried burgers, chicken pot pie, mussels, and a few other dishes I'm forgetting. Not a single one has let me down. \n\nBottom line is: If you want a meal to remember, get a reservation and try as much on their menu as you can. You will not regret it."
1,Best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas we've been too so far.
1,"I have been eating lunch at Dish for years and I have always enjoyed what I have ordered! From the Chicken n Dumplings, the grilled tilapia lunch special, half of a grilled pimiento cheese sandwich with a cup of tomato soup to the spinach n mushroom quesadilla. Fun, casual atmosphere and a variety of clientele. I am never disappointed! My friends and co-workers love it, too."
1,"This review goes out to Marc M. and is the only reason why I'm writing a review for a pretzel stand.  :P\n\nWho doesn't love a sinfully warm soft-baked pretzel?  Throw in some processed cheese sauce and it's a party!  I tend to find myself gravitating towards their Wetzel Bites with easy salt when I'm strolling through Chandler Fashion.  It's small enough where you can hurriedly pop them into your mouth when you suddenly find yourself in need of grabbing items and it's in a convenient bag so you can shove them into your purse when you've decided you've had enough.  When I do find myself wanting a regular pretzel though, I like to get the pepperoni with the cheese sauce.  It's a pizza pretzel!  No matter how you get it, which flavor you purchase, or which sauce you'd like the buy, it'll always be a tasty and unhealthy bite.  Feel that grease coat your mouth and don't think about how many carbs and calories you're consuming.  Just enjoy that pillowy buttery goodness. The outside crust is always crisp, the inside is melty like ice cream on a hot summer day, and the cheese sauce is always given to you warm and gooey.  Mmm!  They also do a two for $5 pretzel deal so bring a friend! \n\nEver since Cinnabon closed down, Wetzel's Pretzels are my go-to snack when I'm shopping at Chandler Fashion Center.  I'm not knocking Auntie Anne's since I do buy pretzels from them as well but Wetzel's has the better location!"
1,"We happened to be there for happy hour, so we surely had tons of saki.  But we ordered from the menu for our dinner.  \n\nThe waitresses were surely smokin' when we were there, my male cousin appreciated it very much.  Overall very good, nice vibe, great hang out with friends.\n\nOdd suggestion, but a stop to the bathroom is a must."
0,"I have gone here a few times in the last few years. I remember one time, ordering the sliders... DISGUSTING!!! It tasted like rotten meat... or as if the meat had fallen on the ground and put back on the buns. GROSS. It was game day, so it took forever getting the food, so we never complained or asked for another order since we had been starving. I ate the fries ONLY. Then, another time I visited, we asked for Pizza Rolls (thinking maybe they're as good as Casey Jones'). Nope... they were friggin Totino's pizza rolls, probably like $4 for a box of them at the grocery store, but $6.95 here. The next time I went, I didn't order food, I knew better! Don't have much to say about drinks, since I had nothing but water. Even that doesn't taste great though, like tap water. Great atmosphere for games, but just atrocious food."
1,Love the beer. Love the food. Love the atmosphere. Service can use some work.  It's not a hurry up n grab a bite n drink type of place. Highly recommended tho.
1,"This has become one of our new favorite breakfast places in Phoenix, The Vovomeena! They have unique food combinations that are delicious, a very comfortable dinning experience and their name is fun to say ~ Vovomeena.  Say it with me; \""Vovomeena\"" :-)\n\nzee food ~ My fave is the Mexican Benedict or the BMOC.  They both are excellent choices!  The Mexican Benedict has great favor and textures with poached eggs a top of the english muffins with some chorizo and a great hollandaise.  The BMOC is pockchop/waffle/eggies and a portuguese donut (not made by a portugese person nor flown in from Portugal because I asked..) is a flavor-fest!   My son loves the Pain Perdu which is banana bread pudding french toast with the most amazing whiskey caramel sauce and a side of bacon or sausage.  I like it as well! The coffee is great and they provide you with a to-go cup when you're ready.  \n\nzee place to eat ~ it's nicely decorated with plenty of seating despite this place is so small.  They have a few larger tables, which provide you an opportunity to dine with others you may or may not know :-)  The staff is very friendly and they are always ready to help you find their morning moonshine.  \n\nIt's a great little place for breakfast.  I hope to see you there some day soon!  I'll save you a spot at the end of the big table :-)"
1,"I've known of Duo for ages but this is the first time I've made a purchase. If you have supermodel legs and hate baggy boots flapping around your calves and need boots to fit, come to Duo. If you have larger calves and normally struggle with zipping up, then come here too. \n\nOver Christmas there were gorgeous jewel coloured shoes and boots in the window. They caught my eye and ever since, I diverted my shopping track to go via Castle Street.\n\nThe sale is on at the moment and it was in search of the perfect flats that lured me in. Duo don't have a huge range and the shop seems huge for what stock there is. The plus point of this means lots of room to try stuff on. \n\nShoes also come in non standard sizes - at least skinny, regular and wide fittings. I managed to get a pair of skinny flats in the sale - nothing fancy but smart enough to wear for hours at a time in work. I'm also hoping to avoid blisters due to the leather insides and smooth seems :-)\n\nService was good with helpful sales assistants bringing out different sizes and fits. The shop will be relocating soon, but I'm sure I'll be visiting again."
1,"I am a big fan of Outback steakhouses.  This one is extra special because it is open for lunch!  My standard lunch order is the blossom burger with a French onion soup.  The burger is a monster burger with a single portion of the blooming onion sitting on top of it.  As for my dinner order I get the blooming onion app, the chopped salad is one of the best things on the menu and one of the best salads I have ever eaten and for my entree I go with the filet with a blue cheese crumb crust.  Side for me is either the mashed potatoes or the sweet potato with honey butter and cinnamon."
0,Maybe I am missing something but I just didn't find anything special about my sandwich.  Maybe I was expecting more because of all the positive reviews at other locations.  Store was clean and staff was friendly but the sandwich itself was just a notch above a Quizno's or Subway.  I probably won't go back.
0,"This was good when it first opened but is now indistinguishable from the Americanized greasy spoon Mexican fare that you get everywhere else in Phoenix. \n\nPrices are okay, chips and salsa are included (and the chips are served warm) and the portions are enormous. But the food isn't particularly interesting, relying too heavily on fat and carbs and not enough on interesting flavors.\n\nEvery time I go, want Abuelo's to be a classy Mexican restaurant that distinguishes itself through a refined Mexican palate not a substitute for Macayo's."
1,We frequent this establishment and have never been disappointed
0,They just can't follow direction in getting an order right. If these kids are our future...we're in trouble.
1,"Say what you will about this place, but overall, I dig it. I didn't appreciate it when I lived in Scottsdale, but as I have moved farther and farther away, I find myself wanting to go here more and more. There are many good restaurants, nightclubs, bars, hotels, stores, activities, and people watching. I guess it isn't for everyone since a lot of people talk shit and hate this place. I get it rest-of-Phoenix-metro-area, you don't like the people. WHAAAAAH! Shut up.  It's better in Scottsdale than most of the valley. Here are my top choices in Old Town in no particular order:\n\n-Mastro's City Hall\n-The Lodge\n-Daily Dose\n-Civic Center\n-Scottsdale Stadium\n-Joe's NY Pizza\n-The Casablanca Lounge\n-Grimaldi's Pizza\n-Rusty Spur\n-AZ 88\n-W\n-Fashion Square Mall\n-Culinary Dropout\n\nI could list more, but you have Yelp at your disposal.  Use it! :-)"
1,"Berties!  Like your favourite big cosy jumper that's covered in bobbles but your too attached to to throw it away.  That's the feeling I get when I enter Berties.  It's a familiar friend. Has a homely feel, like you are walking into someones living room, mainly because the pub consists of two smallish rooms. One lined with banquet seating and the other with the bar and some seating.  It's got a old-man pub style but the clientele are generally young and musios due to probably having the best juke box in town!  Location is pretty central and close to the Kings theatre.  There is a good range of ales and the staff are friendly and there always a good crowd of people here."
1,"I'm not your typical Vegas-goer as I don't do the club scene and am usually here for conferences.  HRH has a reputation for being pretty crazy with their Rehab party - from the looks of it, I think it certainly lived up to that reputation.  \n\nHere's a review from someone who was sober the entire time:\n\nPools:  I think that they have the best pools in Vegas.  If you're like me, then Sunday morning is probably not the best time to go...but anytime during the week, when it's fairly empty, the pools are like a glimmering oasis of blue.  I think there's 10 or more.  I know that they close early, but I was able to walk in and dip my toes in ... I saw some people swimming so as long as you're discreet, maybe it's possible to do some pm swimming :)\n\nFood:  I only ate at Pink Taco.  Their happy hour was ridiculously cheap.  We sat at the bar and ordered one of everything (giant fatties).  They seem to do chicken the best (skewers).  I also recommend the tamales.\n\nRoom:  We stayed in the Paradise Tower.  It's set further back from the hotel.  The room is very rock 'n roll - dark wall paper (very gothic) and I think the most comfortable bed...ever?  I've slept in some nice beds, but wow...after a long (make that 5 LONG days at a conference) this was a total treat.  \n\nBathroom:  The shower was pretty big and I like that it was separate from the sinks.  Products were great - some brand, Prickly Pear (?).  \n\nGym:  I really wanted to go...it looked very clean, small, but had a lot of equipment.  \n\nI took a star off because the resort fee does suck - especially since I didn't get to use any of the amenities."
1,"fantastic thai food at a reasonable price. worth a visit! if you like sweet tea, try the Thai ice tea."
0,"RUDE - we chose this place from an article a friend read. Our waiter had an attitude, I never knew a vegetable could have NO taste and don't even think about getting two separate checks if they already put it in the computer. Found much better food and service at Olive - I suggest that instead!"
0,I went to check it out after my workout at LVAC store was extremely hot and uncomfortable inside. Poor customer service did not  seem interested in helping me. Selection poor and price high . Definitely not worth checking out !!!
0,Id been here a few times and the service was always unprofessional (texting and talking on the phone mostly). The performance of the technician is shotty but today takes the cake. The technician pull a huge chunk out of my eyebrow and then refused 2 admit it was her fault. She asked if I had a scar there and if i was sure. SUPER horrible! Will never go back!!!
0,"Here is the quick and dirty. This place is fine, not great. \n\nThe room and bathroom were very nice. We stayed on the 22nd floor. The prices are also pretty good, we stayed over New Years and they had some of the best prices for their location.  The location was really good too...it is in the center of everything. \n\nDownsides, we self-parked and to get to registration and the elevators you have to lug your bags EVERYWHERE! Everything is VERY spread out! Pack light if you can. They didn't give us room keys that were programed correctly too! Which ment that it was a 15 min hike back to the lobby to fix the keys...thank goodness there was this nice man on our floor that worked their and called security to have them let us in.  Security was super professional, friendly and nice to us. We actually didn't spend any time in the hotel at all, I wasn't a fan of the casino. With everything being so spread out you didn't get the feel of being welcome and held in. We ended up going over to the Bellagio and Planet Hollywood for food and fun. They also charge you for internet, but that isn't that uncommon and it was pretty reasonably priced. We did get charged for signing up two different laptops in the same 24 hr period, but it was only $15 each. \n\nOverall, the price is right and the location is key so I'd stay again."
0,"I'm 100% Italian-American. I grew up on Italian, home-cooked food, I've spent a month in Italy and literally ate my way through the country, and have an eleven-letter Italian last name that people constantly butcher when they try to pronounce it.  It is that experience that prompted me to sign up for Yelp and give Battista's its deserved one star. It was dismal. \n\nThe main reason I am writing this is to dispel myths circling around (from LOCALS no less) that this place is fun and has good Italian food. Neither is true. Though our wait staff was attentive and prompt, the good service we got just didn't outweigh the bad food. \n\nThe decor is kitschy - crap all over the place. The food pricing is way too expensive for iceberg salad, adequate garlic bread and mediocre wine. I ordered a chicken dish and had minestrone. They were both way too salty (a trick used by restaurants to hide poor quality or good-tasting food). And yes, the accordion player was awkward to say the least. \n\nOver-priced, overrated and a tourist trap with a miraculously good reputation. My advice? Go to Maggiano's for GREAT Italian food. Or Olive Garden. Or Buca di Beppo's even.  Just please, don't go here. Don't perpetuate the Battista's myth."
0,"I have been to Pin Kaow many times and the food is very good. However, I went there last night at 9:25pm and immediately upon walking in the manager told me the restaurant will be closing in 15 minutes.  Clearly on the front door it says they close at 10pm. However, the real issue is they should have been much more accommodating to any customer, especially a regular customer. Instead they unnecessarily turned down business. I went to Gaati Thai restaurant right after and they were much more accommodating and have much better food. They also close at 10pm and even though I got there at 9:45, they still set up a table and did not rush the meal at all. \n\nI will never go back to Pin Kaow and will no longer recommend it to friends and family. That is thousands of dollars lost for their lack of customer service and decency."
0,"I was starving and didn't know better, like check yelp reviews first.  And so I blindly dove head first into this place.   It was freezing outside, so I ordered the chicken porridge with fried chinese donuts and a soy milk.  It tasted fine while I ate it and I was feeling fine after I finished.   About an hour later after I got back to my hotel room, all hell broke loose in my bowel system and I was in the shitter for quite some time.  It reminded me of the scene from the movie \""Van Wilder\"" where the dude had to just take a dump right there and then.  We're talking montezuma revenge of some sort and possibly a colon cleansing experience.  My eyes rolled back and I just dropped huge bombs into that poor porcelain stall. Needless to say, it must've been the food that I ate from here!  I would not eat here right before you go skydiving if you get my drift?!"
0,"I was not even going to give this place a star.  The service was horrible, it took over 10 minutes for someone to approach us to take our beverage order, then it took another 10 minutes to get the drinks, which should have been our cue to leave.\n\nWe then ordered chips and salsa to start, which again took forever to get to us, then why we continued to order more was beyond me, but we did, which included the queso poblano dip, nothing exciting to write about, in addition to two very small tacos, which were ok, and then some potstickers, which my son said were horrible, and I took a bit and he was right.  Anyway, I will spare you the rest, just don't recommend going here, and we live in Vegas, and could recommend several other places that do a better job.   Very disappointed!"
0,"This store is nothing but a business that is only interested in taking care of  themselves and their cash register.  You walk into this place and there are store associates everywhere, but do you think they would acknowledge you and help you...heck NO!!  I looked at the poor animals in the dirty disgusting display boxes with very little room to move around in and be comfortable.  This store is VERY OVERPRICED ON EVERYTHING!  From a previous store purchase they gave me this scratch off to use on a future purchase.  Well i went into the store after that visit and took a bag of dog food, but to learn that this so called redemption card does not qualify towards buying pet food out of it.  The card was valued at $25.  The snobby rude clerk told me to buy some toys for my dog...Honestly do you think i'm going to buy over $25 in toys for my dog, when he has a toy box full of them?  How ridiculous!  On the way out of the store, I noticed a big box filled with stuffed pillows, and was going to buy one of them.  But when I asked a store associate how much it was, she said it was over $60.00.  Oh, no thank you, I will pass.  This store is insane with their merchandise and how damn expensive they are in \""EVERYTHING\"" they sell!  If I could rate a 1/2 star i would, because of the poor operation of this business!  I will NEVER shop this store again."
1,"I loved this place. It's an indoor track with carts that they said can get up to 45mph. Some of the corners are tight and it was tough not to brush up against them. The race prior to ours saw several accidents and pile ups. The worst one was when one racer ended up under the wall and 3 others crashed into him/her. Other reviews said that if you hit the wall or other cars you would be thrown out. That wasn't the case the night we were there. They had to stop the race before ours at least 3 times because carts were hitting each other and slamming into the walls, but no one was thrown out. Our race wasn't stopped at all, but several people did make contact with other carts. \n\nEach race is made up of 12 drivers max. So, you'll be racing against strangers unless you bring a large group with you. One race (12 laps around the track) is $30. If you think you'll visit this place often, you might as well get their annual membership for $55. Your first race after purchasing the membership if free and every race after that is $20. Kids are welcome but you have to be at least 15 to drive the carts. \n\nI'm not sure how busy this place gets on other nights, but on the Sunday that we went there weren't many people. Our wait time was about 15 minutes. This place is located right next to the Palms and Palms Place.\n\nTIP: after your race take time to chill and relax. You don't want to hit the roads with the same aggression you had driving the carts around."
1,"Only stopped in for one drink, but like it enough to return to try the rest out!\n\nThe atmosphere was great, you might have to yell a little bit to be heard, but that's part of the thrill of coming here. \n\nI ended up with a seasonal brew called Odelay! which is a delicious mexican chocolate ale. If you're worried about too much sweetness, then there are no worries with this brew. Get it if you are looking for a solid dark ale. \n\nSidenote - Had I seen it, I would have gone for the beer sampler that they had. There were a ton of beers on the wood board and it looked delicious!\n\nMy partner had the Raj IPA. For those who don't drink IPA often this was a smooth one. Had a little kick, per usual of the brew, but a nice introduction to what standard IPA's taste like. In addition, the appetizers were good, but I personally found them a little flavorless. Don't get me wrong though, they were FILLING. The calamari and the spinach dip were rich, and we felt pretty full after trying both of them. A little more salt wouldn't hurt though. \n\nThis place loses a star for the service. Everyone was friendly, but our server was fairly unattached to our experience and stopped by three times total. \n\nStay tuned. I'm definitely heading back."
0,"Absolutely Awful EXPERIENCE!!!!\n\nIf you are a bride please don't waste your time here.  There is absolutely no customer service.  My bridesmaid dresses were not delivered as promised we had to come back 3 times to pick them up and each time we went they were not there.  The ladies that were there had no tact.  They don't return calls, or answer the phones, the store is nasty, disgusting and filthy.  Needless to say we ended up getting all 5 of our dresses for free, it was a huge hassle but it happened.\n\nDON'T PURCHASE ANYTHING FOR YOUR WEDDING HERE IF YOU ARE ON A TIME SCHEDULE!!"
0,"I absolutely detest this Costco. Like many of the reviews state, this Costco has a reputation for rude and lazy employees. Of course there are a few helpful employees but the card check clerks are rude.  I am surprised because I have never experienced such poor service at a Costco before. It may be my imagination but this location seems smaller and exceedingly more crowded than most locations. I miss Chandler Costco where they have the U Scan checkout. I usually drive out of my way to Chandler or Gilbert Costco. Beware of the lunch rush aka free samples in the afternoon."
1,"I use to work here....\nMy favorite dishes on the menu are: hot and sour soup, yakisoba noddles, orange chicken, red curry and Mongolian style beef.  \n\nHappy hours are good for appetizers I recommended the wings and calamari ask for a side of salad dressing to dip with-----amazing!\n\nSaturday lunches are 5 dollars for any dish includes a salad. Be aware service and time can take a little longer since the kitchen is backed up with in house and to go orders. \n\nThis place has good food and fast service."
1,"What a great spot for a quick, filling and inexpensive lunch! Been here several times for lunch breaks with the Mrs. and we've always been able to get in and out of here in a timely manner and happily full.  \n\nThey have a variety of options including salads, gyro platters, or a simple gyro with fries. The food is made fresh to order and you can even sit and watch it being made through a glass divider. I like being able to see exactly how my food is handled and they whip through orders with a sense of urgency and understanding that people may want to get back to work.  \n\nThere are usually a fair number of people grabbing to-go, so this seems like a good option for those who don't have time to sit and eat, but want a good hot, meal at their desk instead of the standard bagged sandwich. \n\nI've no doubt we'll be back."
0,"I got a groupon for this place and I really should think about groupons more in depth before I purchase.\n\nI went over this past Saturday to get an oil change. It looked like no one was working. I went inside to see a mechanic laying on the couch and another behind the computer. I asked him if there was a long wait for an oil change and the guy behind the counter said \""yes\"" like he was very irritated. \n\nSo I said okay, and got the F out of dodge. That place creeped me out and I really did not want to go back. Luckily, groupon gave me a credit for this purchase. I'm going back to Jiffy Lube!!!!"
1,I love this place!  The women do a great job threading and are fast and friendly while they do it.  I get a full face thread and they are very good and reasonable.  I like that there is a store rather than a mall kiosk where you feel like exposed.  Nice quiet store with beautiful Indian music and nice staff.
1,Great find for poke.  Its more of a deli than a restaurant. Great for picking up food on way back to hotel.
1,"One of my favorite restaurants. Really reasonable prices, fast service, fantastic specialty drinks. Great bloody Mary!\n\nHaven't had anything bad here! I love the mushu chicken and orange chicken. It's typical high end chinese food, but pretty authentic, and not greasy.\n\nEvery time I bring people here they thank me."
1,"Chicken burritttoooooo! Since this one is in the Marketplace, it's pretty much always busy. They are still good at getting you in and out though."
1,"This is a really great taco stand style place.  While the fact that you order at the counter, and the look of the menu they have displayed may remind you of Filibertos' or any other [fill in the blank]bertos' restaurant, the comparison ends there.  \n\nThe place itself is decorated very nicely, with a modern touch, as well as a Mexican influence.  There's a salsa bar with a variety of salsas and spicy vegetables that is properly maintained so it doesn't look like everything has been sitting out for a week like you see in some other places.\n\nI've been there twice so far, and have only tried two things.  Carne asado tacos and a carne asada burrito.  I think you can judge if a Mexican food restaurant is good by the quality of their carne asada.  In this case their carne asada is really top notch.  They use quality steak, and it seems like they grill it on an open flame instead of just a flat grill (Just based on taste, didn't actually see them do it).\n\nI highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great giant burrito for only around $4.50."
0,"I knew something was wrong when I entered Leone. It didn't even smell like coffee. The atmosphere was not what I expected either; it didn't have the energy of a coffee shop--it felt like a cafe in a casino.\n\n I ordered an iced latte, but what they handed me had no coffee flavor at all. I took it back to the counter, where another customer was saying that her chai latte didn't taste right. The employees decided they must have switched them. I don't think so--there were certainly no chai spices in my drink. \n\nThey attempted my drink again, and handed me an iced coffee. I gave up seeking accuracy and accepted it. I have never tasted such terrible coffee. It was inferior to instant coffee (and I'm not a fan of that either!) It had all the bitterness of a very dark roast coffee, without any coffee taste. \n\nMy husband had an iced mocha, which had an okay chocolate flavor, but again...the coffee seemed to be missing. He also had a pastry, which was definitely past its sell-by date."
0,"From the outside, Phu Thanh looks different from any other Vietnamese restaurant in town. It's larger, has a huge presence outside of the typical hidden strip mall, and looks promising. \n\nRest assured, Phu Thanh is different from most Vietnamese restaurants on the east side... it's very very bad. During a one-hour dinner in their dining room, I noticed three tables that were covered in dirty dishes upon my arrival, and still covered in the same dirty dishes upon my departure. Not to say this ruined my experience, but it sure was disgusting to look at. The waiter service here was actually nicer and more helpful than most, a which is the saving grace here. They offered a refill of my water (rare) and even came back to see if I needed anything else (very rare.) The clientele here seemed like predominately young married couples and young families of non-asian descent. \n\nI had been craving a bowl of Bun all day, a rice noodle dish served with julienned veggies, your choice of meat, and a nuoc mam (fish sauce) to give it a nice flavor. I also ordered spring rolls  prior to my meal, and was a tad surprised when, having ordered in Vietnamese, the server asked me questions that made no sense. My order of Goi Cuon garnered a respose of \""fried or not fried\"" which definitely threw me off since fried would be Gha Gio, an entirely different dish... did you ask this because I'm white? He then asked \""you need fork right?\"" No, I just gave you my entire order and said hello in conversational Vietnamese... this wasn't a tip off that I know how to eat your food? The spring rolls were very small and contained little filling. I'm used to Goi Cuon bursting with veggies pork and shrimp, not little tiny thunb sized things. When the Bun came, the noodles were all broken, which made it almost impossible to eat in anything other than tiny bites. The Nuoc Mam had an overwhelming fish sauce smell and flavor and was easily the worst I've ever had, and completely lacked chili, garlic, or anything to mask the fish sauce. Utterly awful. I also felt like the Bun portion was incredibly small compared to other Viet restaurants in town.\n\nI would hesitate to give this place any sort of recommendation, given it's proximity to some of the best Vietnamese restaurants in town. The quality seemed to be on par, and service was somewhat decent, but the combination of small portions, bad tasting food, and lack of ability to clean a table earns this restaurant a solid two-star review. Also, eating Vietnamese more than three times a week, I've had a good run of over two years and haven't become sick from a place. This one has had me burping for the past 12 hours and feeling kind of queasy... nothing major, but definitely something didn't sit well. I'm honstly not sure what the appeal of this restaurant is. Two miles away is Pho Ao Sen, one of the premier spots in the valley."
1,"Uber nice. \n\nFriday night was our mid-Strip assault. Heard good things about the Cosmo and Chandelier. So after Bellagio, we headed here. I got to admit, it is a pretty neat theme, a three story bar in a so called Chandelier. Over-the-top, faux crystals draped and covered the whole area. Kinda felt surreal. \n\nBeing Friday night, you can imagine this place was packed. The crowd was mainly on the younger side, 20's-30's, but there was a table of four middle aged women getting their drink on as well. Which I thought was fantastic. We grab some drinks and proceeded to find somewhere to sit. There was some tables that were marked \""reserved\"" but the rest was a free-for-all. We finally found seats in front of the bar on the second level. People watching and eavesdropping was nice. Bartenders provided good and friendly service. \n\nA worthwhile destination."
0,"Has Mammas changed ownership recently?\n\n\n Got a delivery at the weekend and the first thing I noticed was that it arrived in a generic box as opposed to a Mammas box. What was inside was just as generic (and soggy) and nothing like the Mammas pizzas I remember from the past.\n\n\n On the phone I was asked if I wanted spicy or mild but that didn't seem to translate to much on the plate. They may as well have asked if I wanted bland or blander.\n\n\n As for the Buffalo wings coated in Mammas secret spicy recipe and served with your choice of sauces, I think they may have waived a some BBQ sauce nearby but three of the wings didn;t even have any sauce on them. If they were coated in some secret spicy recipe I think the secret will be safe for a while.\n\n\n I used to like Mammas but will probably be taking my custom elsewhere in future. The one star is for the quick delivery."
1,"This is a real fun hidewaway in Phoenix.  You have to put it on your list and stop in now and then.  The staff and peeps there are really friendly and accommodating.  The food is also very good (unbeatable salad bar) and some pretty good steaks.  Had the ribs but did not care much for it.  Fun bar area as well if you go on a monday-thursday when they are not crowded (bar only holds about 10-12 or so).  Anyway, mark it in your books and we'll see you there!!"
0,Nice place.\nUnhappy receptionist.\nPoor housekeeping.\nPoor internet with charge of $20/night resort fee
0,"I went to Bar Cocoa last night with my family ( there were 5 of us including my 10yr old daughter). We were excited because we are a sweet crazed family! I was looking forward to some gelato even though it was a bit cold outside but sadly, out of the 5 flavors offered, none were to my liking. My favorite flavors are anything with chocolate or caramel but neither were offered. \n\nMy family immediately gravitated toward the cake display so I joined them. Two people purchased chocolate cupcakes, one a red velvet cupcake, another the pumpkin cheesecake and I got the coconut cake. The service at Bar Cocoa was great! The gentleman was friendly, smiling and very pleasant. At the bar they only offered coffee and hot chocolate. We were encouraged to grab a seat at the Ritz Carlton lounge area where we would be offered a wider selection of drinks.\n\nOur desserts were all just average tasting. No one, including myself, was wowed by anything. I usually love most coconut flavored anything but this cake was filled with big chunks of coconut flakes. I couldn't detect any actual cake in there at all. It was unpleasantly chewy. I don't recommend it.\n\nThe lounge in the Ritz was dimly lit with a beautiful stone fireplace toward the back where there is a second bar serving cocktails. The lounge area was fairly empty. There was one table occupied with a couple. My family and I sat down and were noticed by the female server as we walked in but she didn't approach our table. I found that odd but I waited. About 5 minutes later she went to the table with the couple and asked them if they wanted more drinks. She took their order, left, and promptly returned with their drinks. Then she left again without coming over to us. Another 5 minutes goes by and a second couple enters the lounge area with their desserts from Bar Cocoa. As as they're seated she approaches their table and asks if they want anything. Then she leaves again without even looking our way. At that point we were almost done and didn't want to stay any longer with such rude and dismissive service. \n\nI am not sure why she chose to ignore our table but I was extremely disappointed. I expected better from such an establishment. With mediocre desserts and horrible service I definitely won't be going back or bringing anymore guests with me when looking for a place to satisfy our sweet tooth. I give the two stars for the gentleman that served us our desserts."
0,"Oh my gosh....I am sitting in my hotel room right now and want to SCREAM. \n\nI am paying 275.00 a night for the Presidential Suite which is very large but oh so very outdated. The fixtures are all from the late 80's how i know is because there from the same year I was born! Its horrible! The Spa was full of spiders and orange....pretty sure it was white at one point. All the fixtures in the \""wet bar\"" are like a Taupe/Pink/Mauve and are squeaking soooooo loud right now! I feel like I'm on the set of Pretty Women urgggg I hated that time period! This place could be GREAT if they did some updates! \n\nSince its Thanksgiving no one is working and the High Class much praised kitchen is closed! At the friggin Hilton its closed! I could have stayed at the Ritz Carlton for less down the street but since my grandfathers High School reunion is here we figured why not....Cant be that bad I mean for crying out loud I'm used to Motel 6! \n\nThis is pretty bad! \n\nHowever what staff they have left down there is pretty nice!"
0,"My sister and I were driving around Buckeye looking at, good question, what were we looking at? All that looking made us hungry and being one in the mood for Chinese we spotted Great China. We parked and walking in to the place, it was a buffet, not something I usually choose but we decided to give it a try. Now mind you this is not an old restaurant but the booths and chairs were torn and warn as was the table top on the particular table we sat. The food was truly horrible, limp and flavourless. It was so bad we were laughing on our way out. What crossed my mind while sitting there and eating or pushing my food around was watching what I can only figure was the manager sitting at a table doing what might have been paperwork. I thought, look up man and see what you do not have here and change it. Another one of them thar boggles I get every now and again."

0,No coffee maker...no room service! Ridiculous!!   They were really ill-prepared for the charllotte marthon and serving hundreds of runners. No complementary water or fruit in the lobby. Ran out of coffee and checkout for runners was noon.
1,The workers here are so friendly. The one guy gave me advice to try something new and said if I didn't like it he would make me something else! Now that's awesome service. I like doing my homework here.
0,"This place used to be good. For some reason, the quality of their food has gone way down in the past couple weeks. My\nkids and I loved their Carne Asada Fries, especially since their fries were super crispy. Now, it's nothing but Carne Asadas atop soggy fries....what a disappointment. Also, had the Char Chicken Enchiladas...bland. No good flavors; unlike when we first started going here few months ago.\n\nIt's really sad that small businesses like this try hard to keep its doors open but can't understand that in order to do so, they have to keep the quality of their food up to par. Sorry to say, but we are not coming back unless they bring their food quality back up."
0,"I have never been more disappointed and felt more disrespected at a venue until this Memorial Day weekend (Saturday) trying to get into Hakkasan.  The staff we've encountered were unprofessional and carried this attitude as if they were better than anyone.  Two things happened this night that has left such a bad lasting impression that I will probably never set foot there again and spend a dime there and that is all because of the staff.\n\nFirst incident - We all bought presale tickets.  My sister wasn't able to go so my friend bought the ticket off her and had the email confirmation printed out.  The girl who was checking tickets accused my friend of hacking into the account to get my sister's ticket.  Seriously?  Who says that?  We had the confirmation with my friend's name transferred on there and it clearly matches her ID and the girl was being so rude we talked to another girl who noticed the situation and basically told us to not mind that girl and took one look at the ticket and let my friend in without question.\n\nSecond Incident - The \""head of security\"", I believe his name is \""Chris\"", checked my boyfriend's ID and took one look and said \""that's not you, you can't go in.\""  My boyfriend is turning 30 this year.  Yes, his ID picture was taken in high school and he looks darker and a bit skinnier in his ID but his face structure and everything looks just like him.  We tell the security that we can tell you the information on the ID and even showed other credit cards with my boyfriend's name on it and the guy simply responded \""I can take someone's ID and remember their information in 10 minutes too.\""  We told him we wanted to escalate to the manager and he said he is the manager, which is complete bull because no manager would have let this happen.  He wouldn't even give him a chance so we went and asked 5 other security guards if the ID looks like him and all agreed.  We went back to the \""head of security\"" and said we just asked 5 other people that works here and they all said it looks like him--why are YOU the only one giving us a hard time?  And he said \""because it's not him in the ID.\""  Are you kidding me?  Who do you think you are?  We were so shocked and upset that we didn't even want to go in anymore so we asked for a refund.  He would not give us a refund and said we had to get it online which is also complete bull and then completely turned his head and started chatting with his friend as if we didn't exist.\n\nAbsolutely terrible.  I'm in awe.  As upset as I am though, I do not wish Hakkasan failure--I hope management reads this review so they realize their staff is mistreating customers with utmost disrespect and belittling them and train their staff to be more professional and respectful.  Try getting some tips from Surrender because that's where we went the following night and honest to God, have never been more impressed with their level of customer service."
0,"As a big advocate for downtown restaurants, I'm glad to see Mamma Toledo's is doing sufficient business as to be unconcerned with inventory, variety, pricing or service. \n\nTonight, I stopped in to buy a whole pie. Sadly, but not uncommon to my experience, they didn't have any whole pies and what was available was VERY limited.  They did have 3/4th of an apple pie.  Whole pies are $19.00.  I offered $15 for it (more than 3/4th of the $19 whole pie price). The woman at the counter told me she could only sell me the pie at the per-piece price which came to $21.50.  I said thanks but no thanks.  I prefer the Pie Snob's pie anyway."
0,"Was at the Excalibur for Memorial day weekend (5 days total). Check in easy enough, however we were told we were getting a free upgrade! Lol carpet stained, smelled bad, beds were hard as rocks! Could have sworn it was a box spring. Sheets and pillows were filthy stained as well as the towels.  View was of the roof. Staff still enters room with privacy tag up to change linens with more stained linens. And no wi-fi had to hit up starbucks to get a signal. Who doesn't have wi-fi? Everywhere else had wi-fi.\n\n    Leavin tower every day we were harassed by people trying to sell time shares and dicount show tickets that were crap. (They say free but they are not.) Big scam. Every day it was same people and same pitch. Unrelenting\n\n     We did breakfast buffet,  unimpressive. And way overpriced. Had upset stomach the entire day after eating that food. It was all bland. Would have been better off eating mcdonalds every day. \n    \n     Gambling in Excalibur cocktail waitresses we're non existent,  but when you got one they were abrasive and by comparison of the other casinos very old and unattractive and rude to match. \n\n     The large pool was closed all but one day! But they kept the adult pool that you have to pay $10+ to get into open with 3 patrons (4 lifeguards). I would say bad idea. Drinks were super expensive bring at least $40 cash with you to drink at the pool. \n\n     I will probably never stay at the Excalibur again it is out dated and under staffed to keep up on the hotel and casino. This will contribute to further deterioration of the casino. (Resort fee?) Ha what resort? Small uprade to motel 6 but with a casino inside."
1,"For the price, The Signature is definitely one of the better non-casino hotels off the strip.\n\nWhen making a reservation, try to book a room in Tower 1. It's closer to the strip, has the gym, the lounge, and the Starbucks.\n\nCheck in was fast, and our luggage was sent up to the room immediately.\n\nIn room dining was affordable, the food came in nice portions and tasted great.\n\nFor the price I give everything 4.5/5 stars. We really loved the fully stocked kitchenette and large whirlpool tub. After a quick trip to the grocery store (though the bellman told us we could have groceries delivered to the hotel and room and service would send them up to our room) I was able to make steak and eggs, hash, grilled cheese sandwiches, and anything else we needed during out trip, which helped save on eating out.\n\nAfter a long night of clubbing in high heels, the whirlpool tub was the perfect cure to our aching feet. The tub looked clean when we first got there, but we had room service clean it while we were gone for good measure. While we were gone they also did our dishes, folded all our clothes left out, and left us extra towels and pillows.  \n\nWe drove anywhere we needed to be, so valet wasn't as ideal as a parking lot would have been in terms of timing since we were in a rush the first morning (you cant call for your car to be ready before you're downstairs). However, the bellman helping us check out helped speed things up a bit by taking our ticket down with out luggage while we got ready to check out.\n\nI'd say this place is perfect for those who aren't planning to walk up and down the strip or gamble too much. If you want to spend more time downtown and don't plan on driving, you'll be better of booking a room downtown."

Not the most gorgeous/ unique room I've ever been in, but very nice.\n\n+ The Bella suites are large enough to accommodate a number of adults comfortably.\n\n+ Convenient location, Strip-wise\n\n- Every single person I interacted with, except for the entertainment-type people (gondola people, cabana folks) had a TREMENDOUS attitude. I understand that everyone, even the high rollers, are dime a dozen in Vegas, but we are all still customers and it was shocking how expendable they considered us to be.\n\n- Not one person has a clue what is going on. Off the top of my head, we were told contradictory things by various staff no less than 5 times, including once where 4 different people told us 4 different things about receiving a package from the mail room.\n\n- None of us could get wifi to work\n\n- The safe in our room broke at check out. It took 45 minutes of speaking with people at the front desk for them to recognize this was an issue, yet they still suggested that \""in the future, everyone should leave valuables throughout and not just in one safe, so not everyone is 'held up'\"" - several times. It took over an hour for the safe to be drilled open, and people nearly missed their flights. This too was met with them encouraging that people prepare to leave for the airport earlier (two hours in advance, as opposed to an hour and a half). Here's a suggestion - how about you replace safes that break down all the time, as you said they do, and/or hire more than one repairman to fix them, when you have 7k rooms?\n\n- Housekeeping never showed, until the date we were checking out, when they knocked at the door at 9 am. On a Sunday.\n\n- $15 minimum tables. Hard to have a little fun as an amateur gambler.\n\n+/- There are a number of discounts, especially at the restaurants, that they are not up front about. Be sure to ask.\n\nNote: The restaurants in the hotel were really good (went to Bouchon twice, and a mexican place in the Canal Shoppes that had a pretty good happy hour), and the cabana was probably the most enjoyable part of our trip. The cabanas at the Venetian pool are directly next to overly-crowded, tiny-pool-ed Tao beach, and are significantly cheaper, yet you can still hear the DJ, and everyone is having a great time. Chase was our host and he was the only person at the Venetian who was fun and acted like he appreciated our business.\n\nOverall: if/ when I go back to Vegas, I would either stay in a cheaper/ more gimmicky hotel OR stay in one of the other supposedly big boys, but one where I know they will appreciate my business when I bring in 10 people who are all staying, eating, gambling, and clubbing all weekend."
1,"Stayed here for a day back in the Summer of 2007.  Pretty nice rooms and bathroom.  Flatscreen HD TV, nice view of the Luxor outside our window.  Pretty cheap since it's near the end of the strip.  Never been to the pool or the aquarium here, but everyone says it's nice even though you have to pay to check it out, unless you're staying here."
1,"Great cocktail selection, fancy atmosphere.  Reasonable price (martinis around $7).  The bartender was very attentive and the drinks were great.  If you're looking for a more \""hip\"" bar scene and want to be off-campus, check this place out."
0,Its airport food. Had the Cesar salad with chicken. My husband ordered a pizza with pepperoni.  My salad came 10 min before his pizza. I thought that was odd. By the time I finished his meal had finally arrived. My salad was very over dressed so make sure you ask for dressing on the side. His pizza was okay.  Would not come back.
1,"It's my first time to this sushi spot.  I had the \""all you can eat, dinner portion\""  \n\nThe servers were very helpful and attentive.  It's a little more but so worth it.    The sushi has been amazing!   I've eaten at other spots but this place has more choices on the menu.  Definitely will come back again."
1,"So good! I went to Montreal with a group of friends. We got a recommendation to go here for bagels. As born-and-raised New Yorkers, I can say we are always skeptical about non-NY bagels. But this place exceeded our expectations. Delicious bagels and huge portions. I would definitely recommend it"
0,"Overcooked pasta, check. Slopped on sauce. Check. Average garlic bread. Check. Crowds of families thinking it's fab. Whatever. \r\n\r\nLook people, al dente and toss the Alfredo on the noodle. It's not all bad, but if I want to go shabby chic and chow with the family it's okay. Not my deal, though. I like Italian served in sexy dark corners of the room with my honey."
0,"I booked this with my flight on southwest.com. I was very dissatisfied with my stay for many reasons. \nFirst the cleanliness of the room was substandard.  The chairs and carpet were very stained, which made me not want to take my shoes off and sit on a towel.  The shower curtain had what appeared to be bloody buggers on it and the vents were covered in buildup.  The bathroom drain didn't work very well , forcing me to finish my shower at a friends hotel down the strip. The nightmare came when I dropped my earring near the underside of the bed.  There was almost an inch of built-up dust and gunk under the bed.  The massive dust explained my allergies that made it very hard to get a good night's rest. I left with the feeling of a sinus infection from the filth in my room. I was extremely sick on the flight home due to this room. \nThe next frustrating aspect of my stay was the elevators.  I was in tower 3, which had 2 separate elevators.  Only 1 was functioning. This caused my waits to be at least 30+ minutes each time I wanted to leave my room.  I eventually discovered 5 more elevators that had access to my room and again I only noted 2 to be working. The wait was equal to the 30 minutes in this other area.   If I was physically capable to take the stairs I would have, but I hurt my ankle 5 hours into my stay in Las Vegas. \nThe cleanliness of the elevators was also very poor with a very dirty smell, almost too much to bear.\n\nMy room  was over $120 a night with the resort fee."
0,"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because our server did a really nice job.  \n\nThe food here is seriously overpriced and not very good in my opinion.  My pulled pork sandwich was $14.50 if I recall correctly.  \n\nYou can do much, much better.  I don't know whether BLT Burger (in the Mirage) has pulled pork sandwiches, but they do have killer gourmet hamburgers, and they don't cost $14.50.  Also, the service at BLT is very professional.  Pricing there (BLT) is a bargain given the quality of the food, the quality of the service, and the location.  \n\nDo yourself a favor.  Skip Gilley's at TI and walk next door to the Mirage and have a much nicer dining experience for less money at BLT."
0,"I'm not one for the spicy fare but my sister is!  The only problem I found was that even though the sushi was spicy, that was all I could taste!  I had to order a platter of sashimi special because I didn't want it spicy and it took a while for me to get an order of mussles.  When I did finally get it, it was very mayo-nasy which ruined it.  The best roll I had there was the NRES roll(I hope that's right) which had a nice garlic sauce to pour over it.  I probably will not be frequenting Spicy Tuna Sushi."
1,"I was enthusiastic to try this deli because of the positive reviews, but one in particular made me nervous. I hate reading a review that has slammed a place because it makes me reconsider trying them in the first place. Me and my husband stopped here on the way  to run some errands. We had a great experience. \n\nIt is clean and neat, with clear signs to help you order and a staff that is quick to acknowledge you and offer assistance. We enjoyed their personality. That gets a star. \n\n\""But the breads all taste like shit and are extremely doughy to the point of almost being wet, the meat is about as low-quality as I've ever tasted (think that $0.99 cent stuff you can pick up at the supermarket\"" What? I mustn't have eaten the same sandwich. Okay, the meat might not be Boar's Head quality, but it's fresh and tasty. I would buy that meat at my supermarket if I were making my own sandwich. Good enough for me. And the bread... I like mine soft, not a baguette. It sure wasn't doughy or wet. Neither was my husbands. It was FRESH. The quality, though not 5 star or world class, is something I might use in my own home and this gets another star. \n\n\""Your side is a choice of a ramekin of either mac salad or potato salad or a bag chips - a super-small bag of regular Lays, regular Lays, or regular Lays.\"" Um yeah. SO WHAT? Comparing them to Subway isn't fair here. Subway doesn't have potato salad, macaroni salad, or sliced pickles. They have chips. And I rather enjoyed the fact I didn't have to eat chips with my sandwich. I chose the potato salad. And it ROCKED. And for $5 my husband got chips AND a cookie. Their selection gets another star in my opinion. Bigger selection of meats, breads, cheeses, sandwiches, soups, breakfast sammys, etc. than subway. Let the chip thing slide. \n\n\""And why the hell can't I easily see the condiments available to be placed on the sandwich over the plexi-glass counter??? \"" Know whats funny? I've been to capriottis. They have rave reviews. Can you see over the counter? No. \n\n\""The only thing healthy to get is a turkey or roast beef or something like that with mustard.  At least at Subway I can get a buffalo chicken sandwich or something like that with my choice of chips.\"" Not really true here. Subway's bread is dried out and they aren't really THAT healthy. Their meat sucks. I had the New Yorker and it tasted BETTER than a buffalo chicken sandwich. And why are you so health conscious when you proclaim to need a selection of chips? No chips are healthy. Sorry. Heidi's doesn't fail. It rocks."
0,"Not very tasty, but if you're gonna get something get the albacore tuna melt sandwich & the tomato basil soup. Everything else was sucky such as the ribeye, salmon, veggies, and even the fries. How can you mess up french fries? Boo."
0,"I was born and raised in the Greater Seattle Area, but I don't consider myself a coffee snob. I don't even drink that much of it. My orders are always the same, tall soy latte with no flavor at 120 degrees. Such a simple order that is only improved (or unimproved as is the case here) by the type of soy milk used or the coffee beans. \n\nThis coffee stand is located inside of a mall and because of this most likely has a large overhead. That overhead gets passed on to me the consumer, naturally, and what should be a $2.50 drink becomes a $3.75 drink. Not a big deal normally, however, IT IS when the product being put in my cup and subsequently going down my throat is not even worth the cup that separates my hand from the scorching liquid within. \n\nTwo stars GJC."
0,"This is the worst Vegas hotel I've ever stayed at! The room smelled like mildew, the bathroom was filthy, and there were cobwebs in the corner of the room! The toilet had brown stains and the beds were two full sized ones with lumpy mattresses. On top of that, the staff was incredibly rude and had a lot of attitude, particularly the accounting/billing department! I will never be staying here again! Avoid at all costs!"
0,"Oh Bibi's! We could have been so good together!\n\nNever one to turn down a gander at a pretty bakery, I thought I'd just have a quick peek inside. Two macarons later, I was on my way. I got a huge whiff of cupcakey goodness walking through the door and was pretty taken by the lovely colourful baked goods lined up next to the counter.\n\nAfter reading mixed reviews about the cupcakes on Yelp, I decided to try a salted caramel and a raspberry macaron for \u00a31.75 each. I love macarons and have baked many in my time. These macaron shells were very bumpy, a bit too cake textured and the cream inside was very buttery and rich. Not only was the texture a bit off, but neither of the macarons tasted much like the flavours they claimed to be.\n\nAesthetically, this place is nice. The cupcakes and macarons all look very cute. Overall verdict? Just a bit too pricey for the quality of product that is offered."
0,"Super rude tellers!\n\nI tagged along earlier while my friend and her kid while they made a car payment. I had to deposit a check from one of my tenants anyhow, so it worked for me.\n\nThey went through the drive through initially, but just as my friend pulled up and started talking to the teller her two year old started screaming. Not exactly able to balance quieting the kid with filling out the deposit form and talking to the teller, she ended up pulling around to the front to go inside.\n\nThe kid is consoled, but what do we hear when walking inside? The drive through teller is talking smack about my friend to one of the other workers. Something about how it was \""so rude\"" for her to pull away before finishing the transaction. Excuse us for having a kid with us who can't time her outbursts more conveniently.\n\nThat's awkward....\n\nAnd it's all completely out of line. Seriously, Customer Service 101: Don't put down your customers when there's a non-zero chance that they could be standing right behind you.\n\nTwo stars for this location. I love UWCU, and I've had other, better experiences here in the past, but that comment in a semi-public area is really poor customer service and is pretty inexcusable."
0,This company is good at cleaning your pockets and that's it. Terrible experience even after they were sent back to re-clean. This company does business under numerous names so check out the phone  number - buyer definitely BEWARE - awful cleaning service.
1,Their veggie burger is absolutely delicious and the staff is super friendly !
1,"Great food, reasonable prices, happy servers and exceptional service! Had the biscuits and gravy this morning.   Very fresh, very good.  Normally I have the spaghetti and meatballs.   At $5.99 it is truly the best lunch value in town.  The servers are always happy and friendly."
0,"First time here in years and I must say that the quality of food has gone down hill dramatically.  Came looking for a specific game, from Gilbert, AZ mind you and they did not have my game on with sound. I understand we live in AZ and with the Cardinals but you have to accommodate all customers which they did not. They said and I quote \""This is what you got.\"". The quality of food has gone down as well. Spinach and artichoke dip had very little spinach and a whole lot, over abundance of artichoke.  Pick it up Dukes.  Very dissatisfied customer."
1,Went there for a afternoon lunch on a Saturday. It's really clean and the staff were welcoming an friendly. The food was great and the wine was wonderful. This is a great play for foodies or a now brunch with the girls. They have the items on the menu in the store which is a huge plus. Coming from Chicago where there are several now restaurants I would recommend this place.
0,"This place is okay. It used be nightclub called El Sinaloense. It still carries negative baggage from the previous ownership. The food is not the best, its edible, bit not the best. The Marchi singers are great entertainment. The first time I was here someone  attempt to sell me drugs from underneath the bathroom stall. It was a baggy with some white substance. They could of confused me for someone else and they panicked and took off running. Once the Marchi band leaves then they start the \""Banda\"" music after 7pm, that when all the drunks show up and start making fools of themselves. Please don't eat here."
0,Apparently you cannot order the traveler through the drive-through even though it does not state that anywhere on the menu and if you go inside to order the traveler the clerks get upset and sigh as though your an inconvenience to them.  No customer service.
0,"Ordered take out and it was 20 minutes late.  Understandable with as busy as they were one table was filled with no food on the table just empty containers watching the World Series.  I assume they had been there a while.  \n\nFried okra very small portion, nothing to rave about.  But they have a good ceaser salad, again very small.\n\nThe meat the pulled pork was actually shredded which I appreciate.  Just a little dry, very little smoke.  The chopped brisket was really dry, not quite leathery but close.  Again where is the smoke?  Okay marinated chicken is gonna make up for it.  The marinade shined through the absent smoke ring and again where is the smoke.  They had a smoker in there it must be broken.\n\nNothing made me even want to give this place another shot."
0,"For being such a big store, they have a very small entrance.  I've tried to go in here twice and there's always a gaggle of people crammed around the door trying to get in or out.  And I'm always suspicious of bike shops that don't have a bike rack so you can park your ride outside.  They're probably good people.  But this place seems like an expensive corporate time waster.  I'll try a local mom and pop shop next."
1,"Being a nurse, I am a little picky when choosing medical doctors or facilities.  I chose 1 World Medicine because they were in network for me and I was glad I did.  The doctors are all knowledgeable and the staff are pleasant and efficient.  I have also used the accupuncture in their office.  They can do xrays, lab draws and urgent care all in one location.  Dr. Joffe really cares about his patients.  I highly recommend them"
1,"Came here the other evening with the fam, it was pretty tasty. The lady behind the counter was super sweet too. We thoroughly enjoyed our frozen treats & left satisfied. Many good flavors & toppings to choose from. I can't wait to try Yogurtini next! :D"
1,I love this place and there drink menu the atmosphere is very nice and the locals are welcoming. I will go again! Probably become a regular! Love bands on weekends!
0,"DJ's are TERRIBLE and RUDE. I have come here for years but stopped and took my business and friends to Plan B (the better dance club of the two) for a fun time. The bartenders are not friendly and if you plan to request a song, well, don't plan on hearing it. My friends and I have been complaining about the DJ's for years.\n\nThe bar owners will invest in revamping their building and style over and over, yet they keep the same AWFUL DJ's. I would think that after all of the changes and updating to keep up with Plan B's competition, they would realize that people do not want to come here anymore because of the music. I would come here more if the music changed. House music played over and over gets old real quick."
1,"Chains are usually very predictable, usually on the negative side. However I find Pappadeaux probably from a quality and consistancy standpoint, the very best. I was reminded again today at lunch having a seafood gumbo and half a shrimp po boy which could be a whole sandwich anywhere else. Dinner is also great but can get rather pricey especially for a chain. However despite of that, it's worth going back. Just save your pennies for your next taste treat."
1,"During an outing with my boyfriend's mom, we needed to get our eye brows done for our last nights dinner and her last night in the United States.  She wanted to go to a salon that did waxing but when we came in the ladies said that they couldn't find the time for us.  So I yelped eye brow waxing and Javal Brow Bar came up.  \n\nUpon walking in, we then noticed that it they didn't do waxing for eye brows but my boyfriend's mother decided to give it a try anyways (personally I prefer threading over waxing).  The girls were nice and the wait was less to none.  \n\nSo in all, My eye brows look completely better 'cause I've been trying to grow them out so you can only imagine the strays and my boyfriend's mom liked the results."
0,I have to add this: on more than one occasion we've seen the cooks handling buns right after touching raw meat without washing hands or changing gloves. NOT SAFE!
0,"I was really excited about trying this place & I was using this as a night to break my diet... I should have stayed home & ate a salad. I ordered the Neptune's platter which was SUPPOSED to be fried fish, calamari & scallops. I got my plate & it had fish (which was fried in small pieces, I thought I would be getting a single piece...), calamari and shrimp... Shrimp? That wasn't even in the description. I asked our waitress where the scallops were. She asked the cook & replied, \""Oh we're out of scallops\"". If I had known that I would not have ordered the dish at all, I was really looking forward to scallops! (one of my favorite foods) That is just bad business not to tell a customer they're out of something and try to replace it with something else. It's kind of like ordering a steak and getting chicken - unacceptable. Besides this mistake the food was overly fried & not very good. The dish had deep fried vegetables (frozen) as a side (deep fried broccoli?) and dry cornbread (not good) The highlight of the meal was probably the ceviche appetizer. My friend got the blackened tuna & was not impressed either (left over half of it at the restaurant) The waitress was friendly & discounted the meal but she should have been aware if they were out of something. A 2 star rating is generous... I won't be rushing back after this experience. There are too many other good restaurants in Charlotte."
1,"Where do I begin with all the greatness the ARC offers. First of all the place is huge boasting tons of basketball courts, pools, and exercise equipment. The only complaint is the limited parking available during week nights, however once you get inside you can hardly tell it's packed because the place is so huge. The ARC also features a track on the upper level, which is a nice change from the treadmill. Can't wait for fall to go back!"
0,"When I pay $24 for a car wash, silly me, I expect my car to come back clean.\n\nI tried these folks today after a year of ignoring them because, last time, they left huge smudges on the windshield and mirrors, so I ended up having to go and wipe those down with Windex myself. \n\nToday, I go back - the usual window smudges are there, but now we get the additional joy of some sort of crap all over my door handles and passenger side door. When I pointed it out to the guy, instead of saying, \""Oh, sorry\"" and wiping it down properly, he argued, saying that it was just water spots. Well, fuckstick, if I wanted water spots on my car, I'd go a block further down Flamingo and use the machine for $7, instead of coming to you for over three times that. \n\nNope. Done with these clowns."
1,"One of the last remnants of the Jewish area in Mile End. Wilensky's \""light lunch\"" isnt...its smooshed beef baloney and cheese on a roll. All of it pressed like a Cuban. The place is more of a museum than a Jewish deli."
1,Pool Masters are great! They repaired my pool and give me the best weekly cleaning service. cheap and easy!
1,"Good decor and relaxed atmosphere.  Service was excellent - very friendly, engaging and attentive.  \n\nHad tomato basil soup to start which was quite good, and not served too hot.  Pulled pork sandwich was great, but the Kobe burger was better.  Will definitely be coming back."
1,"I must start this off with saying that Hillside Spot is one of my favorite restaurants in town and I consider a pleasant hidden gem of the city!  I like the food, the space, and the chai tea makes my world go round. \nWith that being said there are some serious reoccuring issues with this place that never seem to get fixed.  I know its lame to rip on service because any server can simply be having a bad day on any given time you are being served by them.  But they have some very consistent service issues. \n\nFirst, they have a beautiful, young, eclectic staff that seems to move around very fast and work pretty hard.  Sad to say, they are all learning the bad habits of each other and there is almost NO service factor present.  The in general tone of the servers isn't friendly and they don't go above and beyond.  \nI could list one hundred ways to change this around but there is only one key thing that really needs to be noted.  It looks like this place took out the middleman (bus boy) and the kitchen expeditor.  That is great, servers don't have to tip out so they get to keep all their tips.  But....now they are so focused on cleaning up they spend less time on other things.  The lack of a true kitchen expeditor guiding where the food goes and putting the last minute touches on the food that goes out is killing this place.  Most of the time you will find your server with his or her back turned to you while they are waiting around the island in the middle of their kitchen.  Its so crazy to have servers waiting around for food when there is so much they can do.  \nHire a kitchen guru.  Have your servers helping out at the front handing out free muffin samples to waiting guests.  Pick up straw and/or torta wrappers as people are dining. Fill that water glass before the end of the meal. Ask to heat up that pastry when someone orders it.  \nCome on Hillside.  Go beyond just asking what someone wants and then throwing it down in front of them! I'm a huge fan and I'm rooting for you."
0,"Little Las Vegas with all their cultural imitation crap, except without the fun."
1,"I got a speeding ticket and LV Traffic was the best way to eliminate the hassle.  There was really no reduction on my fine- I paid $50 for the attorney's fees and got $50 off of the ticket, but I don't have to do traffic school and I don't have any points on my record.  Subtracting a star because the correspondence stated that I would be able to call the court to set up a payment plan and when I called the court they said that it wasn't a possibility.  Joseph called me back instantly and apologized for the misinterpretation however and I thought that was great customer service.  Hopefully won't have a ticket again, but would definitely recommend and use their services again!"
0,"I am actually writing this review from my room at the hotel now.\n\nVery disapointed in this place.  My wife and I have been here for a week and even with the deal I got on our room I feel like I've overpaid.  In fact the only good thing about this place so far is that it was cheap.\n\n- Rooms are old and dirty.  I was told that some of the rooms have been renovated and are nice but not the room that we were given thats for sure.  Stains all over the carpets, bird droppings all over the balcony and balcony furniture.  Pretty gross.  Not to mention both the TVs were small, old and unwatchable which was actually a problem seeing how none of the pools were worth going to but more on those later.\n\n- Maid service was horrible and non-existant.  We have been for 5 days and have maid service only three times.  On the second time we happened to come back to our room while the maid was still there, she locked herself in our room and had both TVs on a spanish soap opera and was visibly annoyed that we wanted in to our room.  She didn't even \""clean\"" the room and simply changed out the towels and made the bed.  Bags for ice (the ice bucket was too dirty to use without one) were never replenished, garbage on top of the mini-bar was never removed and room service trays were not being picked up.  Our breakfast trays sit outside in the hot Arizona sun until the next morning when our new breakfast is delivered.  The plus side of this is that we had an entertaining bird fight outside our room last night.\n\n- Pools.  So they charge a 30$/day resort fee.  The theory here is that the 30/day gives us full access to the water park, pools, gym etc. which is a great idea although the water park is closed during the week, the gym is ok but the other pools... DISGUSTING.  More bird droppings everywhere and garbage in the water.  There is a pool that advertises a swim up bar.. sure there is something that looks like a bar.. but no alcohol or even an attendant to serve you.  Some of the pools have a phone you can use to order from a limited menu but they can't even get basic orders right.\n\n- Room Service.  Very limited menu and as with most places overpriced.  This plus they seem to not understand basic instructions like \""do not toast my sandwhich please\"".  My wife -- after THREE times asking for it to be made right finally gave up and just ate it as it was.\n\nThis place does have potential but apparently they are understaffed and those that do work here do not seem to care and it really needs updating and cleaning.\n\nWould not stay here again."
1,"I am not one to just give 5 stars to anyone but this place absolutely, positively deserves it! it was my first time visiting a Thai massage establishment and I am totally hooked after just one visit. Once you go into the back you really feel like you are on a mini vacation somewhere. So peaceful, quiet and relaxing. The whole experience was much more than i was expecting. The boyfriend and myself stopped in for some Thai foot massages and we left completely relaxed, happy and wanting to turn right back around for another session. Like I said, the experience was SO much more than what I was expecting..it was fantastic. I will be back Soon , for their Thai stretching/massage they offer. \n\nTotally affordable and totally awesome.\n\nYour feet do a lot for you EVERDAY... show them how much you appreciate all their hard work :)"
0,"I only write reviews to warn people about problems because I feel that business's these days should not be able to get away with shady practices since we have all this technology to spread information.  \n\nI go to Vegas around 6 times/year and usually stay at the Encore and occasionally at Cosmo.  I read many many reviews on how Cosmo charges you incorrectly and then the hassle that must be dealt with afterwards.  I stayed at Cosmo well over a month ago and after I got back I realized my credit card was charged extra.  After much deliberating I emailed them about the issue and they quickly responded telling me my card was \""erroneously\"" charged for the minibar and that it would be credited back.  Over a MONTH later and 3 e-mail exchanges, each one promising the amount will be credited back and I am still without the credit.  I read this EXACT problem in at least 2-3 other reviews (and I was just glancing) and now it happened to me.  Pretty shady for a \""5-star\"" establishment."
1,Best Price in Las Vegas for lunch Buffet.\n\nI love eating at an all you can eat buffet.\n\nI think this place is very good. I just come here to eat and save some money on my trip to vegas.\n\nThey have a wide variety of food to choose from.\n\nThey even have mongolian grill.\n\nIs just 1.5 miles off the strip.
1,We had a great Time at a team event. however one of our teammates was hurt pretty bad.I also hit a wall fairly hard and hurt my neck.The staff should recommend the use of the available neck pads to help avoid these type injuries.\nBe very aware of the risk of injury before you do this. It is about the same as playing football with a high school football team.
0,"isn't there only one \""L\"" in tequila ?????\n\ni usually make a point of avoiding airport food but astoundingly poor service from US AIRWAYS and we found ourselves stranded at SKY HARBOR long enough we couldn't avoid getting something in our tummies without risking the kids having a feed-me-now meltdown at thirty-eight thousand feet.\n\nwalked by the nearly full seating area at BLANCO TACOS and TEQUILA and most of the plates looked enticing enough to give the place a try.\n\nordered the SHORT RIB QUESADILLA and CHIPS and GUACAMOLE. the quesadilla was pretty much a greasy mess. the short ribs were grossly under seasoned and moist enough that the tortilla required a spoon and pile of napkins to eat and not in a good way.  \n\nthe CHIPS were pretty standard like something from the snack aisle at the local mega-mart but the guacamole was actually pretty good.\n\ni was trying to accommodate the kid's appetites and suspect the food would have been better with a different menu choices. i guess if you go to a place called TACOS and TEQUILLA and have neither you gotta assume some of the responsibility for a less than stellar experience ..."
1,"It's mall food-court food so there isn't much to say here, but regardless I am a big fan of Sarku Japan! \n\nEvery time I'm in Fashion Square this is where I'll grab a bite to eat. Compared to other fast-food style teriyaki places I really enjoy Sarku. They give you a generous portion all for around $6 after tax, the chicken is never over or undercooked, the service is nice and competent, and most important-- the food tastes good! Try the fried rice or noodles instead of the traditional white rice- it makes for a good substitution to any meal!"
0,worst customer service I've ever experienced.  I should have read these reviews before I walked in the door.  Needless to say i left while the useless staff member was cutting the bread (looked like he was in pain just having to do that).
0,"Bachi Burger has been on my list to go visit/eat in Vegas for a while now and since our family's timeshare is less than 10 mins away, we decided to stop by. We literally  just walked out of this place with my fianc\u00e9 and 2 young sons, one 8 and the other 3, and this is why....We saw how many people were waiting so we decided we'll just do takeout. It took a while for the hostess to even acknowledge us and when she did, she handed me the menu and told me we can order at the bar. Waited and waited...and waited for someone to finally greet me. Surprised how long it took given the fact there were so many waiters walking by, not even a hi/hello etc... FINALLY made eye contact with one of the three employees behind the bar BUT to only tell me that it'll be a 45 min wait for takeout the same as waiting to be seated! WTF is the point of takeout and on top of that, if that was the case someone (anyone) should've told us from the get and not have us wait around. No apology, no nothing! We ended up at McDonalds down the street and believe it or not, their customer service was 100xs better! So so so disappointed......"
1,"Four Seasons Vegas is still the true boutique hotel on the Strip.  There are now a handful of new hotels on the Strip for people who do not appreciate having a casino on the premises.  It started with the ultra modern, The Hotel, and spread to a number of properties in the City Center.  Nevertheless, neither the Mandarin Oriental nor the Encore offer the privacy and that true small hotel feel that the Four Seasons offers.  You will not get people that do not belong walking around the lobby.  Now that it has been remodeled, this Four Seasons is a true oasis for those desiring privacy while visiting Vegas.  The remodel is excellent.  The service is good, although the valets could improve, as they are a bit slow, and don't seem to display that Isadore Sharp instilled positive intensity.  The overall facilities, however, are what you would expect from Four Seasons."
1,"The zenith is easily the coolest restaurant I've ever been to.  The food is also fantastic.  I went for the sunday brunch - my god.  $10 for a main course and all you can eat sides.  The sesame cold noodles and 10 different types of vegan cakes, wow.  I had the tofu tacos - perfect.  I also had a bite of the ginger seitan - also delicious.  If I lived close, it would be a weekly haunt.\n\nPLEASE OPEN A ZENITH IN PHILADELPHIA.  thank you."
1,"There's a point in your life, when you think \""Man, I'm old.\""  It usually happens a few years after you say, \""I am not going to stand in a line, outside in the cold, just to go drink somewhere trendy.\""  Or, as it was for me, the day I finally DVR'd 60 Minutes.\n\nI was even tempted to give Hokkaido 5 stars, because it was just a really nice dining experience with our friends and their kids.  There is easy parking.  It's loud and kid-friendly.  I'm not even sure if the table next to us noticed our wailing baby.  And the service was pretty attentive, even though it was buffet style.  The staff was excellent about taking our plates and asking for refills, and friendly to boot.  Oh yeah, and it's BYOB - there is a beer place up the road, but it only sells it by the case.\n\nThe food itself isn't amazing.  There is a very good variety, likely to appease your Asian cravings.  There are some quite authentic Chinese dishes, too, you typically find at Dim Sum.  There are chicken legs, sticky rice with red bean, seaweed salad,steamed pork buns, and others.  You always have to assume the presence of other Asians in the restaurant has to confer some legitimacy to the food.  In reality, though, the food was mostly okay.\n\nLike I said in the beginning, though, as you get older, your priorities change.   Also, for two adults to eat for less than $40 total is pretty cost-effective.  They didn't charge our toddlers, unlike some other places (*ahem* Grand Concourse *ahem* for nearly $20 *ahem* to eat fries and cookies).  I can see this place being a go-to get together spot with other friends with kids\n\nWould I have preferred to eaten at Eleven or Meat & Potatoes, or NOLA?  YES!  Is that realistic with a party of four adults, two 2-year olds, and two 3-4 month olds?  NO!  And so as parents, we have to place convenience, expedience, and a if-my-kid-throws-a-tantrum-will-anyone-care atmosphere, above the tastiness of food.\n\nSometimes."
0,I've been to Max's many times over the years. I've always had their club sandwich which never disappointed me. Last Friday my wife and I tried the fish fry and we were very disappointed! We received one and a half pieces of fish. Who ever heard of half a piece? The fish wasn't that great either and the cole slaw was even worse! Last time for us!!!  :-(
0,"Called and asked if there was a wait for my wife and I to get spa pedicures. Lady avoided my question three times and assured me that I could get us in in 30 minutes. We get there and the place is packed. I asked again...is there a wait? Lady still avoids my question and sits us in the spa chair with our feet in the water. We sit...sit..sit..no one comes to start on us and my wife couldn't even pick out her color in advance. When we asked why we were waiting when I asked four times if there would be a wait, the lady said they're running behind. I said...uhh why didn't you just say that to begin with!? Why lie just to get us here!??? Avoid this place like the plague... Unethical business practices!!!"
1,"Fun bar to go with friends, but most people seem to be regulars and stick to their own groups so don't expect to meet anyone new. On weekends it's generally too packed to move, so you won't be mingling too much anyway, but the music is good and the drinks are reasonable, so it's certainly worth it.\n\nBest part: Happy Hour Monday-Friday!, 4:30-6:30pm. 40% off rail drinks and $3 for certain good tap beers, plus free chips and salsa, veggies and dip, cheese, and little smokies.  With the largest outdoor seating area during the warmer months, you certainly can't go wrong with Gennas for a drink or two after work."
1,"We just moved here from Seattle. We tried Floyd's after reading the reviews. It was small with a friendly and attentive staff. We tried to go a second night, but have trouble finding it. Our GPS kept taking us past it into the next Mall. It\""s well worth the effort however. No reservations accepted, but both times we went there, we got right in despite tHe full crowd. We had the chicken picatta: wonderful. The food is prepared just right. The salads are great (and large.) Easy to share. Wines are good, only by the glass. Our waitress didn't know if they have a corkage fee. The by-the-glass selections are fine however. Overall, hard to find but very good value with well pre.pared food in a fun environment. We'll definitely be back."
1,"Small warehouse near the stadium that serves a full bar and has TV's...yep, I'm a fan. There's always a lot going on here for pre-game, whether it's a last stop before going into the stadium or if this is your starting pre-game place. Tables scattered around outside near the little football field and you'll have a few vendors serving energy drinks, beer and BBQ. They also have the radio show of AM610 sports radio and you can hear Chris McClain's annoying voice, though the laughter is a little more tame than the morning show...ha!"
0,"Our bad experience started with the lady who answered when I called to set a resv. She sounded like she wasn't very happy and didn't make me feel good about planning to go to Delmonicos.  \nWe get there and the hostess simply said \""follow me\"" she did not make eye contact or even ask \""how's your evening?\"" She walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.  She sat us, gave us a napkin, said nothing at all, and walked away.  (Also they only have white napkins.. I'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)\nNext, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  Not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  After offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. Mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.\nOverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  We did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.\nFOOD:\nMy bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  My spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.\nI ordered my steak Oscar style.  The asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.\nWe also had a lobster tail each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  Drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.\nWe had the New Orleans style creamed spinach.. The only \""new Orleans\"" about it was the name.  The spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.\nFor the price there are many better options in Las Vegas (Mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  \nWe will surely never return."
1,"I FINALLY made an effort to visit NoDa Brewery, and what an evening I picked. It just happened to be their second anniversary. The place was absolutely crowded. \n\nI initially intended to sample a flight, but customers were two deep at the bar, so I postponed that experience for another time. \n\nI wanted to try two beers especially: the CoCo Loco and the Hop, Drop, and Roll. \n\nSince it was their anniversary, they had a special version of CoCo Loco, which was a Rum Barrel Aged Imperial Coco Loco. It was extremely smooth, dark, and refreshing. \n\nNoDa Brewing had several, one barrel, limited editions on tap to celebrate their anniversary. Tuesday, 10/29/13, would be a great time to visit NoDa Brewing.\n\nI also grabbed a four pack of Hop, Drop, and Roll in cans. I put one on ice when I got home and I paired it with several of Le's Sandwich: Banh Mi. The Hop, Drop, and Roll was extremely flavorful, with a strong hop character, but it wasn't overly bitter. I enjoyed this beer a lot, and I had to fight temptation to drink a second one. (I did enjoy a Fat Tire that I had in the fridge though. LOL)\n\nThe men's restroom was CLEAN. The table areas were CLEAN. The bar was CLEAN. \n\nI was too full to visit the on site food truck, doggone it!\n\nThere is plentiful overflow parking across the street, and that's where I parked. \n\nI will be back here soon for that flight that I promised myself. Plus, I really want to take their tour. \n\nThis was my initial experience with NoDa Brewing, but to quote Casablanca, I can already tell that \""this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\"""
1,"Great atmosphere and everything in the restaurant were clean, including the soy sauce bottle. The fish were really fresh. The owner introduced himself to us as well and recommended some delicious ponyu sauce sashimi. \n\nThe service was great, they were always there to refill your drinks and tea. Overall, I would really enjoy my visit and will come back again. Also, awesome hot sake!"
0,"cool place! it's a gas station/gift shop/restaurant/car wash/bakery! crazy! i will say it is upscale and over priced for the gifts.  but it has a bakery with fresh coffee, and small baked goods! met with my wife here, we grubbed the pulled pork sandwiches. was not impressed at all. there were hard bits and chunks in our sandwiches, and it just wasn't very tasty, meat was over cooked and really chewy. Expected way better pulled pork. I'm sure the other food is great, but if you can't master pulled pork at a BBQ place. i don't think i will be coming back."
1,"It's cheap and very basic, but has a good variety of curries at very low prices. And the portions are massive so you're probably best asking for take away and finish it off later. No airs and graces, no prevention, I've offend the staff very friendly on both occasions I've been here. It's mass produced food but you know what, there's something refreshing about this place's simplicity."
1,"This place is essentially your standard all you can eat Brazilian meat buffet.  I made the mistake of partaking in the bread, thereby filling me up substantially before the meat festivities began. I couldn't help it though, because that chimichurri sauce that comes served with the bread was so garlicky and delicious.\n\nBy the time the servers came around, I was nearly full from appetizers alone. Yes, I know I made the one cardinal mistake that one is not supposed to do when eating at an establishment such as this, but I have a weakness for the chimichurri which, by the way, goes great on the sirloin and lamb cuts."
1,I'm very picky about my eyebrows it has taken me years to find someone that Keeps them nice and arch and thick . In desperate need I thought id give them a try and best decision ever made! Jennifer is amazing at eyebrows I can't express that enough. She is the only one I trust with them and I've been going to her for over a year.

0,"$180 for two people. I didn't even pay and I'm still outraged they charge this amount. \n\nWhat a boring, dated tour! \nFirst, it's advertised as a paranormal experience, but the guide makes it clear immediately that it's more of an informative historical tour than anything else. ...O...kay?\nIt was also terribly disappointing that their main source is the discovery channel. The guide specifically said they won't even look into local stories, so no chance of this tour being updated if you've already participated once before! Basically, unless it's been already broadcasted on TV and researched by someone else, they're not interested in including it. \nI could have gone for some local folklore or creepy stories.... instead of hearing about how Elvis haunts the Hilton (as we drive by it lol)....Really? \nIt was just dull. \n\nThere were 4 locations, seemingly picked at random. I was really surprised by the lack of connections these people have after 9 years of putting on tours in Vegas. \nWhy are we talking about a haunted basement or backstage and not touring it for ourselves? Why are we standing outside of Red Foxx's house like a bunch of fools?? Side note: I was shocked to learn that no one even had the sense to talk to the security guard inside and ask if he's experienced anything unusual. The guide's response was basically \""Nah, the owners (of the tour) don't think it's necessary.\"" !?!?!?!?! \n\n\nWe all got our own set of dowsing rods.... kind of a pointless and misleading tool, if you ask me. And some handheld devices that seemed suspicious. On one of them, a red light would go off (I'm 75% convinced it was rigged to do so) and the driver, who was way too involved for whatever reason, would starting yelling: \""That's a ghost! That's a ghost!\""\nI'm all for people believing and having fun with it, but this was just silliness. \n\nThe first stop was at a pizza place for the \""pizza party\"" we found out about last minute. Um.... what? I'm sure that's tacked on into the price of the tour and honestly, it could really be dropped. I'm not on a tour to interact with other people, so I can't say I appreciated the whole \""let's get to know each other\"" session. For anyone wondering- It wasn't even at a place with a little history, or a backstory that would justify a stop there..and it was in a terrible area. \nOur guide was also Jack. Adorable, but lacked enthusiasm completely. We'd be let out of the van and he'd pretty much walk off. The *entire time* we were reminded how \""rare\"" it is to have only 5 people. It was to the point where it got uncomfortable because you could tell, had he known, he would have cancelled the tour. \n\nInside the van, the videos we were watching were hard to make out- and again, dated and of poor quality. They showed mostly short news clips and old pictures. A few pictures he claimed his \""boss\"" took. Um, no. The DailyMail did. Don't steal photos online and claim them as your own! \nFrom what I'm reading in reviews, their Mob themed tour overlaps with this one- same stories and one repeated location. \n\nI say, save your money and take your spouse out to dinner."
1,I'm just glad this place is staying open! I love having somewhere close to home to grab a beer. I've heard the food is great here but I stick to the liquids. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the crowd at the bar isn't as warm and friendly as it seemed when it was Stadium...I've gone 3 times and just casually said 'hey' to the person sitting next to me and it's turned out to be a weirdo. Not the restaurant's fault.
0,"Where do I begin??  Well my washing machine is under warranty through Home Depot ... NEVER AGAIN will I get an appliance from them, but that is another story.  As for Buy Rite, the third time my machine broke, the warranty called them out instead of the repair place I had the first two times.  Buy-Rite came out and looked at my machine for a whole 5 minutes and diagnosed it.  Waited a full week without a working machine before the repair company came back with a part, fixed it and tried to leave before testing the machine.  I had them run a cycle and wouldn't you know the machine did the same thing I initially called about.  \n\nI was told they'd have to go through the warranty for approval of the part (this was 3-19-14).  It's now the 28th and there has been no updates until I called them.  I was told they're still waiting for approval for the part.  I call my warranty and they confirm - still waiting on approval.  The kicker is, I was told the approval should only take two business days.  \n\nThe story gets better!!  \n\nOnce approval is made .. it will take 18-21 days to get the part.  I understand  Buy-Rite cannot be responsible for the warranty company claims department, but I can't help but wonder 1) when they turned in the claim and 2) when someone was going to call and give me an ETA of when my machine was going to be fixed.  \n\nIn the mean time I will be out of a washer for a good month and a half before the part will even arrive.   \n\nBased on the LACK of communication and the (quickness) amount of time they spend with the machine \""figuring out\"" what is wrong ... I would never call this place on my own for service of any appliance.\n\nIf I didn't have my machine under warranty, I'd assume by a new one through sears and than go through this again."
0,"We were going to try this place twice, but each time when\nI presented a local coupon they refused to accept it.\nI don't trust businesses like this who play games to try to\nget you into the restaurant ... kinda like bait & switch."
1,"Gets 4 stars because the brunch menu could have a little more variety, such as options for pancakes, price is moderate an reasonable to the portions and quality of food. I had the breakfast pizza which was different at first but I liked it alot by the 2nd slice. Also had the corned beef hash that I liked alot. Definitely came at a better time then my first time. Recommend to come for brunch or dinner. If your looking for a snack the \""in between\"" menu is good. I will be back for sure"
0,Burger ok but not a 7 dollar burger.  Truffle mayo didn't work and I tasted it all night.  Burger was dry and over cooked.  Getting out of the parking lot is a challenge.  Sam P.
1,"Pretty good place to go for a late dinner downtown. Food was simple, but tasty. Our server was AWESOME. We asked him places to recommend for drinks after, and he gave us about 15! He was energetic and really friendly. I'd come back here for sure!"
1,I used to go to this gym and I loved it! I would still be there if I still lived in the area. Everything is so clean and the staff is super friendly.
1,"Great food, & friendly service. I've tried several of their dishes, but prefer the lo-mein category; the children's lo-mein is actually quite good. Not sure why pei wei gets negative ratings, but I enjoy this place as much as I do Tott's Asian Diner. Both are great places to eat at. It'd be nice if pei wei had listed open/closed hours though."
1,"Finally, a Chinese restaurant outside of Chinatown worth going to. not to mention I only live 5 minutes away. here's what we ordered: ( crab rangoons, egg drop soup, salt n pepper wings, Szechuan beef and roast duck ). I give hole in the wall spots a try atleast once because you just never know and I'm glad I found this place. it's clean and they have friendly staff. Food came out fast and everything tasted good. little refinements here and there and this place will blossom."
1,"we were in the mood for sushi after my wifes half marathon in vegas, but the Todai buffet was closed. we accidentally found this place in the bottom of Bally's. \n\nthey do serve sushi, but we both had a chill so we opted for 2 of their soba noodle soups. i had the mushroom, the wife had the vegetable. they tasted like any other noodle shop soup....good/fine. \n\ni will say although i was fine with the food, i was surprised at the place itself. it is small....like 6 tables small. however...if your dinner patrons are all of the same ethnicity as the place itself, and the only language being spoken in the restaurant is that ethnicity, i feel like it might be pretty authentic. please don't judge, but based on that, i assume this place might be quite the real deal. alas, my japanese cultural experience is limited to an airport in tokyo, so forgive me. \n\nprices were decent and service was prompt."
1,"I am a fairly loyal Harris Teeter shopper, but have rarely gone to this location, as I have several closer to me.  Finding myself near this Teeter today after a lunch at Libretto's (across the parking lot), I stopped in for a few items that were on sale. \n\nLocated at the Corner of Johnston/521 and Ballantyne Commons Pkwy, this is a large Harris Teeter without being HUGE.  Parking is ample for the grocery store and the surrounding stores.\n\nAs of this writing, in June of 2013, they are currently doing a remodel and are down to 1 set of doors at one end of the store.  The current layout of the store is the typical Teet floor plan, but the signage is a little more updated.  Aisles were well marked, VIC savings were plainly marked on the items I was looking for.  For a late Sunday afternoon, there were plenty of registers open.  The woman who checked me out was very pleasant and I was quickly on my way.\n\nClean store (even with the remodeling going on) in an easily accessed location."
1,"Approximately three hours until the ripe old age of 27 hits me, after a long day of moving, we find ourselves in the Rogue. I am with the lovely Amber hoping to hell her plethora of visible tattoos will make it acceptable for me to be here by proxy. If not my cap proclaiming \""I am the Boss\"" certainly did the trick.\n\nBeing a divier place I decided to be one of the guys and have a Bud Light like the good old days (I don't remember it being that gross before). The bartender tells me I have to put my shirt inside out if I am going to drink Bud Light. I look down and realize that I am wearing my Guinness shirt from the OYE at Finnegan's. Embarrassing but the guy gets cool points for the comment. Afterward I switch to a safe Jack and Coke...and another and another etc.\n\nThe jukebox kicks some major ass here. Plenty of punk rock, rockabilly, old soul that sort of thing. \n\nThe Kevmo met up with us pulling into a front spot in his Subaru wagon and as he clicked the lock the beep drew some stares. Nice Grateful Dead shirt hippie. \n\nThe band that was supposed to play never showed (probably syphillus complications?) so they had a replacement band show up about 11. \n\nBomb Threat...yup that's the name of the band. They sound about like you would expect...screaming hard terrible wanna be punk rock.  \n\nAt 12:01 I decided that my first act as a 27 year old should probably be to throw some elbows in the mosh pit of a Bomb Threat show. I ended up covered in PBR as some guy who knew all the words to the songs decided to spray the shit all over the place. It was so ridiculously bad that it was fun.\n\nIn general I would advise avoiding bands playing here unless you have shitty taste in music, but otherwise this is a great spot.\n\nP.S. I think I am going to create a Rogue Bingo game. Items to check off:\n-Mohawk over 9 inches\n-Tiger Army apparel\n-Crimped hair\n-Misspelled tattoo\n-Person carrying more than three cans of PBR\n-Cardigan sweater\n-Tight girl pants on a guy\netc."
0,"I tried really hard to like this place, but in the end, no different than a Cantina Laredo. Table side guacamole was average compared to other places ( La Grande Orange has the best). Skirt steak tacos were good but were so heavy there is a reason why they only give you three quarter sized ones. Dessert was the most disappointing. The churros were soggy and the milkshake that came with it was terrible."

0,"What a dreadul experience.  I had reserved and prepaid via Hotwire but all these folks do is PUSH PUSH PUSH for extras and more money.  I could hear it all around me. My agent took the cake (think her name was Angela).  I was in Phoenix for a little over a day, and was running late (good old USAirways, landed early but the gate was not free and we were stuck on the runway for almost an hour) for a tight business deadline.\n\nWould I like an upgrade - \""we have a really nice BMW for you\"" - how much is that? An extra $99 per day on top of what I had paid - no thanks.  Well I can get you something more comfortable, or fun like a Jeep Wrangler.  NO thanks, I just want what I paid for.  How about an SUV - No thanks.  I just want the car I reserved (mid-size).  Well sorry - it will be a long wait - the ONLY car available (I was in a hurry) was the darned Wrangler (noisy POS that I totally did NOT want but she was determined to put me in) and then talked me into insurance before she would let me go - with taxes etc $85 for 28 hours.  Never again - I guess I'll book directly with Avis next time in Phoenix.  I never want to use Budget there again.  Thanks Angela"

0,"Horrible service. Workers are very rude and lack serious customer service skills. My drink just didnt taste right like the syrup was low on the machine. The woman at the window told me it was perfectly fine. Ok so I get home and something told me to look at my burger and low and behold my bread is moldy. And no it was not just burned bread! I threw it away and will never, ever, go back to this place. Thats what i get for wanting some fast food. BEWARE! These people are going to get someone sick and they are lucky I did not ingest any of this B*llsh*t! Fyi... Dont waste your money, time, or health here!!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!"
0,"I am writing this review based on what just occured between my co-worker and the supposed manager of this restaurant. My coworker ordered pho (take out) and when she opened the container and sifted through the pho, there was a bug. To ANYONE this has happened to (or even if it hasn't) this is incredibly disgusting to discover in your food.\n\nShe called to let them know what happend and was going to come back to get her money, when the \""manager\"" told her they didn't want her business and it wasn't their problem.\n\nThis is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable.  And it gets worse. My co-worker went back with another co-worker to bring the pho back so they could see for themselves and when they walked in, the container cracked/opened and the bag was filled with the pho, to which the manager said/yelled to them, \""get that sh*t out of here. I don't want it\"". He proceeded to argue with my coworkers and raise his voice in the restaurant. (while other customers were present)\n\nTHAT is how you run your business? Yelling AND swearing at a female customer in the middle of your restaurant because she brought to your attention your pho was insect ridden!?  \n\nGET THE HELL out of here.  DISGUSTING, and I (along with MANY MANY MANY employess that work downtown and used to go to this restaurant), will NEVER be back.\n\nYou are TRASH for speaking to a customer this way. \n\nSo if in fact the manager was involved with this encounter, I hope your doors soon close. And if this happened to be an employee posing as a manger, then I hope you lose your job and the real manager make drastic changes in the kitchen as well as your hiring process."
0,"I booked my daughters first birthday here.  We were promised in the $164 we paid a month prior, 10 free tickets for day of, a entertainer for 1 hour, party favors for the kids, and a free year membership for the birthday girl.  We were supposed to be there at 3:00 for the party to be at 330.  The party before us ran over, pushing our set up time to past the party start time.  Our guests had to wait out in the mall for almost a hour.  They gave us extra time at the end, which we didn't even use. We didn't have an entertainer, the guy that was supposed to be doing it was only there for a max of 10 min. No party favors, glad I made my own. No membership at all.  Then they wanted to charge me $170+ for the 10 people who were already part of the $164 plus the additional people who came to the party but didn't actually go through the aquarium or paid already. I for sure won't be going back for another party or to visit the aquarium, which is a shame cause my daughter loves watching the fish."
0,"I visited Madison with the plans to go to Greenbush Bar. I was very excited because they were said to have the best pizza this side of Chicago. I told several friends about the place, but was unable to go myself. My friends went* and told me about the terrible treatment they received there. Being the only people of color in the establishment, they were somehow conveniently only offered seating after all of the white customers. In fact, the bar gave their table away to a party with the same number of people, who again were conveniently white, with some excuse about air-conditioning. I guess to Greenbush Bar black people need air more than others? \n\nI'm sure it's easy to give out positive reviews to this place if they are willing to serve you, however, that becomes very difficult when the bar will not even offer you the same service as the other customers. In this case it would have been nothing more than a table and courteous service.   \n\n*Please read the review below by Maria J."

They had a 6 minute strep test that she did right away.  Amazing.  No \""sending it to the lab\"" and waiting.  Instant service.\nShe also verified my insurance on the spot as well as electronically sent my prescription to the pharmacy...saving me a step.\nGreat service and great idea."
0,"Everything about this place is gross. First of all, the hostess called our name and then started walking then FORGOT where were suppose to sit. Making us stand right in the middle of the restaurant. I got the ribeye steak and it was tender, juicy, and cooked well (NOT!!!) it was so hard and warm (more on the cold side). Close your eyes and imagine a hard piece of cardboard and some white slimy stuff. That's what was flopping on my plate. The salad tasted warm and not fresh. This place should shut down so we can put up a Houston's."
0,"Terrible experience. The girl who took the phone order was wonderful, the delivery guy was fast. But I paid 22 dollars plus a 6 dollar tip for 1 pasta entree... It was the linguini imperial and it was cold with no sauce... Literally it was obviously clams that have been cooked from a frozen state on top of linguini with 3 shrimp. No sauce, I had to reheat and season despite the quick delivery. Called, didn't want my money back just a credit. (It was my first and now my last time here.) Spoke to a manager who was also the disgruntled cook- he said he was unwilling to do anything for me. People with no customer service have no business managing a restaurant. Made both of his other two employees null and void. It didn't matter how nice they were, he ruined it."
1,"I've been here several times over the last few years on several different visits to Montreal. Each time I've thoroughly enjoyed my visit here. The place is extremely chill and laid back, with lots of nooks and crannies to sit in. The food is pretty good for bar food, and they even have several good vegetarian options. Beer is quite good, with several seasonals on offer in addition to the regular brews. The relaxed vibe and friendly staff ensure a great visit every time."
0,"Not Impressed at all! \nHad it not been for the gift card I had I probably would have never went here and after this visit I doubt I'll return. \n\nI'll just cut to the chase, they say they have fresh fish and seafood, \nwell if those coconut shrimp I ordered were \""Fresh\"" Then I'm the Gorton's Fisherman! \nI'm sorry but those were sadly frozen Sea-Pak (see pics) the sauce and mango salsa were atrocious. \n\nMy Salmon Club sandwich was OK (see pics) but the gunk in the center of the plate was a very poor excuse for some sort of salad, think cafeteria salad bar.\n\nThe Cheeseburger my daughter ordered arrived well done even though she ordered it medium. She says it was ok but far from the best she's had.\n\nFrom the looks of the restaurant I expected Much Better quality of food.\nOh Well, at least I know where not to spend my money."
1,The stuffed dates are really good! The desserts are good too and so is the service
0,"Magnum's has a nice selection of beers in virtually all categories that a beer enthusiast would want. Cigars and wine aren't bad either, and their new trendy cigar lounge is nice as well.\n\nAfter several visits I have found the service to be atrocious. For example, today I was there and suspected that my total was slightly off and so I politely requested the receipt. He corrected me by saying I already had it (the credit card receipt) and said that's all he could give me, then followed it up with a nasty look.   Since when is it not possible for a customer to receive an itemized receipt to confirm that there were no double charges or mischarges?\n\nBe careful for old or heat damaged product at Magnum's. Over 90% of their product is maintained at a warm room temperature (today it was 100+ degrees and the front door was open), and I've had several bad bottles from this place. If you stick to the refrigerated product you're less likely to get a bad one, and shopping in summer months can be more risky here as well.\n\nIf you're in the area Magnum's is worth the stop, but be careful what you buy and expect to be treated poorly."
1,"Went here with my fiances family  and this place was amazing. They are Sicilian, so you can only imagine how important real Italian food is to them. We had a party of 12, and they treated us so nicely .\nAnyway, the bathroom, has the BEST napkins I have ever dried my hands with! I know weird right, and apparently the men's has some pretty cool artwork above the urinals ( according to my fiance' ).\n The food is amazing, hot, yummy. Some of the family  had the raviolis, lasagna, sausage appetizer, salads, the shrimp linguine; all was superb. Will be going again when in Vegas. Like prior comments it is a chain restaurant but run like an original!\nThanks again for the lovely time!"
0,"DO NOT STAY HERE. The day we got here the room had a condom and paper plates. They changed our room and their was a pubic hair on the toilet seat. Also the morning we were leaving we found a bed bug in the room. The staff is not helpful, and extremely rude. You would think for a hotel in Vegas they would have some standards but they clearly do not. The valet also drove my car with the parking break on, which affected my car.\nAnd on top of it, we asked housekeeping NOT to come in our room over 3 times, and they still came in our room. \nThey refuse to help you. They do not think its even appropriate to refund your money. But judging on how the hotel is kept, they probably need it. Bed bugs are no joke, so please save yourself the headache and do not stay there."
1,"Don't let the outside of the this establishment fool you- a great local bar with really great food! My husband and I were shocked at how good the food was and the price tag did not break the bank. The portions were generous and there was a really wide selection. \nLoved that this was a more laid back atmosphere- I didn't like that our waitress also worked behind the bar. Since we were sitting in the dining room, she had to man the bar so she didn't have a lot of opportunity to check on us. But overall a great place to have a quiet affordable dinner with the family and still get very high quality food. \nTry the appetizer platter \""All In\"" - amazing!! Chips and salsa + 2 sliders + Chicken tenders + Buffalo wings + Mozzarella sticks!! WHAT?!?! 3 - 4 people could share this easily."
0,"It's always iffy regarding the daily delivery of the paper.  The circulation and delivery staff are inept and incompetent.  When you try to speak with staff regarding this problem, the publisher hides behind a Philippines phone service who lie to you that a supervisor will call you back.  That never happens.  I spoke to my delivery person who gave me the name and number of her supervisor in Charlotte, a Miss D.  The D must stand for Don't Deliver, Don't Call back and DUH, because I have left messages for her more than 10 times and NEVER received a call back.  The only time they call you is when they want money.  I am also told by my delivery person that because I live on the east side of town, the publisher doesn't really care about what we think or providing a decent service.  I am calling for the resignation or firing of the Circulation Manager who allows this third world behavior to happen.  The publisher, Ann Caulkins, thinks this is the Philippines and conducts business that way.  You're a local paper missy, deal with us as locals."
1,I've never had anything bad here. Great service. Great Cocktails. Great music. Great food.
0,"EDIT #2: I was there not too long ago and this place fell from grace. My former favorite dish, the bun bo hue was horrendous. The meat in it was so tough, I swear I was eating those leather tabs that is sometimes attached to new shoes. All I could do was just chew it enough to get the meat flavor out of it and then spit it out. \n\nI'm in Tucson now, but the next time I\""m in PHX, I'll definitely have to find another pho place."
1,"If you are a sandwich lover, you will enjoy this place!  They also have really yummy salads including a kale salad that is to die for!  Fresh spin on the typical sandwich, fresh ingredients, and a great atmosphere!  And the owner is super sweet and nice! What more can you ask for.  Oh yeah, the price is just right too!"
1,"No complaints for a vegas buffet. We were lucky and got a line pass so got to have less wait in the buffet line. After coming in, saw some nice options: Host of seafood including huge king crab legs, endless amounts of salad. the only one down-side was the peking duck was really old and tough. We ended up not eating any of that. also liked the prime rib. They also offered kobe beef as well. I am a big fan of the dessert section for this buffet. Dessert comprised of eating as many macaroons as they placed out. It was the Vanilla Macaroon and I couldn't help but go back for seconds. It was off the hook! Wish they had gelato like the Wicked spoon, but the bellagio buffet will always remain one of my fave Vegas buffets."
0,2nd review in this place. First time was 5 stars. Looks like it is under new management since last time I visited. Constantly trying to up sell. Tried to get an extra $10 for the clear coat. \n\nPlus now they have a window chip repair onsite- another up sell. Told me there were tiny chips in the windshield and wanted to change my insurance. \n\nDidn't even clean my cup holder. \n\nI will never go again. Find another place
0,"My wife brought my dogs to the Peoria location .what a nightmare , there she found a Dr lets just say he was scarey . They tried to RIP us OFF for over $1000 My lab was boarded just days before and had dyera and throwing up rather than checking for a Parasite he wanted to run a serus of tests that would run over $700 my other dog had a skin infection he wanted to test in the about $400 my wife walk out in tears took them to anther hospital to find that the lab had a parasite gave him a pill and he's in great shape 1day later \nThese So called Dr are there to take your money and could care less about the Animals they treat \nStay away unless you feel like th roughing your money away"
1,"Yes, I am reviewing a Circle K.  If you need ice chips post-throat surgery Circle K is your place.  Their ice is 'soft', like melt-in-your-mouth not hard-as-a-rock ice, and not like the ice-daggers that come out of your crushed ice dispenser on the fridge at home.  They also have cheap slurpies and Styrofoam cups to keep ice chips from melting!  I never knew these things were important until I needed them.  \n\nTo top it off the sales associate was extremely nice every time my sister or I went in there.  Even though I sounded like Kermit the frog and looked like death, they didn't make me feel like a weirdo.  \n\nThis store is not large and it is not a gas station,  but they have a decent selection and cheap drinks if you are on the go."
0,"I have a 2000 528i that was given to me by my mother. She has been taking it here for years. I have taken it back there for oil changes since I have owned the car for the last two year. I guess they are hard up for money now and are willing to make shit up so you have to spend money that you don't need too. I brought it in in the beginning of the year for an oil change. The woman in the front office gave me a list of things that need to be done to my car. She made it sound urgent to get this done. I told her when I get the money I'll bring it in. Well several months later I got some of the repairs done on her list by others. Went back again for an oil change and now never mind the oil leak (they claim I have so bad) , I seem to have to change the seal in the shifter. They gave me pictures and made it look official. The way the woman at the front desk was pushing and pressuring me to get at least the shifter seal fixed now, so at least they can get some money for me before they release the car to me. I had to beg her to please finish so I can get back to work. She wanted me to commit in getting the seal replaced. Well I decided to go somewhere else. Will come to find out THEY ARE LAIRS AND ALL THEY WANT IS YOUR MONEY!!!!!!. Found out I don't need a shifter seal change and the oil leak isn't as bad as they claim. I will never bring my car there again and will comment on every site I can. What has happen to customer service?????"
0,"This was the place to be around 2-3 years ago. But now its just Meh!. I came here this past weekend and they seem to make sure its really pack that you cant even breathe in there. The music is great, kudos to the DJs but the bartenders and bounces are rude and slow. \n\nWhy the heck to you get on VIP if you are going to wait 20 mins to get in. Redick!\nI like the asian inspired decor and the go go dancers but thats about it."
0,"Call in for an oil change and the dude tells me the next opening is on Dec 10th, today is nov 21st???  that is 3 weeks away??? off to someone else I guess."
1,"Best Vietnamese Food in Vegas. Spring rolls were on point just like their sister restaurant in Orange County, their seafood banh canh was flavorful, and their banh xeo was just up to par.\n\nStaff is friendly, restaurant is clean, and the owner is personable. \n\nI am so grateful now that I don't need to search for delicious Vietnamese food here in Vegas anymore!! \n\nAnd yes, it's located on Spring Mountain"
1,"Sunday morning treat taking my niece and her GF for the first time. Friendly associates throughout the shop even in the craze they all continue to smile. We got lemonade, strawberry shortcake, Oreo and the Prunella. The first couple bites are tasty, warm and not overly sweet but if you don't eat it right away there is an oily after taste. I only ate half of mine due to that after taste. Next time I'll share one so not to waste."
0,This is not a good spot if you like clean modern hotel rooms. I upgraded to an executive suite and the couch is so nasty as well the ceiling has the popcorn style. If I didn't already change one room today I would actually ask to be changed again. This is more of a large motel.
1,"Store is in Centennial Hills. So it is nice and clean. Associates when requested are always earger to help. \n\nLots of Sports apparel in the store. Dodger, Angel, and of course Running Rebel gear."
0,"I'm actually a pretty big fan of Paradise Bakery (high praise, by the way, for a chain establishment) and have eaten at several locations across the state of AZ. And I hope to high heaven that this location is THE worst of the entire franchise.\n\nWalked in for dinner on a Friday evening, and the place was like a ghost town. Now I know why. A quick glance around revealed that about 50% of the tables were covered with dirty dishes, some that looked like they had been left out for several hours. At this point the level of extreme suck had not yet registered in my brain, so I went ahead and ordered half of a Frontega Chicken panini with a cup of soup. Strike 2: no dinner roll with the soup. When my friend (who had also ordered soup) asked for the dinner roll that's always supposed to come with it, we were told that they had run out. Or something along those lines. The employees' English was remarkably bad. Though their Spanish was spot-on, as indicated by the cashier who rambled endlessly in Spanish to his coworkers as he took my payment. As a non-Spanish speaker and someone raised with proper etiquette, I found this to be incredibly rude.\n\nAfter sitting down at one of the few clean tables, I got up again and spent a good 5 minutes searching for a spoon, as all the spoon containers looked empty. When I told an employee that they were out of spoons, instead of simply getting some spoons and filling the containers (as if it's the hardest thing in the world to do), she picked up one of the seemingly empty containers, which contained 3 water-stained spoons at the very bottom, and wordlessly held it out to me.\n\nOn top of everything else, my panini tasted so strange that I left half of it uneaten. Perhaps it was due to the UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN.\n\nNeedless to say, I will NOT be returning to this location and if management happens to be reading this, might I HIGHLY recommend some much-needed staffing changes? Considering the part of town that this restaurant is in (northernmost edge of Scottsdale), I expected WAY better, well, everything. \n\nAll in all, I will NEVER recommend this particular location. It is ghetto with a capital G, H, E, T, T, and O. I cannot emphasize that enough."
0,"Having been in Anthem for 7 years and watching this place go through various owners and even before Ocho Locos was here, I've come to the conclusion that this place is cursed. Never have I had a good meal here. My most recent visit involved flies everywhere, and overpriced, mediocre food. I ordered Vegetarian tacos that consisted of a copious amount of guacamole, an equal amount of lettuce, and cheap shredded cheese. (After having to send it back for getting the wrong food.)  I took a couple bites and couldn't finish it. I sent my food back and went to Taco Bell."
1,"Great burgers, awesome chicken sandwiches, ginormous hotdogs, yummy shakes, and tasty condiments. The prices aren't too bad, for as much food as you get. We've been to this location plenty of times and never had any issues."
1,"This is such a wonderful park to bring the kids and family . So much to see and do. Great playgrounds and fields to play in. Also have a merry go round that plays disney music. And if you're a train fan, you'll love it here. Miniature trains to ride and a museum of toy trains everywhere. Great place and always clean"
1,"I finally made it here!!!!  I went with a group of 6, so we got a chef's tasting menu for $35 per head (pretty sweet deal).  I got the roasted green iced tea to start.  The food just kept coming so I hope I can remember it all.  I will have to come back with less than 5 people so I can order a la carte next time.\n\nWhen I got here, I sort of recognized the sushi chef, and he looked at me, but I could not place him.  He came out to talk to me, and remembered me from being a regular at The Ka before The Ka went waaaay downhill more than a year ago!  I was impressed.  His name is Hiro.  He was so kind and also came out to greet me before I left.\n\nBlah I know everyone has read that I don't eat pork, so I let everyone else eat the bacon-wrapped asparagus and pork cheek.  I did eat everything else though...fluke sashimi with ankimo (fish liver) and crunchy part of fish with spicy daikon, green onions, and ponzu.  Sliced thin like you see fugu sliced.  What's not to like?  Homemade tofu (like velvety cream) \""caprese\"" with seaweed and tomatoes, agedashi tofu with ikura, fish gutted at our table with daikon then the bones and head were fried and returned, skewered chicken wrapped in its skin - sooo juicy, skewered tender medium rare beef with garlic chips, nut-crusted tempura asparagus, fried chicken skin with spinach leaves and miso..the grand finale was a rice dish served in this big pot where the bottom crisped up the rice (we likey!!) with ikura, salmon flake, green onions, veggies...mmmmmm!!!  I am probably missing something.  We got hot tea at the end too.  Service was great, place is really small and intimate.  Extra points for matcha salt and shichimi togarashi on the tables!!!  I will definitely come back (who wouldn't?)"
1,Great vegetarian food! Had a good time sharing all the tapas with the family. The drinks were very good as well. \n\nThe one fish dish we ordered from the entree (with mango) was pretty bad - recommend you send the dish back to the cook if you aren't happy. \n\nOverall a pleasant experience - had to leave the strip but it's not that far.
0,"WE'RE GONNA BE ON FOOD NETWORK\n\nThat's great...let's see...whatcha got here that's good?\n\n[WHATEVER YOU'RE ABOUT TO ORDER] IS THE BEST\n\n(Answer was different for my friend who ordered before me)\n\nOkay, okay...catfish po' boy sounds good. And the catfish looked great, topped with red cabbage...but the taste was bland, bland, bland. No attempts made to season the batter it's fried in. Just covered with a mix of what could easily be mistaken as sweet mayo and some toned-down sriracha. The fries were way greasy and totally unsalted. I think it's totally groovy to get catfish on-the-go, but opportunity to add some kick to the lunch was totally squandered. Would pass over this food truck for one in this category that actually tries, like Jamburrito. \n\nDON'T FORGET WE'RE GONNA BE ON FOOD NETWORK\n\n*facepalm*...they're so annoying, too. -_-"
0,i wish i could give this place no stars. i went there on a sunday in august. guy of the moment and i decided to sit outside by the fountains where they have those lovely lucite chairs set up. there were 2 other couples outside having drinks we waited and waited for the cocktail waitress we had seen socializing with the bartender to come out and get our drink orders but she never came finally we had to go inside and order our drinks and the bartender told us that someone would be right out with them nothing fancy just a beer and a mojito. we waited and waited in the mean time the useless ass cocktail waitress manages to spill a drink on someone and break the glass way to go girlfriend. we waited some more until finally my guy went inside to see his opened beer sitting there waiting to served so he has to ask the bartender if that was his beer and where the mojito is? my cocktail was delivered by my guy the mojito was mediocre but at this point i just wanted to leave. we asked the cocktail waitress for the check but of course she didn't come back with it so we had to go back into the bar and ask the bartender for the check. it seemed like having having customers pained him or something. i just wanted to yell i'm sorry to disturb you but you fucking work here.
1,"I have 1 word for you: Scrambler!\nThis place is great. A tucked in little \""old time\"" cafe. some of the best big plate breakfast choices you will find in the Madison area. I always get the signature breakfast item, the Scrambler.\n It is multiple eggs combined with your choice of 1 item (or more for extra) including but not limited to, sausage, bacon, peppers, onion, mushroom....you name it pretty much and they will throw it in this fantastic concoction. All this on top of yanks (sliced soft potato's) covered is brown breakfast gravy and a ton of cheese!!!!!!!!! With bread.\nA ton of cheese, yes please!!!!!!!!!!\nA word to the wise, prepare yourself for a wait to sit down on the weekend, and football season is mad crazy since this little cafe is next to Camp Randall. On the week day, you should be just fine getting a decent booth seat.\n Fast service all the time, even when they are packed full. \nIf your in Madison, you have to hit this place up for Breakfast!"
1,"I love this place.   ;) so most that work here don't speak English well so they don't say much.  Not a bad thing, it is what it is.  The wide variety of food on the Buffet explains perfectly who is eating here.  Chicken feet.  Duck.  Crawfish. Butter shrimp.  Crab legs.  (The real reason to go) no crab at lunch only dinner.  Fri sat sun dinner is almost 25$ per person.  The signs all over the restaurant repeatedly say don't waste food so we can keep prices low.   Price used to be under 20$ per person couple years ago.  Waste and food costs are so high.  But still all you can eat crab legs.   No one offers that any more.  Sunday brunch buffets are pushing 40$ per person so I think the price here is still good!!! Don't expect 5 stars or excellence in dining.  It's a buffet.   But do leave a tip and enjoy a very good one at that!!!!"
0,"We were visiting Charlotte for a couple of days and were relying heavily on Yelp to lead the charge for dining - but this time it let us down.  \n\nThe Bad: I'm not sure if we were there on an off night or what (quite possible when looking at photos from other reviewers) - but the food just wasn't good.  Given the reviews - we were very surprised.  We started with cornbread and biscuits for the table - they had little flavor and were so heavy and greasy that when we ordered our meal we said no thanks to the bread option.  I ordered fried chicken w/ mac&chs, butter beans & collards.  The greens were good - but that was pretty much it.  The chicken was dry, the mac&cheese had the same old-oil taste the bread had and the butter beans were okay for being out of a can, but nothing special.  A friend order a Salmon special and she said that was good so I wish I had ordered that instead.  \n\nThe Good:  Service was good.  Attentive and friendly server took care of us.  The premise behind the restaurant is fabulous - giving back to the community.  But I would have rather given my $$ directly to their cause than spent it on the food."
1,This is a really fun dive bar. It's small but has a lot of personality. The wings are killer and they usually have some good deals on drinks. This place is great for what it is
1,Best kungpow chicken I ever had. But took off a star cuss should needed a lot of salt
1,Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae.
0,"I was reminded this morning why I prefer the Chandler location over this one.  \n\nMy breakfast (eggs & bacon with pancakes) was perfectly cooked, but was unfortunately left in the window for far too long.  By the time it got to me, everything was pretty room temperature.  The butter wouldn't even melt that well on the pancakes.  Very disappointing."
1,Whenever I have a craving for zankou in California I come to Stephanos. I was so excited to hear that they opened one closer to my house than the one next to unlv. \n\nMy favorites are the chicken or the filet mignon bowls. \n\nI love that they offer wheat pita bread and their garlic sauce is to die for. Super garlicky just how I like it. \n\nOne of the best if not the best Mediterranean food spots in vegas.
0,"Why I keep coming back to this place is a pure mystery. Maybe because I'm so afraid of getting food poisoning again or maybe I like menus without variety or flair. The last time we went here they ran out of spring rolls. I've made them at home and while they can be a little tricky, even whiteys like me can make them. So if the token Asian person has gone home for the day, someone could have made an effort to at least give it a try. Another thing that pisses me off at this place; you can order stuff from the coffee shop at the Pho side, but you can not order Pho at the Coffee Shop side. It's the same place and it boggles my mind. What if I wanted a side of toast with my Pho? Only if I enter through the correct door."
0,"Not sure how this is the first one star review of this place... but here goes.\n\nDriving home today, I wanted something QSRish, but without a drive thru since my three year old would have insisted on getting french fries. Since Wednesday is not Fry-day, except last week when Penn Central was giving them away for free, I wasn't about to alter course and give in to her jones for fries.\n\nSo, I decided get some take out from Asian 1. We had heard bad things about this place, but had never tried it before. I guess it was my duty to fall on the grenade to definitively put whatever nails in the coffin this place needed in our household.\n\nFirst off, this must be a money laundering front for the Chinese mob. There were two people in this place. It looked like the kitchen hadn't been used all day except to prepare lunch for these two. I have rarely seen people going in and out of this place, so it's not like today was an anomaly. I decided to go basic and order General Tso's because, how can you f*** up General Tso's right? It came with an egg roll and my choice of rice. Price was under $6... the ONLY positive.\n\nThe egg roll was among, if not the worst I've ever had. And this comment is coming from a man who has eaten Takee Outee egg rolls on Bourbon Street. Those were better. There wasn't enough sweet and sour sauce available to make this tasteless fried cylinder of wonton tasty.\n\nThen came the General Tso's. It wasn't even mall food court quality. It was pretty weak. Very little spice...like they sprinkled a bit of cayenne in their sweet and sour sauce. The meat was probably not chicken.. and if it was, it was McNugget quality. The flash frying of whomever provides the pre-cooked breaded chicken for this place pretty much reduced what meat was inside the breading to mere molecules.\n\nSeriously, if you are driving down Ardrey Kell and you want Asian, skip Asian 1 and go into Harris Teeter... pick up either frozen PF Changs or Wanchai Ferry. So what if you have to cook it yourself... it's a small price to pay versus getting food at Asian 1."
1,"This was my second time in this bar and I did wonder last night why I haven't come here more...I didn't come up with an answer by the way. It's a plush looking bar, really nicely decorated. We had a private room for a party, which wasn't so plush looking, but was still great for what we wanted. We had our own bar with a friendly staff member, dancefloor which was all lit up, toilets, and we were able to hook up our own music (though this wasn't necessarily a good thing as whoever brought their music didn't have the best taste. It was also too loud when trying to talk to people). It was a good sized space aswell for a party and there was lots of seating though no one really used it. I got the impression from the main bar that it would be harder to get seats as it looked very busy but then again it was a Saturday night.\n\nI definitely want to go back again in a few weeks when I've friends visiting from home and explore the other main areas of the Voodoo Rooms."
0,"i used to shop there all the time.  not so much anymore.  his prices have gone sky-high.  much higher than inflation in other stores.  that can't be good for business.  now when i go to food city, which has the best prices on produce, it's crowded with asians.  i wonder if they've stopped going to lee lee's too."
1,"The show exceeded my expectations it was intimate as described and just a wonderful all around show. We sat in the balcony but it still felt very close and had a great view in the center. Had we known that they run up and down the aisles hugging and kissing people on the main level, we would have definitely upgraded. Get an aisle seat it you want to see them up close and say hi. They spend a lot of time working the audience. Their performance was great, they talk in the middle with each other and joke about marriage and family life which is cute and personal. Enjoyed every minute of it. Her entire family was in the audience and so was his. Good people, rockin show!"
0,"We went down because of a huge write up in the SanTan newspaper.  To our disappointment this was a bad decision.  The food that was recommended by the staff was terrible.  It came to the table cold, once in forming the staff they didn't sound surprised or offer an excuse.  Then it came back to the table \""microwave\"" hot.  I would not recommend this place for anything."
0,"Ate here on a Friday night with a friend. When I drove up, I was a little worried as the area is very questionable. There was a sketchy-looking fellow just sitting waiting in a big SUV in the parking lot, so right away I was a bit unnerved.\nOnce inside, I felt a little better. The place was busy which is usually an okay sign.\n\nI ordered the 1 shrimp, 1 fish and chips combo. The shrimp was big and pretty good, the fish was your typical battered fillet without much flavor. I doused it in lemon juice and tartar sauce which helped a little. The fries could have been better. They kind of tasted like Ore-Ida fries from a frozen bag. So really the food part of the experience was just so-so at best, if not a bit bland. \n\nI do have a bone to pick with the presentation of the restaurant though. What's the story with the handwritten signs covering almost every empty space of the wall? 'Do this, don't do that..' it's like they are so afraid of being sued that they came up with every possible less-than-desirable scenario that could possible take place whilst eating out and made a sign for it. To me it just came across as grumpy management. And then there are the sub-par pixelated photos slapped on the back of the booths. It looks like they went to Kinkos, printed off whatever stock photo of a boat they found on Google and just stuck it to the back of the booths, stood back and said, \""that works.\"" \nAs a person who can't stand clutter, all of this together made me want to eat my tasteless food as quickly as possible and get back to my car and drive away, hopefully without being assaulted in the parking lot by said thug in the SUV.\n\nDO GO here if you are short on time, are on a budget and don't mind eating bland food in a cluttered chaotic restaurant, perhaps on your way to the ghetto strip club next door. DON'T GO here if you care about food and/or humanity."
0,"Went in for a friends birthday last night. The food, drinks, and our server were amazing and if it were not for the unfortunate experience with the management staff, I would have highly suggested this place to anyone. Because we had a larger party, they had explained while making the reservation that they could only do one check, but would take multiple forms of payment. When the check arrived, we went through, and wrote down what items went on which card, so the server would easily be able run each card for whatever the total would have been. A few minutes later the manager comes back, sets the cards back on the table with a calculator and says that they were not going to do the math for us, and to figure it out ourselves. After we did, I approached the managers again to explain how unprofessional and rude that was, given they have computers that could have easily done the math for them had they not chosen to be lazy. They went on to tell me that they were \""very clear\"" when we made the reservation that they were not going to split the check...which was not what we were asking them to do when asking them to do some basic math. They went on to tell me how \""lucky\"" we were that they even got our size group in on such short notice. (*Bear in mind we had 12 people at 10pm...there was so much room in the restaurant we could have been a walk-in party and they would have easily been able to get us right in, even without a reservation.) I have worked in the restaurant industry for the last 5 years, and when I explained that in my experience I had never worked at or been to a restaurant that would ever toss a calculator on a table and tell the guests to \""figure it out themselves,\"" the woman said she \""encouraged me to eat at those other restaurants then.\"" Im giving it 2 stars because the food and drinks were good, but dont waste your time at this place if you dont want to deal with lazy, rude management."
1,"I am a HUGE fan of Pinky's. It's definitely one of my go-to lunch/low-key dinner places. \n\nThe fried pickles are absolutely a must. I'd rather get them on the side of my burger than fries - they're that good. They're exactly the right ratio of salty pickle to crisp breading. \n\nYou also have to try at least one thing \""Ding Dong Style.\"" I would never have thought of putting peanut butter and saracha on a sandwich, but as a combo, it can't be beat! The Ding Dong Chicken is one of my favorites.\n\nThe wait staff is always fast, friendly and helpful, too, so it's a pleasure to grab a bite here."
0,"Awful, awful property. Where to start: Don't be fooled by their front office. The minute your signature is on that lease, customer service goes to hell. These units are infested with huge roaches, overrun by english illiterate immigrants (I actually heard the front office speaking to a resident regarding their social security number being registered to a dead person), and staffed by incompetent, unhelpful, degrading and rude excuses for human beings. Issues within my first 6 months have included lost packages after being delivered to the office, music being blasted (by the clubhouse) at such loud volumes as to rattle my windows and disrupt my sleep, (it took 5 calls to the office and 3 calls to 911 to resolve that issue), blatant pedophilia (our non-English speaking neighbor regularly hides in the stairwell with binoculars to view little girls at the pool - reported to the office, nothing was done) trash strewn all over walkways, stairwells, and parking areas, (again with no action from the office), unsupervised children going run-a-muck, (the fire department was here 4 days in a row to respond to blasting fire alarms that had been set off by these delinquent miscreants, and, the office claiming it could restrict my fiancee from visiting overnight. Paying rent with a credit or debit card costs $30+. The people running this office are without a doubt the rudest, most self-serving, ignorant people I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. Do yourself a favor and keep looking. Cheers! \n\nP.S Waterford Lakes - next time, just turn the damn music down :)"
1,"Been going to this practice for over 20 years.  Consistently great service from all, especially Sue & Rita at the front, Nan and Dr. Markham!  Always punctual!!  Dr. Markham even went so far as to replace a 2 year old filling at no charge, not because there was anything wrong with it but my teeth had moved and it needed to be built out.  You will not be disappointed.  Thanks guys."
0,"I don't understand the good reviews.  This is THE WORST food that I've had in a while. I should have known when I saw the bento box options were mostly American Chinese food. \n\nWe got chicken teriyaki and another order substitute beef.  The beef was tough!  And flavorless.  Plus there was something in it that looks like it could either be the stem root of an orange...or the eyeball of a small animal.  I'm not gonna look at it again because I'm sure (hope)  it's the former.  Veggies were also flavorless.  \n\nWe also ordered the Eagle and Angel rolls:  horrible.  The \""crunch\"" in the rolls were like stale bread crumbs, so the rolls were soggy and gross.\n\nI really hope that this review is published because, for some odd reason, most of the negative reviews are hidden.  \n\nDon't eat here."

0,"I effing hate this place. Of course, I was in grad school and not an undergrad. I guess if you are just turning 21 and have nothing to compare an inexperienced nightlife to, perhaps this place could be one of those places for you. However, for all others that have lounged in NYC or upper Chicago, this place is loud, sticky, smelly, and just a big meat market for international students. I am an ethnic Asian myself, however, it was a big turn off when they acted very pretentious (like u \""made it in life\"") because you are partying and seen at Clybourne on fucking Green St. I found the whole demographics off in this place. It just boiled down to slutty drunk Asian girls and the yellow fever people chasing a wanna be geisha into the smoke and mirrors dance floor. All around sloppy. Pass."
0,"I went to Jet with three guys... not an idea situation since clubs in Vegas basically hate men. \n\nI happened to be in Vegas for work the same week my 21-year-old brother came to town for some reunion drunk fest with all the people he did a semester with in Spain. We also happened to be in the same hotel. I didn't mind, I love my little bro and some of his friends look like the runners up for the cast of Twilight. Plus, we had passes. Even with them we endured the \""Vegas Game\"" where you get the evil eye for bringing too many guys with you. The passes did make the process a lot easier, since we didn't have to wait in that mob of desperate people. Sorry, no offense. If my friend hadn't gone to high school with one of the employees, we'd have been right there with you. \n\nI don't know what to say about this place really, but I think something my brother said best describes it. As we made our way through the sea of people gyrating in the strobe lights my brother goes, \""This would be a lot better on drugs.\"" It's true. It really is and I don't even do drugs. \n\nThe first stop was the bar, surprisingly easy to get a drink compared to other places I've been.  I wanted to be a nice big sis and buy my little brother a drink because his drunk ass lost the discount card my friend's hookup gave him and he had to pay something like $35 just to get in.  Unfortunately, he wanted a Long Island. They're fifty dollars at Jet?! For fifty dollars I better be getting the alcohol equivalent of an entire bottle.  \n\nEvery time I go to a Vegas club I wish I had just gone to O'sheas, listened to the live band, and played $5 craps.  When will I learn?"
0,"I was super excited to finally have a chic place to brunch in University City but unfortunately this place was a disappointment. It is possible that they just didn't have everything together because it was their first weekend serving brunch but overall the menu seemed a little ambitious for the chef's abilities. \n\nFirst, almost everything is a la carte so if you order a waffle then you just get a waffle. Same with the french toast. The sides are $2.99 each so if you want bacon and eggs on the side the meal will be nearly $20. \n\nI got the salmon eggs benedict with a red pepper hollandaise sauce. It was interesting mainly because they use a biscuit as the base instead of an english muffin. I ended up eating the salmon and eggs and leaving the biscuit behind. I swapped out my home fries for the asiago grits but they were too cheesy and lumpy. My friend got the red velvet waffle and she said the waffle itself wasn't very flavorful but there was a ton of chocolate sauce on top. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't return for the brunch."
1,"Yesterday I decided it was time to introduce another friend to one of my favorite restaurants in the East valley.  We went to the Tempe location which is a lot farther away from home than the Mesa location.   But that doesn't matter because the drive is always worth it.  I like this location because it is the original.  \nThis time I decided to skip the appetizer to save room for dessert.  I still had the usual very large Hoegaarden to start and ordered the very new and not on the menu \""Spicy BBQ Chicken Pasty\"". Anything with spicy and BBQ deserves a shot and it was delicious.  \nThe chicken was tender and juicy, the BBQ sauce had some kick to it, the jalape\u00f1o and grilled onions were a great touch.  I am not sure yet if this may be a new favorite but if it weren't, it would be a close second.  Only one thing could make this night more perfect....well....maybe two things but I will settle for the Banoffee pie.\nIt has been a while since I had the Banoffee pie and I don't know why.  Who doesn't love graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, bananas and fresh whipped cream?  With every spoon full you get everything, the crust is incredible, the caramel is sweet, the whipped cream is delicious and the bananas are perfect.  I was only able to eat half of it so I brought the other half home with me.\nAnother perfect meal from a great place to eat, drink and be satisfied....anywho.  I know it's 7 am but I am heading to the refrigerator for the other half of my Banoffee pie."
0,worst buffet for this price
0,"Thought I would give the Hula another try. Had the pork sandwich with coleslaw. Short story is the pork was tough as leather and hard to chew. The Mai Tai was a little on the lite side and tart side as well. The server was nice, but after the food was delivered to the table, he disappeared. Can't say that Hula will be a return visit, but who knows."
1,"Helpful, knowledgeable in their diagnosis of my vehicle. I came in with 4 different codes from the smog people. I braced for the price when Darrel came to talk to me and was relieved that my problem was as simple as the wrong oil used by the people who did my oil change. He explained each code and said that if we could set P0014 by my driving my vehicle to reset the monitors that I could probably pass smog and we could work on the other 3 codes at a later date."
0,"We had a Groupon...my wife loves Australia...and has family from there. Let's just say...we were excited. We ordered all the unique items: surf&turf (with Kangaroo-loin meat), shrimp-on-the-barbie, and the crocodile dumplings. The dumplings were nothing special...a bit over-seasoned and fried from what seemed like pre-packaged, frozen dumplings from Costco. The main dishes looked great...but the shrimp was a bit \""old\""...the loin was bland and tough...the small side salad was a delicious bit of redemption, however, with a sweet, creamy-in-texture, balsamic vinaigrette of sorts. With all that mediocrity, I must admit that the wine was delicious (we had the Shiraz and the CabSav)...and the bar gave an extremely generous pour for the price.  I hope they up their game, because there is a lot of potential."
1,"Dumpy place, DELICIOUS food. Honestly, who cares what this place looks like. We ordered our food, sat at a table and waited for our number to be called. My kids were skeptical at first but the waft of greasy, deep fried burritos reached their nostrils and all sense of doubt faded in the blink of an eye. Mmmm, mmm, mmmmm....chimichanga heaven. Even though this place is clearly not a 5 star restaurant, I highly recommend it to everyone."
0,"My son and I told our server we were going to put some nickels in the juke box.  Less than two minutes later we returned to our seats which had been cleared of our meal, our souvenir movie cups put in the trash, and new people seated at our seats.  The server handed me my bill and said sorry, bus boy took your stuff.  The manager was nice about it and refunded our meal, gave us a coupon for a free burger.  My son thinks it is fun so we will go back but be warned, don't leave your seat even if you let your server know.  You could end up losing more than your movie cups!"
0,"Food was good, but the hostess was a piece of work and the bus boy had an attitude.  The flatbread pizza and cheeseburger was good, this is the third time I have been there over the past year.  I have never been disappointed with the food.  \n\nI am not sure I'd go back based on the level of customer service that I received while I dined there, Vegas has too many other good restaurants with employees that want your business."
1,"This place is AWE-SOME for gaming geeks like me! Right when you walk in they have the classic arcade The House of the Dead, it is so much fun. I was surprised to see that they had a game lounge including a clothing line. That is plus. Even though I did not buy anything the first time I went the second time I took my time to look through the games they offer. They have every classic game that you can think of apart from some really rare ones. They have a large selection of games used, new, and classic games. If you are looking for a nice place to show your friends the Gaming Zone is the new place in Tempe. I got to meet the owners Alejandro and Jorge truly they enjoy what they do."
0,The sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the amount of money that I spent. there are a ton of more delicious sushi elsewhere for the fraction of the cost that I spent on my group of friends for dinner here. I guess you pay for location not food !
1,"I have been living in Las Vegas for 16 years and it took me \n14 years to find someone that cares about my hair as much as I do! Seth is not only brilliant at what he does he so passionate and cares about what he is doing. He is NOT one of these stylist that will do what ever you want to your hair, if it is not going to look good he will tell you, not once have I walked out of his place with a bad cut or colour, if you need something new or just a trim PLEASE check him out he will do wonders to your hair......"
0,This is a big park in the middle of the city.\n\nThat is nice.  \n\nThe dog park here is LAMER THAN LAME CAN BE!  There is ZERO grass only gravel and no drinking fountain.   Worthless.
0,"This was a real disappointment.  While it is in a great location - right downtown Charlotte, the food was pretty mediocre. I ordered the grilled Ceaser salad with pulled pork. There was a good amount of meat, but it was dry and pretty bland. The salad was watery and I saw no evidence of the \""slightly charred\"" lettuce leafs. I tasted my friend's brisket , and it was even drier than my pulled pork. \n\nThe service was ok, but if you want some good BBQ, I'd steer clear of this restaurant."

0,"I went with my girl friend for lunch there today, for the first time.\n\nThe food was below standards, the service was terrible.\n\n1. The waitress brought me back a different salad than what I asked for\n2. She used her bare hands to pick up my brownie from the platter and put it in a to-go box!!! Eeeww!\n3. She charged me for the wrong item (more expensive) and did not bother to change the bill after I pointed that out to her!\n4. Made my friend and I wait 15 minutes for the check, while making conversations with other customers!\n5. She brought back the flour tortilla wraps to the customers next to us although they asked for lettuce wraps because of wheat allergy!\n6. The salad greens were not just wilted, certain parts were decomposing!\n7. The brownie was worse than Denny's.\n\nI would not go there again."
0,"Anyone who gave this place even one star, has to be the owner or a relative!!! Worst food ever!!!! We took one bite(cheese steak and hamburger- they gave use the wrong burger on top of that!!) HORRIBLE, and through it out!!! Nasty taste, cheap hamburgers, no meat on cheese steak and had a horrible taste-"
1,5 star service. We must have had about 5 people waiting on us at all time. RANDY was the best server I have had in a very long time. TOP NOTCH. The $69 filet is worth every penny. The bison was delicious and I love the server who helped us order a bottle of wine. I'd go back in a heartbeat! It is absolutely beautiful inside! Loved sitting in the lounge after dinner.
0,"What do you give a Las Vegas hotel that lacks that special Las Vegas energy? Maybe 3.5 stars. What do you give a Las Vegas hotel that has the worst pillows ever created?  Maybe deduct a half-point for that because the beds were okay...but my neck is in serious need of an adjustment. Lastly, what do you give a Las Vegas hotel where the front desk staff treats you like your money should be spent elsewhere? I will give that 2-stars for failing to remotely put together a successful guest experience; meaning, I will never go back.  It would be 1-star but the rooms were clean and that sits highly on my radar.\n\nWhen arriving at the Delano for check-in around 10am on Friday, September 12th, we were greeted by valet requiring us to pay a $20 \""cover charge\"" for our vehicle.  No thanks. So we decided to self-park.  I guess that's the norm for staying at a place without an attached casino, even though they certainly know we would be visiting the one at Mandalay Bay - so I feel that we shouldn't have been charged.  We are paying resort fees even though it is just a hotel with no pool.  It has shared use of the Mandalay Bay facility so I am okay with a resort fee but the $20 \""cover charge\"" for parking need not apply.  It also hurts the valet staff's tips.  Anyway, I digress...they had self-park so let's move on.\n\nHere's where I wish I took names but I was exhausted from the late night and 4-hour drive from Scottsdale with a friend.  When we walked toward registration, I found a very nice but very sterile atmosphere; much unlike the energy I get from checking in at other hotels in Vegas.  It was like the place had no pulse; with minimalist lighting and mid-tempo house music playing to really accentuate the air of elitism of staying at such a posh property.  It was more of a martini ultra-lounge than a Las Vegas hotel.  \n\nWe were called to check in, and although the girl was seemingly nice; I got an immediate condescending vibe from her because we didn't know the Mayweather fight was in town that weekend (we were there to celebrate a friend's upcoming wedding; and as a disclaimer, we are all in our mid-30's - not 22 year old frat boys).  In any event, she had our room available a little bit early and we were able to get up there to set up.  Our bags were delivered in quick fashion by the friendly bell staff.  The rooms were spacious and bright but still without a pulse.  I liked the Bluetooth audio system and a plethora of televisions in the two separate rooms - with a 3rd in the huge bathroom.  All in all, I had no issue with the suite, which came complete with a wet bar and mini-fridge.  The only issue I had was with the pillows and I see many posted about them.  Not only were they too firm, they were also very tall so your neck was in an awful position.  The pillows negated all of the good sleep that the bed would have been responsible for.  Let's just say we woke up not very well-rested; not something to be missed during a trip to Las Vegas.\n\nWhen it came time to leave, we went down to check out and noticed some upgrade charges on our bill.  I guess when one of the guys of our group booked, it was originally at the Mandalay Bay property, but there were no suites available so he upgraded to the Delano.  It was a nice suite, but in hindsight, we would have been happy with 3 rooms at the Mandalay Bay with no additional upgrade fees.  Anyway, our friend saw this and decided to pay our balance for us.  We had my card on the room but the guy checking us out had an issue that my friend wanted to pay.  He said he needed to see the credit card of the guy paying even though he asked to put the balance on his room instead of ours.  Okay that's fine; but he proceeded to talk down to the group saying to our friend \""Why is it so imperative you pay the room for these people?\"" right in front of us.  I stated \""It's because we're friends, that's what friends do.\""  His response? \""You're not friends, you're guests.\""  He may have misconstrued the direction of my comments, but still his comments were not only unnecessary, but not welcomed by anyone spending that kind of money at a hotel. As a 3rd generation hotelier myself, I think you should treat guests as friends.  Our check-out experience was the nail in the coffin for me and the rest of the group. I enjoyed my time in Vegas (my 7th visit there in as many years), but will not be returning to the Delano.\n\nAs for the Delano management who sees this, I will be sure to get you name of the gentleman at the front desk who should be relieved of his duties.  Let's just say he's Asian and was working on September 15, around our 9am check out time."
1,I'm not real easy to impress but I do like this place a nice relaxed crowd a good selection of dance music and Beautiful Women Every ware! A must stop place for sure just be for warned drinks are not cheap!!! but you are in Vegas! surrounded by beautiful women! be aware they do have a dress code
0,"Really?  This place is called Yellowtail and they don't have hamachi kama on the menu.  If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  The service was HORRIBLE and the food was just as bad.  \n\nHere's why:\n1)  It took an hour to get our food after ordering.  We saw some of our group's plates just sitting there for awhile before our waitress decided to bring them to us.\n2.  Our hot food was not hot anymore by the time it reached the table.\n3.  The waitress got my friend's order wrong.\n4.  The fish on our rainbow roll was not fresh.  It actually look \""wilted\"" (for lack of a better term).\n5.  At the near end of our meal, my other friend still did not get her roll.  She was told it was going to be another 10 minutes since the twin volcano roll takes long to bake.  Really?\n6.  Some of our bills were incorrect (but thankfully no gratuity was added).\n7.  The waitress tried to guilt trip my husband about the $1 tip we left (it was actually $2...which she didn't even deserve and I wish we could take it back).\n8.  All this...and we were the only people in the restaurant.\n\nI'll never come back here."
1,"Mosaic is a gorgeous restaurant in North Scottsdale, near Pinnacle Peak. I imagine that they have magnificent views of the desert and mountains when it's still light out. The dining room is pretty small, so I'd recommend reservations. If you can't get reservations, I'd caution against dining in the lounge. Although they serve the full menu there, the lounge is actually in its own room and usually pretty empty, so it would detract from the whole experience. The service here is pretty close to perfect - these are professionals, the kind of staff that's trained to stop and step aside as you walk past them, even if they're not in your way at all. The gourmet cuisine here is great - not as inventive as Binkley's, but just as well executed. The menu changes often, so I can't really recommend any particular dishes, other than the amazing Thai shrimp and coconut soup, the one dish that's always on the menu. I would not recommend ordering their foie gras, if it's on the menu. It was the only dish that really missed the mark. I've only had foie gras one other time before, at Picasso in Vegas, so I don't have that much of a basis of comparison, but the foie gras at Mosaic was way inferior to Picasso's phenomenal foie gras (my understanding is that the best foie gras should be firm, smooth, a little buttery - there's here was watery and blubbery). However, that was the only \""miss\"" of the night, out of our many courses. For a special occasion or a splurge night out, you won't be disappointed by Mosaic's beautiful restaurant and surroundings, excellent staff, and wonderful food."
0,"I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy! I didn't complain or write a negative review when I saw 2 of the employees smoking marijuana near the gas pumps or when they sucked up my cup holder mat in that past but this last time was just too much. First off..the \""upsell' at these places is more annoying than any car lot I've ever been too in the past. If you only want a wash, stand-by. The pests, aka employees, will make you feel like trash when you repeatedly deny the stupid add ons they seem to think are mandatory for every car. Just read the other reviews, so many horrible opinions of this place can't be wrong.\n\nAfter dodging the \""wash advisor\"" for several minutes they take my car. When I get it back it's almost worse than when I brought it in. I guess I did just order the $20 VIP wash (w/ hand wash which was an extra $5) and not the super duper ultimate blowout experience they offered for $150, but c'mon..learn how to do the one thing you're there to do..wash a car. After driving 10 feet in the parking lot I stopped, and fortunate for me stepped out and checked the \""work\"" these guys did, I notice this extremely poor job and complained. This created a huge scene of pointing fingers at one another and failing to take the blame. The wheels were filthy and hadn't even been cleaned or treated. That's when I notice my custom valve caps on my wheel missing (value = $20). This in turn caused another complaint which brought an individual someone referred to as \""the manager\"" over to me. This guy stood next to wheel for about 10 seconds, says \""oh yeah I see what you mean\"" followed by \""we're not doing anything about this, my guys don't unscrew and steal these things.\"" Absolute worst customer service and way to handle something like this I have ever experienced. Also, after dealing with the so called manager I noticed a spider web which had stuck to the side of my car prior to the wash was still there. How does a full service car wash, that charged me $25, completely MISS a white spider web on the outside of an all black vehicle?? Good work guys. \n\nMake a long story short..if you hate your car, love HORRIBLE customer service, high prices, annoying employees that try to sell you things you don't need, and don't mind missing some things that were in/on your car when you initially pulled in than this is the place for you. If not...AVOID!!!"
0,"Went all the way out to the Casino with our friends for the steak special at Club 87 that we all  have ordered  for several years. Was told by our waiter that they now have discontinued the steak special for $10.99, and included a glass of wine or beer.   Ordered another dinner, and when our friend wanted a baked potato instead of the mashed potatoes, we were told it would cost more.  I managed in food service and owned a restaurant previously, and quite frankly, I have never heard of such a thing.  Very disappointed that they discontinued the steak special, so I guess we will not be going to Fort McDowell for dinner anymore.  It was always one of our favorite spots.  Good Bye Fort McDowell!"
1,"I absolutely love coming to the Wranglers games! \n\nGoing to see the Wranglers play hockey, makes me feel like I'm a kid again. I am not a big sports watching enthusiast, but I can watch the Wranglers play hockey each and every day. My family and I go crazy over their hockey games!\n\nI love how they(Wranglers announcers) get the audience so involved with things like: Being horrible dancers, whipping your hair back and fourth, and booing the other team in sync. Its brilliant! When you can openly yell, mock other players, and make fun of referees while eating nachos, drinking beer, and hanging out with your family, you are in a combination of happy success. My family will be representing the Wranglers for a long time, and can ever hardly wait until the next game!\n\nThanks Wranglers for being amazing!"

0,"I first arrived in Vegas too early to check into Circus Circus, so I stayed at the local Red Roof Inn for a few hours to get some sleep. \n\nI wish I would have just stayed at the Red Roof Inn the entire time, because it was so much nicer than this massively gross hotel. \n\nThe only positive about this place is the massive free parking garages that they have. That's it. \n\nBetween the air conditioning in the rooms that hardly worked, the disgusting elevators, the difficult staff, the annoyingly pushy housekeeping people, the overpriced food/alcohol/EVERYTHING that they have in their building, it makes for an unpleasant experience. \n\nCircus Circus is probably the cheapest large hotel out of all the big ones in Vegas - But do yourself a favor, whether you're coming with kids, or a significant other, save your money, stay at the nicely remodeled Red Roof Inn down the street where you'll save a ton of money that you can then spend on doing fun stuff in Vegas. Sinking your money into this damn Circus place is just a waste."
0,"After seeing the earlier reviews, we ordered from China Joy this evening.  I was hoping to find something similar to Golden Phoenix in NLV, as we really liked them but moved to the south side last fall. I'm thinking that we either ordered at the wrong time of day/night, or everyone else who reviewed them is insane...\nThe potstickers were drier than my backyard in August, and not helped by the bland dipping sauce.\nThe orange chicken was flavorless, not even remotely spicy, and we found a neck bone in it, of all things!\nThe sesame chicken tasted \""weird\"", per my preteen son... Not sure what that means, but it's not favorable.\nThe sweet & sour chicken was passable, though the sauce was quite thin.  Didn't really matter to a three yr old, so it was fine.\nThe curry chicken was interesting, and not too bad.  Since I have been looking for a good curry place, as well, I think I'll probably order it again to make sure.\n\nOverall, not a great dinner.\nAs my husband says, I guess we'll be ordering from the place that takes forever to deliver, because at least we know the food's okay.\n*sigh*"
1,"Very touristy, but, hey, we were tourists there!  A great place to hop on a bus tour, and get some tartan items.  Go early, though, because it gets very crowded in the afternoons."

0,"This is a review for their high tea.\n\nThe flavors are there but the execution needs major work.\n\nSandwiches: very dry. When I poked them with my finger, u could hear the crunch. The apple/cheese was the best in flavor. The cucumber, which I expect to be light, was way too salty.\n\nScones: Our cranberry scones were good. My plain scone was overbaked. \n\nDessert: everything was meh. The macaron was so hard I could barely bite into it.\n\nTea: the tea was nothing to rave about. 12 standard tea flavors.\n\nAmbiance: we were really hoping to have a nice lunch out on the patio with our puppy. But the misters are broken (the rest of the mall had their misters on and we enjoyed that), there are no fans. So it was way too hot to enjoy our hot tea.\n\nOverall not my favorite.  If your menu emphasis \""made fresh daily\"", everything should taste fresh."
0,"While I'm starting low because my experience hasn't been that great, I'm still willing to come back and try it again. \n\nWalking in the decor is modern hip diner with wood flooring, dark cabinetry, paper fixtures, and an appeasing green/orange/brown color scheme. I didn't have to wait as I went straight to the bar to sit. The noise level is a little loud with techno type music playing. This is a little random but the silverware was bulky and hard to use. \n\nI ordered 1 scrambled egg. Side of hash browns. Soyrizo. Tortilla. Coffee. The total was $11.37. The egg was cooked well and the hash browns was a healthy portion. However, both were very bland. I didn't even eat the soyrizo as the spices gave it a horrible taste, so I didn't touch it past the first bite. I'm spoiled by the Trader Joes soyrizo I think. The coffee was also bland, but I drank it because I needed my caffeine. I was never offered a refill or top off. The bartender was prompt enough but no personality. Never asked how everything was etc. \n\nI've heard so many good things about this place, so I was disappointed. Next time I will try those pancakes everyone talks about, and partake of the bar menu."
0,"I received a ton of gift cards to tgifridays... unfortunately, this is the location closest to me. The food @ this one has been mediocre and frequently incorrect. Even wrote in to their corporate office once and received a voucher for $8- pretty sad state if I don't even want to use it.\n\nOther locations have not inspired this feeling in me. Its like this one just doesn't care."
1,"The Samba cracks me up. I love this place ......\n\nWho thinks that walking into a steakhouse between two large bananas........ located just off the casino floor .......\nis going to provide a gourmet brazilian experience????\nIt is the typical Vegas \""over the top\""  - \""over blown\"" dining experience.\n\nComparing the Samba to a traditional Churrascaria experience -\nis like comparing \""Phantom of the Opera\"" on Broadway to the Vegas production. \nThe Vegas production is great - but it is a \""VEGAS production.\"" \nThe Samba is fun but it is not really Churrascaria either ........\nit is the Vegasized version ......\n\nI love meat \nand this place provides you all the meat you can handle.\n\nThe side dishes are \""interesting\"" - but they should not take you away from the real reason you are here - the meat.\n\nI have been here four times and I am still not sure what to do with the creamed spinach  on the side ....\nThe drink selections are supurb ..... second only to the meat ! !\n\nI love the waiters - they are gracious and accommodating ...\n \nMy son dined with me and not quite being twenty one orders a margarita. The waiter asks to see ID........ \nAndrew says \""sure\"" and immediately pulls out his drivers license clearly stating he is not twenty one........\nWaiter says thanks and brings him the drink ..... \nI love these guys\n\nThe price seems right for an evening of dining enjoyment.\nThe one thing that does surprise me is how you seem to be removed from the casino atmosphere when you are dining ....... even though the gaming is taking place only a short distance away.\n\nThe bananas at the door should give you a clue\nTake the Samba for what it is - a \""vegas production\"" and enjoy.\nYou will have a great time."
1,"This was our second stop on the Urban Wine Walk this past weekend. After the 'not very good' service we received at 1130 (two doors down), we decided to sit at the bar. There were quite a few people enjoying their wine and little pizza sliver snacks and the wait staff was very attentive (and absolutely adorable!) They ran out of the snacks so I had to wait a while for them to cook up another batch, but had a pleasant time watching the game and chatting with my friends. The atmosphere is cozy, I like the way they updated the old UNO shop and the full bar. I will definitely go back to try something off the menu."
0,"If you come here for a pre-employment hair drug test, DO NOT trust Michelle Garcia cutting your hair. I went in for the drug test & was unfortunate to get this MONSTER. I have long black hair. This witch cut off a huge chunk of hair from the top/crown part of my head, that started from the right to the left then went down to the back of my head. It wasn't even a clean cut. She swore she was making sure you wouldn't be able to see, but she's obviously a liar. Before cutting my hair she kept telling me how beautiful my hair was. I was so upset & I made sure she knew it. Her response was, \""I'm sorry honey.\"" Bitch are you serious?? I quickly shut her up. Don't tell me you're sorry when you intended to do this.  She didn't even bother cutting my hair from 3 different spots, instead she cut a ridiculously chunk of hair from 1 spot!"
1,"I really enjoyed the wi-fi service while waiting for my oil change. The prices are average rates. Expect good customer service. Unless you make an appointment your estimated wait time may be an hour like mine was. But when you need an oil change and have some time to spare, why not?"
1,"I came here visiting from Colorado. It was a wonderful experience. Polite staff, quick service, great breakfast food. Menu was extensive, and large portions for the price. Everything I would want for a breakfast place, smaller but plenty of room. Well worth the wait. I would definitely return here. Wish the owner was still in Colorado now!"
0,they make smaller tables wait longer to be sat and the food is not that great you can get better food at mid level steakhouse
1,"At the gallery, I heard a friend talking about the fact she was going to be singing with a band that night.  She said people I knew were all gathering there to her her sing.  I asked if I could going them so she gave me the name and address of the bar.  I really enjoy these people but the idea of going to a bar?  Not my way I want to spend a relaxing evening with friends.  However, I had asked if I could join them so thought I'd better go.  This is a case of where I should have read what reviews I could find on Yelp because Karen L's review really gets it right.\n\n\nIt's kind of a bar, lounge, restaurant all combined in one.  The atmosphere is as welcoming to a stranger than any place I have been for a long time. There is a real cultural mix which I found to be very inviting.  It's not a tony place. It's neighbourhood and happily open to anyone who might walk in the door.  I sat at a long table with friends including their two ten year olds.  Kind of fun for all.\n\nThe food...I didn't know they served food but they have a menu that  I am sure most could find something to order from.  I tried the rib tips which a certain female friend recommended.  I rarely eat beef and BBQ so can't say I have much to compare with what I ate.  It had a distinct flavor and the meet was tender.  I couldn't complain.  I saw a person having a burger and fries that really looked good but as I said based on the recommendation from that particular individual...\n\n\nThe music was a mix by a small group from the 40's up.  It was a little loud but for a room full of friends having a good time, that was fine.  I enjoyed hearing them and listening to my friend sing.  From what I could see, a good time was had by all.  As I said before, don't do for the style, go for the fun.  I'm not sure when the band played so if you go there for that, call ahead."
1,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet:  I feel like I always want to eat here every time I'm in Vegas!!!  \n\nWhat I love about this place:\n- French onion soup is delicious! \n- Outdoor seating offers a perfect view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountain show\n- Service was attentive and prompt\n\nThere's always a ton of people here, so make sure you make reservations - if not, expect to wait about 45 min - 1 hour."
1,"One aspect I really enjoy about restaurants is when they are immaculately clean. Everything was spotless and organized. There are plenty of seats outside the patio if the weather is nice, & inside it's very spacious, with trendy tables, a nice wall backdrop with running water, & several televisions. Service is alright. Nothing going beyond the means of customer service & nothing that's bad either.\n\nIf you are anyone who is a raw foodie, don't expect this place to state it uses USDA Organic certified items just because it's named 'Greens and Proteins' (that's a question I'm going to ask the next time I'm in!) The menu is definitely a little more healthier than your fast-food alternatives, with wraps, pizza, sandwiches, salads, smoothies, juices, the works. The pricing was what got me, since I could get a green smoothie at Whole Foods for about .50 cents less than here (one that is a lot less sweeter). \n\nI purchased the vegetable wrap & the green smoothie, all of which came out to $20 (definitely not cheap, as most health-alternative restaurants aren't). I was pleasantly surprised how delicious the green smoothie turned out! While $7.50 is a little much, at the same time it was in a cup that was generous in size for its price. It was very sweet (from the agave nectar & stevia), nothing like the green smoothies from Whole Foods which are a little more on the less sweeter end. I was even more impressed by the vegetable wrap, for it was a filling size (had to take the other portion to-go) & it came with these tofu-like fries with seasoning & a dip sauce on the side that was amazing! \n\nWalking in, I was a little questionable about this place, even more so by the price, but after tasting it for myself, it's actually quite good here. I debated giving it three stars, but I was reminded by my green smoothie it's definitely a place I'd like to return to when I'm in the neighborhood craving a healthy alternative to other restaurants surrounding them!"
0,"Not sure if we went on a bad night or what, but I have to say this place was a pretty big disappointment.  I went in with a small group of friends.  Below is a summary of what we ordered and a brief description of the dish/entree\n\nSteaks Chops:\nNew York Steak prepared with the peppers and chilis- (Salty)\nBone in New York Steak prepared salt and pepper - (Salty)\nBone in Rib Eye prepared Chimichurri - (Salty)\nLamb Chops - (bitter, weird sauce with the chop, not appetizing)\n\nSides:\nMac and Cheese - (Tasty, cheesy, and buttery, can't go wrong with this)\nBone Marrow - (Very generous portion of marrow, delicious)\nBrocollini - (2nd saltiest side there was)\nSauteed mushrooms - (saltiest thing of the night)\nTater Tots - (Pretty good!)\n\nDeserts:\nCreme Brulee with Blueberry - (Mediocre at best)\nI forgot the name, but it's a Cronut with caramel ice cream and caramelized bananas - (Really great flavor, probably best dish of the night which is not saying much)  \n\nService:\nService was terrible, considering this was a $500 meal.. you would think we would receive at least some decent service.. but no.. we had to waive down our waiter several times for drinks and service.  We were given desert without utensils.  Not once did our server approach us to see how we were doing.  We still tipped because we aren't barbarians.. but something needs to be done about this.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want something salty.. save yourself some money and buy a salt lick.  If you want to waste your money on an overrated steak joint.. then you've found the right place."
1,"Missing a star due to service being a little off (seriously, who runs out of ketchup?), but everything was delicious and excessive.  :)"
1,"I love that this place is close to home and is located in the Arroyo Crossing Plaza, so I can get various shopping time all at the same area.\n\nHowever, this place is a hit and miss. I have had very poor service from the workers there and I have had very great customer service. I guess it truly depends on who is working on what day and what time you go. The workers (when I experienced poor service) was due to their 'I don't care\"" attitude and when you asked for help about a product, they didn't seem very willing to help out. I have had very great service as well, where the lady helped me and even answered more than I had in mind. \n\nUlta always has sales and a lot of times you can score something rather cheap and affordable. If you have no subscribed to them, you definitely should. They have various coupons from 20%, $3.50 off $10 purchase, and sometimes $5 off $10 purchase. I never go without the coupons  Who doesn't want to at least save a few dollars here and there. \n\nAnd every so often, depending on how much you spend, there are different reward levels and you can choose a gift after that certain time period is over.\n\nThey also added the Clinique line to the Ulta store which is even better! Though the store is a little clumped together due to various products they have. \n\nI always come out from Ulta purchasing something and will definitely come back here."
1,"Alston is a talented professional in every sense of the word. I recently had the pleasure of working with him on a charity event for our local Museum of Art where he helped to source, dress and create the looks for the entertainment of the evening, twenty five in total. His creativity & level of excitement was infectious and the quality of his work was far beyond our expectations. I would highly recommend him to anyone, I can whole-heartedly say that they won't be disappointed."
1,"My guy friends decided to hang out at this place during a Saturday night, my only night in town.  We came around 11ish PM.  There wasn't really a line, although there were a lot of people inside.  There wasn't a cover for guys/girls.  The music was alright.  Sounded like a mixture of everything along with top 40s.  We found a free table in back and hung out there the whole night.  I drank 2 AMFs and didn't feel much of a buzz...or maybe I did later but didn't realize it lol\n\nIt was a good night.  We even had some entertainment going on with some drunk people trying to jump the rail by our table.  I guess the lady was too drunk to realize that she can get in if she could just act normally.  Too bad security came by and made them leave.  For the rest of the night, the guys were trying to pick up on some girls, but I guess they see me and think I'm cock-blocking or something.  Some girls actually had made eye contact with them but they didn't do anything -_-  No game hahaha"
1,I've been going here for the past year for oil & fluid changes. DJ always makes you feel welcome & knows how to treat their customers. They always have great deals! I have not had any problems with them at all.
0,"Our room was comped, so we decided to stay here for 2 nights. Overall, we didn't spend much time in the room. So, for our purposes the room was fine, but I still would never stay here again...even if it is free. \n\nParking: Sucks. We arrived late at night and valet was full. Valet guy told us to park in the lot or to try Harrahs parking. We looked for an hour (literally an hour) and found nothing. We go back to valet guy and he says \""oh, you should try the overflow lot\"". Overflow lot?! Why didn't you tell us that to begin with! We ended up parking there and it was pretty far from the hotel entrance, but at least we got parking.\n\n\nCheck in: Terrible. We waited about 1.5 hours just to check in. \n\nRooms: Sketchy. Our room didn't smell like smoke and we didn't find roaches (like other reviewers), but there were plenty of carpet and wall stains. The bed sheets were clean and pretty comfortable. Room was outdated as expected, and you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on in the room next to you. You probably don't want to hear those things in Vegas."
0,"We were members of fill-a-seat for the past two years, but this year I did not renew our membership to the Phoenix area.  Reason?  We love the Phoenix Symphony venues and attended every one we could, but it became apparent that we were being 'moved up' as the season continued--and by 'up' I mean from beginning seats on the floor and first balcony, then higher to the second balcony and finally all the way up to the 'nosebleed' seats, even at performances that were not especially well attended and where many vacant rows with better seats were available.  The last 6 months have been the worst...the fill-a-seat attendees have definitely been singled out for 'grouping' in the worst seats and are 'guarded' by symphony volunteers.  Unfortunately as well, many fill-a-seat attendees are loud and uncouth at the symphony, using cell phones throughout the performance and generally behaving as if they've never been in a symphony hall....which probably is the reason we were relegated to the upper section to begin with! At any rate, we won't be renewing...I'd rather buy 'real' tickets 'and sit where I can hear the music and see the stage. And one more thing--the Symphony is usually the only venue worth attending when you don't care for rage-in-the-cage or bar comedy shows..."
0,"If I could give 0 stars I would! Horrible employees, horrible customer service, and horrible management. Back in may I had purchased balloons for my graduation party. After we picked them up and took them out of the plastic bag we realized they were table height when we asked for floor length. By the time the party started some of the balloons had deleted and we paid extra for high float. \nLater we called the store and explained our situation and were told we would get a credit! I went in to pick up my credit and was told by management that there was a list of credits in the back and not to worry. \nToday I went to use that credit and no one  knew anything about it. Later I got on the phone with Kevin the rude manager who assured me that my situation wouldn't have happened and that there is no list so he basically insinuated that I was lying. \nI failed to mention that the day I went to order my balloons the lady behind the counter was less than helpful and made faces when we asked different styles of center balloons. Clearly she hates her job and life. Not one smile the whole time she helped us. This store is a waste of time and so are the people stay away!!!!"
1,"Mother India is something different. Although at the time I didnt realsise there was a Mother India in Glasgow, when I was here recently, I knew I had found something a bit special.\n\n\nSet aside in a tiny fronted building, inside Mother India spans two floors and is a lovely mixture or traditional and more modern concepts when it comes to the decor. It's actually rather pleasing on the eye, and if I were able to bring a few scatter cushions and a bean bag, I would have a perfect chill out space. Anyway...\n\nThe food here is something different - its kind of like the bastard love child of Spain and India - a selection of tiny portions designed to be eaten Tapas style, but from a very indian menu. The concept actually work very well - the food is not only excellent, but by ordering lots of dishes everybody gets a taste of what they fancy without suffering from food envy.\n\nThere is, depending on what combination of food you order, a overpowering sense of flavour which may be unpleasent to some peoples tastes, however, anything that manages to put a modern spin on Indian food is good with me. It also helps that I love tapas. So, \""Yay! I'm a fan.\"""
1,Why was my first time at the old town Tavern it was on Easter Sunday the place was packed but this girl Barb kicked ass and did a great job I would highly recommend this place
0,"For those wondering, the restaurant.com coupons work fine, however the incompetent staff at Il Posto couldn't and/or wouldn't figure out 18% for the included gratuity.\n\nThe coupon clearly states that it would be included, so no surprise there.....\n...but a big WTF when I realized looking at the receipt that they had either purposefully or accidentally calculated exactly 20% as the autogratuity.\n\nNow by saying it may have been an accident, I'm really pushing things and trying to be nice because I overall liked the place.\n\nI cannot honestly come up with an explanation as to how a person who'd graduated 4th grade math could read a peice of paper saying 18% and then calculate 20%, unless is was blatantly done on purpose with the idea that the customer wasn't going to figure it out.\n\nSHAME SHAME SHAME\n\nThe decor here is a mish-mash of old and new, good and bad, nice and ugly.  They've recently done (some) remodeling, since I saw a huge dumpster in the parking lot, but they aren't finished inside.  There are huge areas where exposed surfaces are in need of paint or drywall, and a huge sheet of plastic hung in a doorway behind us, swooshing with every breeze of a server walking by.\nThe outside patio area did indeed look very neato, like a street in italy or new york.  Inside, they have a dining area with warm wood accents, a lit-up fountain, and dim lighting (which i liked, but the mrs said was making her feel woozy) right next to the kitchen area's flourescent light fixtures and flourescent lime green paint.  What classiness the first area had was lost with barely a shift of your glance, since there's no wall or anything separating the two areas.\nThe very uncomfortable booths have hard wood back and a butt cushion that's token at best, with the bottom of the seat being way too long, so your back can't reach the seatback so you are forced to chose between sitting upright with no backrest at all, or slouching so badly that a painful arch is in your middle back.\n\nThe food had good and bad, as well.  The bread basket with pesto dip was superb, and like many others have said, we should've simply eaten that until full and then left.  \n\nThe lady's ceviche was a huge portion, and said to be very good (didn't eat it), but the tortillas I did sample were overcooked, looking only slightly dark but tasting burnt.\n\nMy NY strip pizziaola - after being ordered as \""tell the chef to aim for between Medium and Medium Rare\"" - arrived at barely even MR, but was tasty enough with all that garlicy marinara (*SLICES* of shaved garlic, like in Goodfellas!) that the extra juiciness was okay with me.  I used more of the appetizer bread to soak up the bloodiness.  Mmmmm aus juis\n\nThe other had a penne dish with chicken and mushrooms in a brown sauce.  This was said to be all just fine, but my keen eye saw the chicken going untouched and a few peices of penne being pushed around.  Probing proved that all was not just fine, since the chicken was quite dry, and the penne was so barely grasping to reach al dente doneness that she thought at first it might be whole wheat pasta (the dim lighting may have contributed also).\n\nService was 'eh'.  Yes, that's right.  It was so generic, by-the-book, make sure we cover all the requisite phrases and checking in moments -- but nothing more than that -- that I cannot even warrant the \""M\"" to give them the entire 'meh'.  \n\nWhen inquiring if we'd like wine, and asked for Spumante, the server replied, \""you mean Spumoni?!? We don't have that.\""\nWe looked at each other.....I so badly wanted to ask \""so, you don't have the wine, or you don't have the ice cream?\""....but we both just gave a tentative \""okaaaaaaay...\""    Chose not to try getting any wine.   8^ |\n\nThere was nothing too horrible about the service, but nothing great either......\n\nEXCEPT of course there was the fact that someone involved in making up the bill decided to _*help themselves*_ to a 20% gratuity when the coupon states that an 18% gratuity is included.\n\nEven with the mediocre service, I would have added a personal table tip to the auto-gratuity, but I certainly did not do that once I saw the 20% on the bill.\nI also chose not to bring it up with the server, because it was obvious that they already knew that it was calculated at 20%, and I wasn't about to play the whole Pretend It Was An Error game.\nThere was no mis-reading the coupon.\nThere was no mistake in the math.\nIt was *calculated* at exactly 20% with intention.\nSo that's what they got from me.  Nothing else.\n\n...except this review."
1,"I have been here several times now. A very healthy place to come to eat. The food is wonderful and very fresh. Nice and modern decor as well.\nThe only down side is it is very expensive i think. But it is in the Biltmore so that ups the price.\nYou can have your car valeted, or park in yourself in the nice cool parking Garage in the back. I opted for that.  It was started by Dr. Andrew Weil and the first time i went there with my friend Kris, he was sitting right next to us at a table.  It is a very nice place to go when you want to have a lovely relaxing lunch and really enjoy yourself."
0,"I've gone here about twice only because I really wanted to some grits and a biscuit.  Neither were that great.  The grits:  overly salted, lumpy, and too runny.  The biscuit: decent enough as far as biscuits go.  Didn't disappoint but didn't delight me either.  The potatoes:  way too salty for my taste.  \n\nMaybe I'm sensitive to salt, but you guys really need to monitor that. I know it's breakfast food but at least be mindful of the sodium. I had no problems with the service on each of my visit, but I'm unlikely to return again."
0,"Don't believe the hype! I won't say this place is awful, but it's nothing to write home about.\n\nI heard about BFG over a year ago, and I kind of forgot about it. It resurfaced in my mind a few days ago, and I just had to try it. \n\nMaybe I expected too much? I ordered the baked chicken. with the mac and cheese. Don't expect to just walk in and get your food in a minute or two. You'll be waiting a few, especially if they are busy. It's completely worth it though..  the food was still steaming by the time I got to my house in the Aliante area. I was impressed.\n\nMy order consisted of baked chicken with honey mustard and BFG sauce, and the mac and cheese. The chicken was fine. Nothing that I couldn't prepare myself. The mac and cheese was completely disappointing! It looks so good from the pictures I've seen, but it was complete bland. A soupy mac and cheese covered in cheese. Boring! The best thing on my plate was the honey mustard sauce. That's kinda sad....\n\nThe service is awesome. The staff is really friendly! I think I paid just under $7 bucks, which really wasn't bad. I just wish the good was better."
0,"That was GROSS. Some of the worst sushi and worst service I have ever received in my life. I LOVE sushi and am very disappointed not only in the service and food but also in the way the manager handled the situation (or FAILED to handle). I have been a server, manager and NEVER complain. But I cannot believe how awful this was. I'm praying I don't get food poisoning."
0,"Called the night before I planned on going in, and asked if they accepted my insurance.  The receptionist informed me that yes they do.  Went in at 8:15 and asked once again if they were in my insurance; this time the receptionist said that 'we accept all insurances but just check to make sure you're in network.'  She also wanted to give me an additional form for my insurance carrier.  As soon as I heard her say this I knew they were not in network and would get taken to the cleaners if I stayed to get treated.  My insurance is extremely common and they are providing a very political answer to trick patients into getting treated with them.  Unprofessional and deceptive. By the time I checked on my smart phone for someone in network and got there, I had missed my early window for low wait time and had to wait quite a bit.  Waste of time this place."
1,"Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure."
0,"Too much noise from the hallway. At ALL hours of the night. Trust me. This place has potential with decor, location, pricing,(minus resort fees) and comfort. But the noise was unacceptable. We were woken up with everyone strolling in at all hours of the night and morning shouting epic things like: \"" WWWOOOHOOO VEGAASSS BABY\"" !!\""\nThat's cute, the first 4 or 5 times, but seriously at 4 or 5 am, it starts to get old.\n\nResort fees for anyone that is interested, is what makes your deal on priceline/internet go south. \nVegas adds resort fees. Which they say is for \n'using the resort and getting the paper\""etc. \nWe never got a paper, or used the \""gym\"" and had to pay. \nMandatory fee.\n But seriously if I am getting charged $25 a day extra I better get a paper at my door or something. I never did. \nSo, to me, the resort fee is a scam that you have to factor in while reserving a place in Vegas. This is apparently the \""norm\"" in Vegas so be aware as your planning. I am sad, I didn't even get a deal on the new dolphin show.\n\nIf your gaming in their casino, well expect rude insensitive a-holes to neglect you. It was like a desert when it came to getting a drink while gambling. I spent quite a bit and nearly died of thirst.\nWhen I did get a drink,  I sat at the bar and they pre-fix the pouring spout to a 2 count (vs 4 count) and say they \""can't control it\"" on the comped drinks.\n\nThe best deal was the giant cocktail for $20 we got before the LOVE show, in the love amphitheater . It was strong, good, and huge! The Love show was awesome. It made up for so much disappointment in the resort.\n\nThe bottom line in pricing: We paid for 2 nights ( Wed and Thurs.) and the 9:00 show with good seats, according to the web sites 'Love package\"" $358. According to their rep, that fee included taxes. Final bill in reality, was actually $448, with resort fees and other taxes that they \""apparently did not include\"". Well, that is what the manager said when i questioned the price difference."
0,"I love Paradise Bakery and eat there often, it has been hard having some locations close and change names. My friend and I met at Paradise Bakery and were shocked at how rude an employee Jenna was to the other staff working. When you are rude to other people it reflects bad on you. Jenna, you need to take a BE NICE class."
0,The customer service is lacking.  Did not go above and beyond in anyway.  They did not call to touch base with us as they stated they would.  The finished product is acceptable except the headlights.  They replaced one (damaged during accident) but didn't call and ask us if we wanted to replace the other for an additional charge.  It would have been nice to have been offered the opportunity and it would have been an upsell for them.  They just do not take the time to communicate during the process.
1,"I like the simplicity of this place, the choice of seating and the range of good food. It's an all day sort of offer so full breakfast, big lunch, or just a quick pit stop they have it all.\n\nThay have a wee retail and takeaway section with some essentials so it works asa  kind of gift shop too. Free WiFi."
0,"One of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. Pizza was awful and the service was worse. My favorite part was a manager witnessing our disaster of an over hour long lunch from the table next to us and doing nothing. Avoid this place, there are way too many great pizza places in Scottsdale to suffer through a meal here."
1,"Stopped by here late night to get take out. I was starving but wanted to get straight to bed. Ordered the burger medium and it was fantastic. Thick patty, garlic aioli, and melted cheese (not sure what kind). And, the fries were perfect. Once the staff realized we had just gotten married (hence the wedding dress) they tossed in free dessert. The oatmeal cookies were some of the best I've ever had. Not a cheap late night eat, but well worth it!"
1,Just wanted to say that we had breakfast one morning (Dennys next to our hotel) a few weeks ago when in Scottsdale.  We had been eating at different places in Scottsdale since it was the first time in the city.   After trying another breakfast Restaurant down the street the day before we wanted to eat somewhere we knew.  The service was great they were friendly and helpful.  The food was great.  We both had the country fried steaks and that was the first time all week I eat everything on my place.  The coffee was good.  By the time I left  there I had a smile on my face.  Thanks Denny's staff you are awesome.  Thanks for making my day.....
0,"Umm, I thought a spa in Vegas would be the best, especially at the Venetian... but I was sadly mistaken. The facility was not all that, very small and not very quiet in the \""quiet room\"". Robes were not plush and the pockets were sewn shut (what's up with that???) And the slippers hurt my feet. Burke Williams totally kicks Canyon Ranch's butt! Massage was ok but pretty pricey at $150 for their most basic massage. All in all, I would have rather gambled the $150 while sitting at a slot machine to get my \""quiet\"" time."
0,What a money pit! Food was terrible and not labeled!
1,I love this place! It's walking distance from my office that service delicious fast food.\n\nIt's a great place to grab a quick freshly made breakfast burrito or sandwich.\n\nThe lunch is very good too! They have a daily special that includes a side and a drink and they have good homemade type sandwiches. My personal favorites are the Korean BBQ Sandwich and they make an awesome tuna salad sandwich!\n\nTell them I sent ya!
1,"I really wish I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars. My wife and I travel an hour and a half a few times every year just to eat here. It is definitely geared towards food savvy customers. With food coming on half sheet trays, and kitchen towels for napkins it makes restaurant employees from anywhere feel right at home. The servers and bar staff all seem to enjoy their jobs and take pride in everything they bring to the table.\n     First was the alcohol- They have an excellent list of spirits including many prohibition cocktails, which in my experience have all been delicious. I'm a bourbon drinker, and anytime I find buffalo trace on a menu it's a sign of good things to come. Their barrel aged manhattan was sweet and smooth, and had exactly the right amount of bitters and an imported cherry to boot.\n     Getting appetizers is far and away my favorite part about coming here. The chicken livers are out of this world, and I always get an order of bone marrow.\nI've never had anything here that was anything short of fantastic, but if I were to make a recommendation for an entree I would totally suggest getting into what ever offal parts they have on the menu, or any form braised meat ( shank or short rib).\n    Always remember to save room for dessert. I am not normally a fan of dessert or sweet things in general, but I always save room for that last course here. On our most recent visit I tried tiramisu which was one of the best I've ever had, but the toffee cake was to die for. It was served warm with a side of house-made whipped cream and pomegranate seeds, and I would have ordered a second one had I not been full to the point of bursting.\nAll around great place, with refined drinks, fantastic appetizers, delicious meals, amazing desserts, and the most comfy chairs you could ask for.\n10/10\nJoe Macklin\nPS. To all the jag-offs out there who are complaining about things like being told you cant have more people than you made your reservation for, please stop going to restaurants all you do is cause headaches, and no one wants your business. Also to those who hated everything they tried, it is not the fault of the restaurant if you have poor taste."
0,"This place is very hit or miss. If you come when it's not crowded, you can get good food and good service. If the place is slightly busy, or you are very early or late, they are very unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor to serve you food. I showed up late a couple times and wished they had just told me I was too late to eat. \n\nThe food is pretty bland and nothing that you couldn't make at home. A pancake with a snickers bar laid in the middle sounds awesome, but they do nothing else special with it. \n\nThe chicken is best but make sure you get it fresh and hot or else it's a bit soggy and sad. \n\nAlso, they tend to be very conservative to the point of mocking people on welfare.... So if morals guide you, let them guide you away from this place..."
1,"aaahhhhh the holy grail of makeup stores.  if you're like me, a total MAC fiend, this is the store for you.  inside the Caesars Palace Forum Shops, they carry pretty much all Pro products as well as non-Pro.  the cherry on top?  you don't need a Pro card to purchase!!!  the mua's have always been helpful and sweet.  want to try a product?  no problem!  a mua will already have a brush out, ready to apply as many colors as you like.  loved ones already know i HAVE TO stop in while visiting Sin City and walk away with a bag full of products.  \n\nsome have gambling problems, i have a MAC problem.  no bueno for the bank account!"
0,"If I could give less than one star I would. Went in to Danny's at Tempe Marketplace yesterday for an oil change. I decided to upgrade the car wash to \""The Works\"" for an extra $3. When I got my car back I opened the drivers side door to immediately notice the carpets. They did a terrible job vacuuming. I would honestly be surprised if they told me they vacuumed for more than two minutes. I bring it to a car wash expecting it to be returned to me in a cleaner state than I dropped it off. They slacked on the quality of service I would expect from this place.  Not only were my carpets dirty, but my window and roof of my car had TWO bird poops stains that were still there. I find that unacceptable. There is no excuse except laziness. I even upgraded the car wash to make sure those would be taken care of. I then notice that the interior of my car still had dust and scruff marks on the doors. Those could easily be taken care of with a rag. This was not the first time I have been disappointed with Danny's but I guarantee you it will be my last. I highly suggest to avoid this place at all costs. I have even wrote to Danny's to let them know my feedback privately and I have yet to hear from them. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere. Wherever you go will be sure to do a better job than this place."
0,"I'm glad I'm not the only one that has observed sub-standard flair from this location, management is piss poor and doesn't get it, now they won't get my business. \n\nI ate there in December with family and the experience was that of a very \""OFF\"" operation, nobody to sit you, the front was totally bare, 2 members of the wait staff walked around and served their customers while my party and several others just waited around, a manager that was no where to be found who should have been observing what was going on but was in the back room probably surfing the internet. \n\nFood was overcooked, 3 orders of Eggs Benedict may have well been hard boiled and the sauce had turned, the one order they got right or got it close to being right was the simplest, eggs scrambled with cheese, whomever came up with the idea that you cook it, drop it on a plate and sprinkle the cheese over it and hope that it melts needs to have their cooking spoons taken away but it was tolerable. \n\nMade a few comments to the manager at that time, she was apologetic, I gave them another chance, they blew it again, Sunday morning, busier restaurant, staff met us at the door, sat us and we waited, and waited and waited, watching the waiter from our section walking around the parking lot was a lot of fun while we waited. Finally a waitress came over and got our drink order, could have shown up with water then taken our drink order but it didn't go that way, a few minutes later and we're still waiting, finally some coffee, water, other drinks and she walks away, HEY WE'RE READY TO ORDER, I know she hears it, I'm boisterous at that point, no difference, we wait some more. \n\nFast forward to the food, everything cooked wrong or entire orders are wrong or in one case it has to go back and before finally throwing in the towel and telling the waitress cancel the re-order, everyone is done but one person who didn't end up eating because for some reason it takes longer to cook a medium rare steak than the well done one they delivered or maybe the eggs were still being scrambled. \n\nI called the manager over, advised her of everything that transpired, pointed out her employee was back in the parking lot walking around, talking on the phone and smoking to which her response was oh he's on break, 3 times in the last 30 minutes... wow I wanna work here you don't have to do anything! \n\nFood = Crap\nService = Crap \n\nThis is not indicative of the chain but this location = CRAP !!! \n\nHope they manage to turn it around or there will be another closed food location in Litchfield Park!"
1,"We were looking for a dog friendly restaurant, and happened upon AZ 88. They are wonderful! They brought out a bowl of water for our puppy, and the staff fawned over her - which we loved! \n\nThey were all very friendly, and service was top notch! \n\nThe food was wonderful as well. I ordered one of their salads, and it was delicious! We enjoyed everything about this place, and will definitely be back!!"
0,"The good: Fire-grilled chicken and steak, queso\n\nThe bad: everything else. The prices are higher than average for the whole \""burrito assembly line\"" theme, and the salsa absolutely sucks, and by sucks I mean it literally made me want to vomit. The tortillas are so thick that the food just seems dry and bland. Overall pretty disappointing..."
1,"We LOVED this place! We had the tandoori chicken, tandoori mixed grill and naan. Everything was so flavorful we wanted to keep eating even though the portions are so big you shouldn't clean your plate. We went at dinner on a Wednesday night, so it was pretty empty, but the service was excellent. Maharani just became one of our favorites in Madison!"
1,"When I think of Asian Island, many things come to mind... Delicious, and I mean everything.  Fresh ingredients that are prepared-to-order.  Great service.  Many menu options.  Forever.  As in, it takes FOREVER to get your food here.  If you are in a pinch and need lunch quickly, call ahead or plan to take your meal to-go.  This kind of deliciousness doesn't happen fast.  Dine in customers (and often customers waiting for takeout orders) are treated to crispy wonton strips and dipping sauce to prevent them from eating one another during the extended wait for food.  But fret not, my friend, for once the goods are placed before you, you can't help but forget the agony you endured waiting for it.  This is top notch fast-casual dining.  Sadly, I have to deduct a star for the slow food service.  If they can get moving in the kitchen and start turning tables over a bit more quickly, they'd have no trouble getting a five star rating out of me."
0,"I have been an avid Starbucks customer for many many years now, and I have traveled to Starbucks locations all across the country on business.\n\nAs this location is close to where I work, I am forced to frequent it often. It has consistently been slow and the customer service is often as ghetto as the neighborhoods which surround it. \n\nThis morning, I waited 20 minutes in line and found out that this is the ONLY Starbucks in the country that won't grind a bag of coffee beans because it is not Starbucks coffee.\n\nWell Starbucks, you've lost one more customer. I won't be visiting this location again."
1,Really good food.  Try the Chili Relleno.  Great patio day or nite.  Parking may be a little tite.
1,"Wow!  Twelve days, FOUR new Super Buffets!  Arlin B. joined me today to whip over to this one for their Grand Opening.  It's a beautiful place, & was featuring about 136 food items, not counting sauces & dressings.  The food was delicious, & I particularly liked the Sushi here...  very tasty!  There's a Mongolian BBQ, the table service was friendly & attentive, all the trays were being kept stocked, & there were no shortcomings at all for me.  In fact, this is my favorite of all four of the brand new ones:  Crazy Buffet in Mesa, Fuji Buffet (remodeled & reopened), Mandarin Super Buffet on Bethany Home, & this one.\n\nWith these four now up & running, one on the way having bombed out (Hibachi Grill on Bell Rd.), two other Hibachis are under construction to replace it, plus another China City, so we still have 3 more new Super Buffets coming to the Valley this year!  Meanwhile, 5 Stars for this one!     :-))"
1,"Petit resto mexicain, coin St-Laurent/Sherbrooke, d\u00e9j\u00e0 3 fois que j'y vais, j'adore leur tortillas au boeuf avec guacamole. Ils ont bien s\u00fbr des tacos, des burritos, de la Corona et XX mais aussi des cocktails (Marquarita, tequila....) Les serveuses sont toujours souriantes et offre un bon service."
0,"We booked through Advantage via Orbitz because of the lower price knowing full well that the agents would be asking us to take the insurance and full tank option.\n\nNow, normally I can deal with the sale-sy agents and their jedi minds tricks like when they ask \""would you like to take the basic coverage or the premium coverage?\""  They don't even give you the option to decline coverage.\n\nBut this time, the agent flat out lied about the gas option.  He told me that we could bring the tank full and have the gas option credited which is total BS, but the way he explained it, I bought it hook, line and sinker.  I should have asked him to put it in writing and to write his name down.  Or I should have recorded the conversation with my phone.  He would have scurried away like the rat he is.\n\nLuckily, I figured out that he was lying before we returned the car and got gas.  I read the contract to double check what he said was true.  It states that no refund given for partial full tank.  With that knowledge and the face that we used over 3/4th of the tank, I decided not to fill the tank.\n\nWhen we got back to the car rental drop off, I asked the guy who inspected the car if he had ever heard of the refund for the gas option.  Obviously he did not.\n\nAfter dropping off the car, I went looking for the agent to tell him in his face that he was a LIAR!!  Lucky for him & the company he wasn't there.\n\nKnow what you need from car rental places before you get to the counter.  Check with YOUR insurance company and know what they will cover on rental cars...typically they have the coverage you need already.  No need to waste the extra $10 a day with the car rental companies.  \n\nReject the full tank gas option if you know you'll have time to gas up...you really have to get down to a low amount of gas to make the full tank option worth it even with the lower price on gas that they offer.  If you know you won't have the 5-10 minutes to gas up, I guess it would be worth it too.\n\nBottom line is that I might rent from Advantage in the future but if they pull something like this again, I'm recording the conversation and sending it to whatever consumer protection department I need to."
0,"I visited the Super Star Car Wash at 1919 S. Greenfield Rd Mesa, AZ 85206 on 12/16/2012. One of the guys convinced me to buy a 1-month membership for \""Express Plus: Protect and Shine\"" package for $11.95 (normally $21.95). I was told this would not renew automatically. The first car wash was a free upgrade to the \""Protect & Shine Plus: Everything Wash\"". My first time through was nice and the car looked great.\n\nI came back on 12/23/2012 after taking my daughter to the mall to get a picture with Santa. I decided to stop by and get a car wash on the way home. We got through the wash cycle and we were being pulled through the rinse cycle. Sometime before we got to the dry cycle my dash lit up showing I was losing tire pressure somewhere (my vehicle has one light for TPMS). At first I thought it was nothing since sometimes the light would kick off if the tires were just a little low. But just to play it safe I pulled my vehicle into a nearby parking lot and checked. I found my front passenger side tire was going flat and I could hear air rushing out of a broken tire stem. Somehow this got damaged by the car wash.\n\nI found and talked to one of the employees and showed him the damage. He took pictures and filed a report which he had me verify and sign. He also helped me a little bit with changing my tire so I could put on a spare. He told me someone would contact me soon after they do their \""investigation\"". \n\nThe next day I took my car to Discount Tire Co and they fixed my tire and replaced the broken TPMS module. This cost me about $80.\n\nOne other thing, the sales guy lied to me about charging me for just a 30-day membership. Turns out they have me on a automatic renewal of $21.95.\n\nIt is now 1/19/2013, almost one month later and I have not heard a single word from Super Star Car Wash. I just submitted an online feedback at their website (I can find no office number for this place) and requested a reimbursement and cancellation of monthly membership I shouldn't have been charged for.\n\nI do not recommend this place."
0,"I was tricked into coming here.  This place serves burgers and pretty much nothing else.  They offer a home-made vegan patty on the menu, but it turns out there are no vegan buns.  The waitress was kind enough to offer to put the patty on top of a couple pieces of lettuce, which is slightly better than what we've experience some other places.  But, if you are serious about trying to cater to us dietary weirdos, please go the extra step and save a spot in your freezer for a couple frozen vegan buns from Whole Foods.  You can them pop in the oven for 8 minutes on the rare occasion a vegan actual tries to partake of your otherwise flavorful offerings."
0,"I think we may have picked the wrong day or the wrong time of day to visit. It was like dining in a school lunchroom. Noisy, table was dirty when we sat down, and food, which was mediocre at best, was slow to come out. On the upside, the staff was very friendly!"
1,"Remember the Seinfeld episode where Jerry takes his car to the mechanic who is fanatical about the car, thinks Jerry ain't doing a good job, and kidnaps the car from Jerry?  Welcome Sean of wood and laminate flooring installs...\n\nTHIS is a guy you want installing your floor.  Some contractors are really owners who do the bids, and the day the real work is starting, you get some young hires at the door (not that they aren't qualified).  Sean is an owner operated biz, and he talks about floors like they are living and breathing organisms... \""acclimating\""... \""resting\""...\n\nHe lets you order the floors thru his wholesaler (went w/ Consumer Reports top rated Armstrong laminate), and since I paid the company direct, I bought at cost which was definitely cheaper than the retail (I shopped retail first, narrowed my choices, so I knew what I wanted by the time I went to the wholesaler's showroom).  He also accommodated my budget conscientiousness (to put it nicely), allowing me to buy my own baseboards and paint before he installed.\n\nBut let's talk about dedication... Sean really wants the floors to be installed right.  When we noticed a flex in the floor b/c of different levels of concrete where the 2 seams meet, I left him in the house in the morning for a quick tear down job and lay in some filler to remove the flex.  Come lunch time swing by the house to drop off my first Costco groceries for the new place, Sean is still there... he took it upon himself to GRIND DOWN the concrete, causing him several hours of addtl work.  He just wanted to floors to not flex and using filler wasn't working.  Later he calls me and chides me about the temp of the house, and how it's drying out my floors... fanatical devtion I tell you... and I mean it in a very complimentary way.  \n\nYou want a contractor who loves what they do and does what they do well.  I have full confidence Sean stands by his work, he's been over several times working around other contractors and we've had several discussions re: any concerns (or maybe his concerns...haha).  He was recommended to me by a flooring company whose installers were couple x what he charges, so the nice mgr whispered she'll email me a contact on the side who she has referred alot of biz to... I'm glad she did."
0,I have had DIRECTV  before it was called that. I installed the receiver and dish myself where it would not be bothered by anything. So I upgraded to HD DIRECTV. They sent an installer out. He put the dish where trees would grow in front of it. Not where I had installed the dish clear of any blockage. So now I get to watch a TV service that goes in and out because of loss of signal. Simply because the DIRECTV  installer would not put the receiver where I wanted it.
1,"Service was great, tables a little too snug for two people but when on their game the staff pulled dishes and stuff as quickly as possible (must have read other reviews and made improvements).  Food was very good, light flavors allow for individualizing oils, I particularly love to dip my pizza in oil, a little trick I learned growing up back east, so having spiced oil for dipping as opposed to choking on the traditional red pepper flakes was a plus in my book. The server was very sweet and friendly, decor was pleasing, bathrooms were clean on our Saturday evening visit.  Loved the little fried dough powder sugar things our server referred to as \""crack\"", indeed, addictive, nothing left on plate.  For that matter, my husband and I shared a salad and a pizza and were very full and content!  Going back with our daughter tonight, gonna try the lasagne."
1,"This is a small, no-nonsense creperie with a wide selection of items. I wanted to get something light and the associate at the counter was able to convert their Florentine Crepe into an omelet for me. The portion size was more than sufficient and the food tasted fresh. It's a great spot--very clean and they use compostable and recyclable cups, plates etc."
1,"I really appreciated that N\u00e9v\u00e9 was entirely unpretentious.  I find that so many coffee places are either pleased with being fancy coffee places or smug about their hipster self-awareness.  N\u00e9v\u00e9 was neither.  The seating was charming, the staff were incredibly friendly, and the experience was generally quite pleasant.  We were just stopping in to kill time until JR opened, so we didn't spend much time, but I can definitely imagine hanging out and doing some work while there.  I would definitely recommend N\u00e9v\u00e9."
1,"I've had a great experience here. The acupuncturist is absolutely wonderful. She is attentive and really does care about her patients. I had never done acupuncture before and I was surprised by the results I saw. I have chronic pain in my back and shoulders, and I absolutely noticed a difference. Thanks Mayo!"
1,"I wanted my first time to be in NYC, but I still had a great time at Serendipity 3 in LV.  I guess there's always a wait no matter what city you're in.  They only take RSVP 2 hrs. in advance at the earliest.  It was very windy the day my group and I went & everyone who waits, has to wait outside.  There was only 1 heat lamp next to the outdoor hostess (which you're not able to stand next to, but that doesn't matter b/c you can barely feel the heat since there is a tube around the stream of fire - probably for the drunkards who might decide to actually touch the flame).  \n\nANYWAYS,  once we got seated indoors, the atmosphere seemed very open and whimsical-like.  The menus were HUGE & I was having a hard time trying to decide on what to chow down on.  Our waiter helped me with that and I went with the Crab Cake Burger.  Once it arrived it looked AMAZING and it tasted just that.  It came with a side of fries (I ordered steak) & a really yummy dipping sauce.  The burger came with arugula and bacon, too!  YUM!  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough room for the Frozen Hot Chocolate :/  But I did manage to try a spoonful from my friend and it just reminded me of chocolate ice cream or chocolate ensure.  EH.  However, I'm willing to give the frozen hot chocolate another try... one day.  I would definitely come back for their Crab Cake Burger though!  \n\nFood my friends ordered - The Hangover Omelet (HUGE), The Sliders (comes w/ 3 of them & they look like nothing, but they apparently filled her up, but she had to order a side of fries), The Grilled Cheese which came with a side of tomato soup w/ goldfish sprinkled on top - cute (she said the sandwich was REALLY GOOD), and The Chicken Strips (comes w/ 3 dipping sauces).\n\nThe food IS on the pricey side, but the portions are huge."
1,"Been twice, amazing and fresh homemade food every time, tried three total dishes in fact. This is the kind of hole in the wall neighborhood treasure that everyone always searches for. If they keep making food this good, it will need a larger dining area. The only possible improvement would be better silverware/plates/napkins but who cares about that!"

I also got my razor scooter from circus circus, how awesome is that??\n\nI'll take Fascination (it's one of the midway games) over poker tables any day and it only costs a quarter per game!\n\nThe drawback is that my fiance loves Street Fighter arcades and he'd be glued to one looking for a challenge from another street fighter geek for an hour or so while I wandered around by myself.

0,"When you were able to smoke and drink outside the store it was a great spot despite the crazy prices for the cigars. I didn't mind paying so much because you got to sit very comfortably and relax. Those days are gone. You can only sit and smoke inside the store now and it is small! A group of six men all smoking makes the place a smoke filled mess. I love cigars but i dont want to be crammed into a place that is completely filled with smoke its not enjoyable. I know its Vegas but the cigar prices are seriously insane. I picked up two Casa Fuente cigars that are about $20 each cause you can only buy them in the store in Vegas. They are not worth it. I am a Padron fan and the Fuente cigars just never match up. Even the opus x ,anejo and forbidden dont match up sorry. If you love cigars and are going to Vegas BRING YOUR OWN. The prices for cigars anywhere on the strip are crazy. I would only consider going back to Casa Fuente if they go back to the smoking outside the store. In case you didn't get it the prices are laughable."
0,"very unhappy with our first visit.  Walked in the establishment and thought, wow what a great locals place.  Played a bit on the video poker machines. Not too bad in play, but when all said in done, played about 90.00 along with giving back about 60.00.  Received 5 beers on play. (90.00) or original play. After returning our key and said thanks to bar tender went into the parking lot.  Before we were able to leave, the bartender came running out and said we had a tab.  We were surprised because we never received any type of a slip in our glass.  When we told her we played 80.00 and left her a tip she through a fit as if we were trying to rip her off.  We are locals and have been playing around town for a long time.  We have never been treated like that before.  There are too many local places to go with good service to put up with that."

0,"I come from the San Gabriel Valley... so of course my standards for dim sum is a lot higher than the average Joe. With that said, this restaurant's food was terrible. I could tell that some of the food was the microwaveable kind and none of it tasted flavorful or fresh. The skin of the Har Gow and Shau Mai was practically melting and falling apart. The white rice cake dessert that I love love love, was also falling apart. It all tasted overly cooked/steamed and had no flavor. I guess if you are in Vegas and want dim sum, then this is a good option for you. As for me, I do not plan on coming back."

1,"Great buffet, classic setting, no complaints other than the obvious crowds.\n\nI was lucky and got here with 20 minutes left for breakfast so I paid the lower entrance fee and after my first round, they converted everything to lunch food and higher prices, so I felt like I beat the Man on that one.\n\nI am not sure if this is still the best in Vegas, as I have not been to them all, but you will be very satisfied here and the ambiance is awesome."
1,"I am a huge fan! The rolls are a big and the fish is fresh...true to their motto of \""big and fresh\"". I didn't give it 5 stars because the service was less than average. But the food and atmosphere are awesome. I am so glad that I gave this \""hole in the wall\"" a chance. I've been there 3 times now and still love it!"
1,My husband is the one who uses this place but at times I stop by and pick something up for him. This location has a lot of choices and even give you the opportunity to call ahead and they will have it ready for you. There were 4-5 staff working and a storefront of ppl. They handled each customer with time and respect! We waited for a few minutes but then were in and out. Prices are reasonable as well!
0,"My husband and I went expecting real hand battered fish, not a frozen patty from Costco and bland fries. A real let down. And they'd don't have any malt vinegar or even ketchup and their cup of sauce is just watered down cheap cocktail sauce. Not what we remember Pete's being like, the owners are clearly more interested in making a large profit than serving a quality product, which will eventually hurt their business by driving customers away. In addition, that only accept cash and the ATM on site charges $3 for a transaction. We will no go back."
0,So my wife and I have gone to this place several times now. The food isn't horrible. The price isn't horrible. The service is very horrible. Every time I go in here I feel like they think I just kicked their dog. The first couple times I thought maybe the girls serving us were just having horrible days but now every single time we have gone in there they are rude to us. I try to be extra nice to see if maybe I can get them to be decent just for a little but no luck. I'm sure they are upset that people don't tip what they think is appropriate but I know I tip very well and even did the first couple times. But I will not being going to a place where they don't appreciate my business. There are buffets on every corner and maybe they don't realize this but maybe they will when they are closed next year.
1,"Love this place, great games and library.  Great local art.  Oh, the drinks are awesome also.....  my favorite is Evil Monkey,"
1,"Hands down, best BBQ place in the C/U area. I know that's not saying a lot but this place is legit. I have eaten here more times than I can count and I have had almost everything on the menu, and I have NEVER had something I didn't like. I always get the wings as an appetizer and they are amazing! my favorite thing on the menu is the cuban sandwich which you can only get on Wednesdays but I seriously live for them. The only thing that sucks is the seating, there is always a wait but this place is worth waiting for :)"
0,"So here goes.. Like some other reviewers, I have never had a bad experience going for teppenyaki ... but, what a disaster.  \n\nSo, we made a reservation for 6pm, and when we made it, the person taking the call made it sound like they were so busy, with limited availability.  When we arrived, the restaurant was virtually empty, and with a scour (arriving at literally 6.01) the hostess snarled \""we've been waiting for you\"".. \n\nGot to the table, at 6.02, and there were 2 other people waiting, I joked.. Sorry to keep you guys waiting.  They laughed, but the last laugh was on us, because there were another 6 people joining our table with a 6.15 reservation.  \n\nI ordered a drink, neat... when it arrived, there was a piece of something floating in the glass.  I very quietly asked the hostess/manager as I'm learning to replace the drink.  She took it back to the owner of the restaurant, and the chef, who inspected the glass, and discussed it.. then nothing.\n\nThe waiter came over around 10 minutes later (we were all wondering what was going on at the table.. there was a mix of frustration and silliness because of how disorganized the place was).. No apology, the waiter asked if I would like something else.. I said sure, how about the same in a clean glass?  (in a nice way).. \n\nAnyway, here is a summary of it all.. \nFood was really a 1/5, \n\nTook 50 minutes just to see food coming to the table?  (this is cut up vegetables, and proportioned meat?)\n\n1.  my daughters chicken was placed on the grill frozen, and came like rubber.\n2.  The salad was ripped out of a bag, with some sub par Japanese dresing\n3.  The steak, was over cooked (even though we asked for it prepared rare\n4.  The salmon was fishy, and lacked any real flavor other than old stale fish.\n\nBill comes, I was double charged for the drink, and the waiter out of his pocket took out the $5 saying he would have to pay.  (go figure, I hand a dirty glass to the manager, and the poor guy has to pay)... \n\nAnyway, this place was better a couple years ago.. now its just awful (food, service you name it)... I do recommend looking elsewhere."

0,"Love the matcha green tea with boba and the sweet buttered toast is good too.  But It's a little over priced, and they could use some new staff cause the women waitresses were just rude and unhelpful."
0,Worst car wash ever. I paid for detail and I have suv. When I left I realized that they didn't even wash the floor rugs. Or the backs or the seats or in between the seats in the front. If this is a detail I would hate to see what a regular car wash is? So after I paid a butt load of money plus tip I came home...and still had to clean it... When I should have just drove it back and made U do ur JOB I paid u to do the 1st time. But I live on the other side of town and I was frustrated And I should have looked before I left. I was just sick of waiting around at that point. Get some new workers. People that want to do there job
1,"I love this mall.  It is big but not crazy like scottsdale fashion park.  This is where I go when I have to really do some shopping.  The mall has pretty much all of the typical stores that you find in most malls.  The anchor stores are Dillards, Macys, Nordstroms and Sears.  \n\nI also like the setup of the restaurants and then a short walk to the  Harkins movie theater.  There is also a food court located in the center of the mall with all the typical - paradise bakery, pizza, mcd's, etc.\n\nParking is also ample and during the holidays you can valet."
1,I was here Friday night for the Las Vegas Invitational basketball tournament.  Parking was easy.  Nice well-kept smaller arena.  Typical food and beverage selections.  Good lines of sight.  I like it!
0,"Portions were really small. I didn't want a snack size, I wanted a daddy size. And when they ask if you want coffee, they say *is an Americano okay? That's not coffee. It's espresso and water."
0,"My husband tried to change his order literally thirty seconds after he placed it and was told it was too late. When he went to pick up our food, the soup I had specifically requested be spicy was NOT spicy at all and they packaged it up totally carelessly so that most of it spilled out on the way home. When he told them he was never, ever coming back there because of his bad experience, they just shrugged. Since I'm currently home sick and most places are closing and I need spicy soup in order to live through the night I am seriously considering plastering their windows with fliers that say 'FUCKING RUDE ASSHOLES WITH BAD SOUP' after my recovery from the flu.\n\nObviously, this is totally fucking unacceptable and extremely bad business. \n\nI order a ridiculous amount of thai food and will never be back to this place - this is my karmic retribution for trying to stray from Siam Terrace."
1,"Kevin is very friendly and wants you to understand what is going on. He demonstrates that he likes what he does and has a good attitude. My compressor died and since the inside coil was also falling apart, we decided to replace all but the furnace. He took a little bit longer than he said but this is to be expected sometimes. The price was great. He also gave me some good information for the future. I would use In Phase again."
1,"my favourite place for a power lunch\n\nor \n\nawesome dinner\n\nif it's not too hot, sit outside and enjoy the amazing view\n\ntry the flatbreads\nthe desert\n&\napparently\nthe martinis\n\nand then do some shopping!!!"
1,"Elements has several locations throughout Phoenix. I was visiting over Christmas, and my family highly recommended them.  I was in pain with restless legs, so was very happy that I was able to get in on short notice. They also offer special introductory rates for visitors, which they offered to extend if I wanted to book another treatment during my stay.  Overall, I was very happy with my massage and the therapist. She worked out all of the kinks and I enjoyed the rest of my holiday pain-free. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale."
1,This place is the BEST GELATO EVER. For 2 reasons really.\n1. Every flavor is addictive and delicious. \n2. The owners of this quaint little place are the sweeeeetest most adorable people I have ever met. \nThey were needlessly friendly and helpful. Every time I come I get their strawberry. Large of course.
1,"If I had known my husband was going to take me here for dinner after watching a movie, I would have worn clubbing outfit. This place is trendy and if you dine here, you can skip the lines and get access to Palm's Moon and Playboy Club. I loved the entrees.  We had the Veal Nove and the Nove Spaghetti.  Both were really, really good.  I honestly think that if the dish has the restaurant's name on it, then more than likely, it has bragging rights.  \n\nNove Italiano is your quintessential club scene Vegas dining. It boasts views of the strip.  The menu is priced accordingly for the kind of restaurant that it is.  The wine list is decent.\n\nDid I mention the spaghetti was really good?  I mean really."
1,Went today for lunch.  Saw a article in the Las Vegas paper.  I had the Oggie (traditional for me of course) and my wife had the Bangers and Mash.  Both were excellent.  I am a genuine Yooper having eaten my first pasty over 60 years ago.  The Oggie was better than many of the ones found at roadside Finnish Pasty shops in Da UP (Upper Peninsula of Michigan) and on par with some of the homemade ones I've had.  Next time I might try something different because they have a huge variety.
1,"Had a couple entrees delivered and I was disappointed. After reading the mix of reviews here I knew what to expect - good chinese food. I wasn't let down. The spicy entrees were spicy, the breading was what east coast chinese offers and the rice was just sticky enough.\nOverall we had a good meal and it wasn't pricey. \nWe will definitely be ordering from here again!"
0,Legendarily lame.\n\nThis place has managed to successfully wage a campaign against fun for more than a decade. Tactics include: carefully measuring out each shot with a measuring cup while making mixed drinks and charging four dollars above market price for shitty food.\n\nGoing to legends is like having the hot water cut out in the middle of a shower. \nIt's like getting your scrotum caught while zipping up your fly. \nIt's like watching Schindler's List during a bachelor party. \nIt's like clogging the toilet at your girlfriend's parent's house. \n\nNot fun at all.
1,"beautiful new office but I had never been to their old one, overall was satisfied with the staff but only got to see the Nurse practitioner but not the Dermatologist on my first Visit, I do have follow up visit which I hope I will eventually get to see the Doctor Romina as well. staff were very professional and I was satisfied with my diagnosis and treatment"
1,"From my experience of seeing Ricky Gervais' Fame tour here, I found the Festival Theatre to be satisfying place to watch his stand up show.\n\nOk, the bars are rammed at the intervals, but they always are in theatres.  The seating was fine with no obvious focus on comfort, but nonetheless didn't restrict the blood flow to my derriere after a the 2 hour performance. \n\nThe big glass facade is great too, adding to the grand style of the building."
1,"I went for brunch for two times, and really enjoyed their food and seating.  Omelets are so good. If the weather is not so hot, you can just sit outside chilling with your friends by the street side. Now whenever i feel like a brunch, Ncounter just pops up in my head. Love it!"
1,"The night I visited it was the Trailer Trash Bash event. Wow, what a sight to see. I have heard that a new kind of night is created each month for the locals and visitors to enjoy. There is a large dance floor area and two bars, one on each side. There is a pool table on the North East corner. The center piece for this nightclub is the giant armadillo disco ball.\n\nI had a good time at the venue, the DJ played music the crowd liked and the staff seemed friendly enough. $2 entry and similarly priced draft beers, at the time of this review, should be enough to bring in even the most price conscious consumer. The entry to the nightclub was complimentary and was not in trade for a review."
0,"I just opened up the $13 tights for my 4yr old. I noticed a snag on the left thigh. I called the store to see if I could come in and exchange or return them. They said that tights are considered \""final sale\"" and they can not be exchanged or returned. Beware of purchasing from stores like this. I will not be shopping here and don't recommend others unless you open up and examine your entire purchase before you go home."
0,"Let me start off by saying if I could give the MGM Grand 0 stars that would be generous.\n\nAfter partying at Club Rain all night at the Palms with some friends, my boy and I decided to go back to their hotel room since they were staying there. It was 5 A.M. and me, my boy, and a friend decided to go downstairs to do a lil gambling even though we were pretty exhausted. Being that I was the only one with like 15 bucks I gambled and lost immediately. I had to go to the bathroom so I told them I would be right back.\n\nUpon entering the bathroom the cleaning guy told me to go to the back as he was cleaning the front area which I was going to anyway. While I walking towards the back it smells like weed which I could care less cause I dont smoke, and it didnt bother me. \n\nAfter about 40 seconds of being in the stall security comes in and says outloud \""This is MGM security and we have the sheriff outside, anyone smoking marijuana better stop right now\"". Ummm ok, I didnt really pay attention because it wasnt me. So I get a knock on the door saying sir was it you, and I just replied no man I am not smoking.\n\nSo when I get out of the stall here is the bozo security guards waiting for me to get out. He starts to accuse me of smoking the week, and then after I told him didnt i tell you it wasnt me and told him not only do I not smell like weed I dont have anything on me. He says \""you flushed it\"", so by this time I am already aggrivated so I shun him off to go wash my hands. As soon as I reach the sink the bathroom is bumrushed with security, supervisors, and a sheriff. Now I am surrounding by staff accusuing me of smoking in the bathroom off of a few allegations. Now I am beyond mad, and start to really please my case in the most vulgar way possible. My boy comes in to see what was going on and hes upset at well. They take both of out ID's and write down our information, and I am shaking I am so pissed. One of the 10$ an hour security guards proceeds to tell me \""for future reference next time you walk in a bathroom and it smells like weed, you should go to another.\""\n\nAfter telling us we need to leave the premise, I go back and ask on what basis do you have to kick us out. The guy says we have a guy who saw you go into the stall (ok), we have a guy who knocked on your door (ok), so I said basically nothing. He then tells me it boild down to \""WE DONT WANT YOUR BUSINESS\"",  you are 86'd from MGM and all casinos affiliated with MGM. I pretty much tell him to fuck off.\n\nI still plan to write a letter, I have never been so offended. Not only do I feel it was defamation of character, I felt like not one person used procedure to fully get all the details.\n\nI dont have any respect for MGM, and plan to never come back here my entire life."
1,Love anytime fitness! I go to the one on Rainbow. Have a great personal trainer named Nate if anyone is looking for one. There is never a lot of people here so there's always machines available to use. There's tanning for $20 a month if you want to use that. Only downside of this location is no showers.
0,"Very poor service, I was seated for 20 min before they took my order or even offered me a beverage. I would have left but did not want to deal with a disappointed 3 year old. I will not return to this location and will not leave a tip of any amount. I have been here before, with good service, not sure what happened."
0,Used to be great. Now it's a waste of time and poorly run and managed. Why in the world would you have someone with no experience running the place on a Saturday evening?\n\nNo kind of help. This place used to be a great place to learn about wines and talk with the employees.
0,"I've been thinking to try this place for ever. I finally did and I'm sad to report that per my taco standards it's barely OK.\n\nI got 2 al pastor and 2 carne asada tacos. I also ordered the \""cuatro\"" (chips, salsa, guacamole and beans). \n\nBesides the $21 that this cost me, the food was absolutely uneventful. The tortillas were cold, the beans were lacking flavor, the salsa was meh and the guacamole was average.\n\nThe al pastor tacos were kind of sweet and if you've read my comments before, you know that I can't stand the heartbreaking moment when you expect something (because they name their dish the same of something you're craving) and you get something totally different or at least far enough from the real thing.\n\nThe carne asada tacos were OK but they had this indescribable green topping that was totally unexpected (in a bad way). I don't know what it was but i believe there was some onion and celery involved. Not authentic at all, at least nothing I've ever seen in Mexico.\n\nVeredict:\n\nIf you pass by, it's OK for a quick bite with low expectations, otherwise, I wouldn't crave it.\n\nCheers."
0,Connie lady is a b*#%! Worst customer service ever. If you don't understand what she tells you she will yell at you like you're dumb. Everyone in that office needs to learn what customer service means. We stopped by at the office for a few questions and told us to call instead because idk they're always busy doing shit. This lady yelled at us while answering our questions so I hope their business would close down or hire new employees.\nUsually they have a receptionist to answer basic question but we spoke to a Rude lady with no manners. I don't think they care about what customer service means probably the lack of their English speaking skills but I'm so happy our lease ended with these people.
1,"Adorable. Such an intimate date restaurant, you can't beat the ambiance here.\n\nI had a French Martini which was fine. We were only snacking, but the pretzels are a must try. WOW! I'll be back again."
1,"We were here last Saturday and had a really good time. The steaks were delicious and the service was good. Hubby had the swordfish and was over the moon about it (it was his first time having it)\nMy only complaint was that the music was REALLY loud for a restaurant but hey, we were entertained. \nWe had a great evening and look forward to returning next time we are craving steak!"
0,"I came to the movie theatre to watch 22 Jump Street, the movie was funny and didn't disappoint but the movie theatre was nothing special. The floors were sticky, the nachos were stale and the drink machine was broken. So it was not very different from any other movie house. The movie was funny but I am sure the Dutches of Surprise and I could have found a better way to spend $45 on a weeknight out. The one thing that really did disappoint me was the fact that they did not do a military discount on the tickets. I am not one to ask for a military discount and I hardly ever do, I actually get annoyed when army wives get all uppety when they don't get their military discount (you aren't in the military so shut up) but I am used to getting my military discount at the movies, I guess I am spoiled that way. Anyways, you charge exorbitant prices, you don't clean your theatre, your soda machine is broken and you make billions of dollars but you can't give a hard working army guy 10% off his ticket? It's whatever, but I'm still a little jaded. Say something nice, the soda jerk was nice and pleasant but the guy who sells the tickets was kinda douchey. Oh yeah, go watch 22 Jump Street, it's as funny as the first one."
1,I love this place! We eat here at least three times a month. My fiance loves the roasted 1/2 chicken and I absolutely love the Shrimp Pita or Mediterranean Salad with Shrimp. \n\nIts an inexpensive place where you can get a quick meal but a quality meal that is tasty and healthy.. The food doesn't taste processed and its yummy..  \n\nThey have the best service and the owner is extremely accommodating. We have catered with them before and they give you a lot of food for what you pay for. \n\nOverall one of our favorite places to dine at when we are short on time..
0,"Not to be a negative Nancy (for those nanc-ily-named ladies, no offense) but I was not impressed.  We arrived early for our reservation (not needed) and were seated.  The waitress came up with the typical... \""may I get you fellers some drinks\"" and we were well on our way to a great evening.  After about 5 minutes or so, she returned to ask if we would like to order, knowing that we were waiting on the rest of our party.  I thought it was interesting that she would ask that...  and by interesting, I mean sufficiently awkward.  How do you respond to that anyway?  \""Oh, yes, I'll have the special and when our friends arrive you can get their order when you bring us our food\""  \nSecond... for the price, the food was just ok...  Steak and shrimp, means, steak and two shrimp...  It was cute...  something I would expect from the kiddie menu...  The pasta that I ordered was ok...  swimming in oil and other than some EVOO there wasn't much flavor to the overcooked penne.   \nThe desserts were proportionately small and the tiramisu was dry, dry, dry!\nFinally... the check comes around and the currency exchange takes place... Naturally, the group we were with began conversation only to be interrupted by the waitress to ask if we were done signing the credit slips!  I honestly can't believe that we were asked that!  The other couple of (non yelpers) still hadn't signed there slip!!!  \nSo, Caffe Siena, I'm not a fan.... sorry :(("
0,"If I could I give no star, I would! Service was really really bad and racist! Food was overpriced and didn't taste good. This is one of the worst restaurant I have been too. Stay away!"
0,The food is wonderful but the staff is a disappointment!! They forgot to give me my mandarin sauce on the side and I called and they just hung up on me.
1,Best pizza of my entire life.   No pizza on Sunday though...
1,"Looking for a quick sugar fix after dinner last week, the family went to Cream City to check it out.  I love sweets as much as the next guy, but my wife and son are the real driving force here.  We've only lived in Phoenix for a couple of months and it seems like we've already hit all of the dessert places around.  Good thing it's so sunny here all of the time compared to Ohio so I can run these calories off.\n\nAnyway, this place is a hidden gem.  They do homemade ice cream, sorbet, and gelato as well as soups and sandwiches.  The menu looked really good, but like I said, we stuck to the sugar.  We all opted for gelato and I have to say, it was just as good as anything I've had outside of Italy. The staff was very helpful and overall great.  \n\nThis place is dangerous being right across the street from our neighborhood! Great job, keep it up!"
0,"This is the worst Wendy's I've been too !!!\nThe food comes out nasty looking, smashed, looks like it's been sitting for a while.....fries are either cold or way over salted!!!\ncashiers are to busy flirting with the boys that come in.\nSeems management doesn't care either.....\nRestrooms are always dirty at every visit I've been there.\nLast time I went.......about Sept of 2010, never going back."
1,"This place was a lifesaver - was in Phoenix on a road trip when all three children got sick.  Must have been from all the candy and Thanksgiving food etc. at grandmas the day before.  They were in need of some good \""home-style\"" chicken soup.  Well, in the area we were staying there was a CVS and Circle K on every corner yet no possible place for soup.  I also stopped into three separate Subways who all had only broccoli cheese soup... weird ...  then I turned a corner and there it was Boston Market, place was empty as if they were waiting for me.  I got two dinner plates and a huge family size chicken soup, great great service, extra bowls and plates etc, Rushed it back to the hotel.  Kids ate, tummys felt better and they went to sleep.  Mission accomplished!  The food is fresh and has that home made feel/taste...  What a welcome thing on a long road trip."
1,Got on the El Pollo Train back in college and gave it a try last week and was it ever wonderful & cheap!!!  This must be a weekly visit...thats all there is to say!!!
1,"Been here almost a dozen times; always satisfied and no complaints. \nService is always good,  the food and drinks are  always tasty,  ambiance is kick back,  today(Sunday late  afternoon) they had a two- man band that is awesome to listen to, and it's never over- crowded or too loud like their sister restaurant,  Gallo Blanco.  \nYou can't go wrong with their menu, it's simple to understand and well thought out! A must try!"
1,"I love this place! I took my sister here one day for a \""girls day\"" breakfast before pedicures and it's fantastic. Very friendly staff, great, fun menu. Wonderful, friendly atmosphere overall. I've only been here for breakfast so far, but the portions were large and filling, and the mimosa was perfect. :)\n\nI have yet to try their delivery service, but definitely plan to do so. They hop on their bikes and deliver your food to you by BIKE. How cute is that?!"
1,"I've been to a several Valley resort spas and this one doesn't disappoint.  \n\nI guess rating and reviewing spas can be a bit tricky as not only treatments depend upon the staff but expectations and use of the facilities varies from person to person.  I'm a massage fan and love to use the steam, sauna, pool, and workout facilities.  Plush lounge areas and well-stocked shower and locker rooms are pluses.\n\nThe pool and pool area at this resort spa was the biggest that I've experienced.  Plenty of lounge chairs and a swimming area larger than average.  I also enjoyed 1 of the 2 outdoor showers.  Can't explain it but you'll know what i mean when you try it.  Made me want 2 get one for my home.\n\nBut i digress, the spa also has a decent cafe overlooking the pool area and the upstairs lounge area was very comfortable.  Need to go back soon!"
1,"They are AWESOME! Tammie the owner and her awesome assistant walked me through buying, having and maintaining chickens. I bought my chicken coop, a couple chicks, organic feed, water food and feed containers. That was a few months ago and things are great! I am so thankful for this feed store! Never been to better!"
0,"Uhh..I expected so much better. We stayed at the Vdara for two nights for a trade show and in the morning I just couldn't wait to go to the lounge and have a good breakfast. Then disappointment hit me in the face...smoothies were terrible. I ordered a yoghurt parfait and it came out with an old yoghurt which was bitter due to the reason that it went bad! I sent it back and refused to eat it but the server still wanted to claim that this type of yoghurt had to be bitter as hell. I've eaten all the types of yoghurt on the world even in Greece and please do not tell me that because it was Greek yoghurt it was bitter. The rest of the orders were horrible too and they made us wait 20 minutes for our check because they had to wait for the manager to cancel my rotten yoghurt order. \nDuring the day next to the pool, all the cocktail waitresses are ignorant and you can;t get a drink for like 20 minutes. \nVdara rooms YES, Vdara pool lounge NO"
1,"How is it that I am the first to review this place? It is a classic, and it is always busy! Go figure? \n\nJulio's Too is the take-out version of it's big brother Julio G's, the menus are the same but the prices are sure not! Julio's Too is very reasonably priced, and offers the same quality of food as the main restaurant. The lunch specials are amazing, with most being around just $6.00!! They too have my beloved Jalapeno Cream Cheese, and I usually end up ordering a half-pint to take home with me. \n\nI love the flautas, green chile burritos, shredded beef tacos and the mini chimis. Their salsa is very addicting, I just wish that they gave you more with your take-out order. The only flaw I find with Julio's Too is the beans. I am a bean connoisseur, and their beans just do not quite stack up to the others out there. They are just lacking that special something. When I have a craving for Mexican food, I usually lean towards Julio's because it is close to home, fast and cheap, but sometimes when I am really in the mood for some good beans, I have to go somewhere else with better beans! \n\nBut even with the questionable beans, I am still there quite frequently."
1,Every time I come here I always get friendly service and delectable treats! The candy apples and fudge are to die for. Highly recommend while you are in Lake Las Vegas.
0,"Very slow service on a Saturday afternoon with only 1/2 the restaurant full.\n\nTwo of us ordered our pizzas before another friend came. The third person came at least 15min after we ordered and had to wait for our waiter to put his order in.  After about 30min from our initial order, the manager came over and said our order was \""getting sorted out\""--which was the first we'd heard of an issue. Our pizzas finally all came out together, still with no apology or even acknowledgement from our waiter that there had been some kind of issue.\n\nWe left Tempe Marketplace after finishing and while at another store, I realized that I didn't have my Visa from CPK. I realized that the waiter never gave it back. So I had to take our entire party back to Tempe Marketplace, park, and walk back on a 110 degree day. \n\nWhen I got there, I told the woman at the front desk that the waiter hadn't returned my card. She told me to get out my ID and someone would be with me. Then she turned and did a walk through the restaurant, filling water, collecting plates, etc without telling anyone that we were waiting. Eventually, the manager came out and just handed back my card, with no apology for the waiter keeping the card to begin with. \n\nI should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant and I have been reminded again why I don't. Don't waste your time with terrible service."
0,"This place is such a rip off it's actually so disrespectful. Ordered a smoked salmon on bagel plate, and it didn't come with cream cheese. When I asked for some cream cheese, they gave me a small packet of philadelphia cream cheese and charged me $2 for it. No, they did not let me know beforehand that they'd charge me $2 for one packet of factory made cream cheese. That happened a couple months ago, but today my friend told me that they charged her $2.50 for a side of sour cream without teling her beforehand, so it motivated me to actually write about this stuff on Yelp.\n\nThe actual food is good, although truly overpriced. I just really find this sneakily charging outrageous prices for sauces so disrespectful to its customers."
0,"Perhaps I had a different experience because I ate a catered sandwich by them. My company ordered 200 boxed sandwich lunches today and I was incredibly disappointed. We have used many other sandwiches places in the past, but wanted to try something new. The bread was stale, they were very stingy with the meat, the choco chip cookie was burnt and tasted like it came out of a packaged box.  I am really disappointed in their catering services. I won't spend my own money on a sandwich here, which is sad because other people gave it such great reviews."
1,"BEING SORT OF A NARCISSIST, I STARTED WRITING A MEMOIR...\n\nCHAPTER 3:   WHAT I LEARNED IN JUNIOR HIGH\nInspired after reading about Pablo Picasso's legendary ways with women, I drew a beautiful pastel of a girl I had a crush on.  Surprising Tomiko with the portrait totally creeped her out and she never spoke to me again.  I learned that females are not impressed by something you spent hours creating in a basement.\n\nCHAPTER 28:  I SEDUCE A WOMAN WITH ART\nI invited my sweetie to dinner at Picasso Restaurant.  Fine dining beside Bellagio's synchronized fire-hydrants while surrounded by 50 million dollars worth of genuine Picasso paintings appears to have a certain effect on women.  The coveted table #34 has the best view of said fountains.  Using the opportunity to charm my sweetie with my knowledge of art, I explained that the colorful squiggles on the dinner plates were identical to the Picasso designs I'd seen at Museu Picasso in Barcelona.  I also freestyle-critiqued a few of the paintings on the walls (secretly, I couldn't name any of them).  As we enjoyed the magnificent meal, I commented that Chef Julian Serrano is like an artist, then immediately regretted making such a banal comparison.  My sweetie was too deep in a state of rapture to care."
1,5 starts for a Eye Doctor? \n\nYep thats how I roll. I have been going to Joel for about 5 years and never been disappointed. His staff is super friendly and I don't have any complaints whatsoever.
1,"From lemon drop to IPA, this place is the real deal!"
1,From the moment I walked into this store; the service and attention I received was top notch! Daniel Doria must have spent at least 45 minutes trying to resolve my phone issue.  I never once felt rushed or like another customer. I felt valued! Even Tyse stepped in to help by calling corporate for assistance. The professionalism exhibited by the employees and the ability to resolve my problem places this business at the top of my list for OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!
1,"Went here for the dinner buffet. Ate only the seafood items which were delicious. Salmon, bluefin, shrimp, crablegs. Also had watermelon. Good Value for the money if you stick with the seafood. Can't comment on other items since I was stuffed after two full plates of nothing but seafood items. The desserts looked good tho!"
1,"ATD has always gone way beyond what is normally expected to help me with my automotive repairs.  They were able to fixed the AC in my truck and get me back on the road within one day during the middle of the summer when I was traveling from Southern California to Utah and then through Phoenix.  They also do great work on the fabrication and repairs for my sandcar.  They are knowledgeable, helpful and honest.  I highly recommend ATD to anyone for automotive repairs and off-road fabrication. Thanks Craig, Shannon and the rest of the crew at ATD for the great work you do."
0,I am not sure what the hype is all about.  I ordered a Beach and received cold hard bread and the most tasteless sandwich I have ever had.  My husband thought his sandwich was very bland as well and asked for some salt and pepper only to be told they do not have any.  Also the service is lacking in my opinion.  They said hello when we walked in and thank you when we left but in between the service was sub-par.  I felt like I was annoying the cashier when I ordered my sandwich.  Then I seemed to annoy her more when I asked if there was a drink chip combo....The guy who told my husband that they don't have salt and pepper lacked customer service skills in a big way.  If you want fast this is the place for you...but if you want anything else like good food or good customer service I suggest you take your business elsewhere.
0,"I had been planning to go to House of Tricks for quite some time, but when I finally did I was very disappointed. As a general restaurant I'd probably give it 3 stars, but the price range demands higher expectations. The service seemed very unprofessional, our server didn't know anything about the dishes or wines. I ordered a tenderloin cooked medium-rare and it came out medium-well. In addition, the quality of the meat was definitely below par for a $35+ steak."
1,"It was Anniversary time! But we didn't' want to spend a ton of money on food or booze. Plus, were weren't interested in going to a show at the time. So, what to do?\n\nAquarium!\n\nDon't get me wrong: This place is TINY! Narrow walk ways and close quarters in general. Even the exhibits are small. I do hope that all of the animals in there are ok. They do seem treated well but I wonder if they would be happier with larger homes. i think the most open area is at the very end, the shark tank.\n\nSpeaking of said tank, it was TOTALLY the highlight of this place. They built it so it looks like a sunken ship and it is SO creepy. It's very dark and all these frikin horrifying sharks are swimming around...\n\n...Their eyes... Dead eyes...\n\n\nI will admit that it is overpriced. Like... REAL overpriced. Over $30.00 per person!? Not to mention (totally mentioning) the picture when you leave is stupid expensive. $20.00 for 1 picture? That is Disneyland prices! Are we IN Disneyland!? No we are not. Check yourself my friend.\n\nStill it is one of the only places left in Vegas that doesn't have practically naked women for all the little kids to see. Points for that."
0,Thought I would come here and get my oil changed with a free wash. Well. Won't do that again. Oil change costs less at the dealer. They said the wait for the oil change was 15 minutes but the wash would take a lot longer. The free wash is just a run through and no dry. So I upgrade. I come out after the oil change and there are only two cars ahead of me. The girl working on my car is too busy talking with every one else and not working much on my car. This is silly. My last visit here. $87 total bill. (Including air filter)
1,You can find any and all your kitchen needs here! My secret ingrediant in a lot of things is truffle oil...$17/bottle... makes everything special.

1,"This food truck/trailer is a must visit. Creole Cooking that is Oh So Good! The gumbo was phenomenal as is the shrimp, and I am not a shrimp fan in the least. To say I'd order a Shrimp Basket for myself should speak volumes about the skill with which Sandra crafts her offerings.\n\nFrom Shreveport, Louisiana, Sandra bring a wealth of Creole knowledge and you'll be glad you sought out her truck with every tasty, savory bite! Sandra, herself, is such a nice, personal, ebullient lady, serving up heaping helpings of friendly chitchat along with her catfish, shrimp and porkchop po' boys done the right way.\n\nBe sure to follow her on Twitter (@SandraDeesFoods) to find out where she's parking the trailer and get yourself some Good Eats!"

My tab for 2 people with a few beers was just under 50$ don't get me wrong the food was good but this place could be waayyy more enjoyable"
0,"Haulin Balls had us sold with the menu, being big fans of lamb we went with the Zorba. By the sounds of it it should've been a homerun, meaty lamb balls, fresh herbs, feta and tzatziki. It was fine, but pretty unmemorable. Had it not been our least tasty bite at StrEATS it might have been forgotten altogether."

It is a diner, so not a pristine place.\n\nRecommend you take guests from out of town to this favorite of mine. You cannot go wrong here!"
0,"Tried to rip me off by charging me $22,000 for a car that was $17,000 right on their website!  Because my car is \""so rare\"", meanwhile another Honda dealership found FOUR of them..... Also explained it wouldn't be a \""hard hit\"" on my credit and it was 5 hard hits a day for 3 days! I will never go back again .....this is the 2nd bad experience here and with the same type of car. Funny, after I complained they said they'd honor the internet price and we can finish up the sale. Never."
0,"It took me 30 minutes until my pizza was cool enough to put in my mouth without fear of scalding my tongue and rendering me mute. When I was able to safely eat my order it was very \""meh\"". There's no real taste and it looks like they just pulled it out of a grease sauna.\n\nThe interior looks like they gutted a Chompies and tried to fill it in a quarter of the space.\n\nThe service was mediocre at best. For a place that small and with all the waiters going around, how hard is it to drop by the table more than twice?\n\nThere's nothing really NY about this place. The rape scene with Harvey Keitel in Bad Lieutenant would've been a more enjoyable and a NY experience than eating at this place was."
1,"I haven't lived in Charlotte that long and I saw Nicks was also new so I decided to try it. Best decision I have made since I moved down here... As soon as me and my girlfriend  walked in we were greeted by 2 very nice young ladies who escorted us to our table. We were greeted by our server very quickly. The atmosphere was very inviting and pleasant. Me and my girlfriend decided to get the blue crab and artichoke casserole as an appetizer to share. The potato chips served with it were fantastic, I would definitely get it again. We then got our salads, I have never been a blue cheese fan but their wedge salad with blue cheese dressing was the perfect size and was amazing, words cant even describe how awesome it was! My girlfriend ordered the Salmon which she actually got to decide how it was prepared which was very nice. It was very fresh and flavorful! I ordered the filet mignon with a pimento cheese crust. BEST FILET I HAVE EVER HAD. The best part about our experience was that we had multiple servers ask us how we were doing, kind of like a team effort which was really nice. We usually don't get dessert but we decided to get the cheesecake with a raspberry sorbet topping, again words cant describe how great it was. My girlfriend ended up eating most of it! I would definitely recommend Nicks Steak and Taphouse and I will be going back as soon as I get the chance!"
0,I suffer from leg pain in my calf where Michael herion lasered my veins. The vein I went in for help with ( one visible large varicose vein) was left open and one of my healthy functioning vein valve got sealed shut. So needless to say the bad functioning vein is Worse. I have to live in pain in that calf area. I have to live with fear of one of the blood clots I get will be a bad one. Thanks for disrupting my life Michael Herion. Thanks for lying to me telling me vein is closed when every other ultrasound tech says it's open. Thanks for painful procedure . I should have sued.(Back in 2008)
0,"I understand it is not a fine dinning restaurant but when I get bad customer service from the manager herself, that's terrible. She was wearing a different uniform, she is May be the team leader or the manager. I went there in the morning just to get some coffee. She was behind the cash, busy texting on her phone while taking my order and she had me repeat what I want because clearly she was not paying attention. I found that a bit too much. One more thing, every other staff I saw there was wearing a hair net except for her which is not hygienic. I would never order food at that location."
0,"I was very disappointed. The sushi had no taste, the sushi rice on the rolls were warm, the service was slow, and really for an AYCE menu they didn't have that many choices. My all time favorite AYCE sushi joint offers far more choices, the staff is always checking to see if we need to order more rolls (so there is no wait in between our rolls) and the sushi has flavor."
1,Helicopter tour at dusk over the strip. Excellent ride. Excellent customer service. Must do on the bucket list. Definitely ride with doors off.
1,"in my opinion, french food in california has lost much of its luster...mainly because of the ban on the sale of Foie Gras.  not to say that french cuisine is solely dependent on this fatty liver of goose or duck...its because...well, yeah...its because we dont have foie gras anymore and the food and menu's just arent the same...\n\nhad dinner at The French Laundry the other day...no foie gras on the menu...dinner sucked.\n\none meal at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon...whats on the menu? oh whuuuut? foie? GAME OVER...hands down best meal of my year up to date...\n\ni basically had a dinner that consisted of foie gras prepared several ways, along with having some fresh uni...that was all.\n\ngood thing about this place is that you dont NEED to do a prix fixe menu...you simply choose what you want to eat and make your own 3-10 course meal yourself (granted, it might be cheaper to do the set menu...i learned this the hard way)\n\nso if you live in california...and you miss your foie gras...this place is a must try restaurant...and if there is one thing on the menu i would recommend...PLEASE GET THE FOIE GRAS SLIDERS...they will change your life."
0,"Maybe I have been ordering the wrong menu items, but the only thing I have tried that was really good was the baked brie.  They also serve decent desserts. I have never tried it, but  the Turkey Devonshire was featured on the Food Network.  The Buffalo Chicken sandwich was really messy, and not very good. During another visit,  I had some kind of other chicken sandwich that was completely smothered in bleu cheese.  The last time I went, I ordered a burger, cooked to medium.  It was very undercooked to the point of being practically raw.  As they were very busy, I didn't mention the problem to the waitress, who seemed friendly but overwhelmed.  \n\nThe restaurant itself has a nice, neighborhood bar and grill vibe.  If I ever go back, I would probably just sit at the bar and get appetizers."
1,"The service and food were very good. The place is hard to find, as it's hidden next to a Gentlemen's club. Don't let it fool you! Only been open about 2 months but worth a visit. Food was spicier than I like, but good."
1,"Initally had a few concerns but sat down down with Jason and handled everything that needed taken care of. I appreciated the fact that Jason took the time to do so, I just wish it would have happened sooner. \n\nThe car looked great after addressing the inital concerns we had and everything has been up to par and working since. \n\nI wish  this company nothing but the best and DO believe that any issues they had/have will be fixed from here on out. \n\nI WOULD suggest giving them a try, the waive the deductable deal is a deal you just cant beat!"
0,"A very dated, old hotel with only one pool that is crowded. Terrible coffee shops with terrible quality food court. Yuck!!!!!!"
1,"Yes. This is a great place for slightly higher quality bar food.  The portions are large and the service is great.\n\nThis was a pre-concert spot to satisfy hunger and booze needs and it did the job.  A great spot for large groups, I believe happy hour specials as well.\n\nLobster Roll for the win! \n\nI highly recommend checking out this spot, you will be happy."
1,"Wow is a slight understatement when it comes to my experience here tonight. My family and I were introduced to Presto Cafe by Chris Herrin the owner of http://www.yelp.com/biz/bread-and-butter-henderson !  \nWe had a smorgasbord of a little of everything that this place has to offer and OMG what an experience.\n \nI love how everything is fresh and beautifully prepared.  I felt like my taste buds went on a well fed tour around the world. Lots of freshly prepared salads both savory and sweet, wonderful smoothies with real fruit ( not the pre-packed processed stuff with ice and sugar) \n\nThe pida's were divine too ! We got to try a little of each flavor and I think I am in love with all of them ! \n\nWe also tried a few of the sandwiches, I brought home a ham one with a nice surprise of Funyuns in it.  We also tried the Ruben that is made with a raisin rye that was right on with the right amount of tang to the coleslaw !\n\nTo finish the night we were treated to a nice coconut pastry and a wonderful nut/raisin tart that really completed the meal !!\n\nNeedless to say this place was worthy of a review, the owners were great, explaining their love of food  in their life and travels and wanting to bring a new fresh concept to the Spanish Trails neighborhood and they certainly brought that to the plate here.  \n\nPrice point wise your getting an excellent meal for the price, the Pida's are more than enough to feed two people and the salads are filling as well. \n\nThere is nothing like going to a place where you can feel the love in the food and wanting to express that in the most sincere way."
1,This is by far my favorite pizza place in arizona. It is inexpensive and the slices are huge and delicious! Can't get any better.
0,"It's cheap. That's about the only desirable thing about this buffet. Most of the food is heated and served straight out of the freezer. There were many things about this place that made it feel unsanitary. The waiter was awful and didn't even know the drink choices, I had to use the same fork for dinner & desert. And all the deserts are soggy or bland. They made sushi with American white rice and 'steak night' was overcooked frozen strip steak. Save your money & buy a deep fried Oreo at Nathan's inside the Mermaid Hotel."
1,"Once a month my girlfriends and I get together for a long overdue \""Girls' Night\""!! This month we had the pleasure of trying out Baku, which is centrally located on Sharon Rd. across from South Park Mall. \n\nUn-freaking-believable!!! There was something for everyone, I'm not kidding!! We decided to start with a few sushi and sashimi dishes to share while we discussed wine and sake options with our server, whom I might add was charming, accommodating, friendly, and overall extremely helpful and patient with all of our questions. He picked out a few bottles of sake for our table to share based on listening to our likes and dislikes, delicious! \n\nNext, we decided to continue our experience with some skewers (the pork belly are to die for) and some small bites (2 words: roasted oysters). As new food came, so did new plates, the staff definitely made us feel as if they too, wanted us to have an amazing experience. We tried everything! We ended our meal with surf and turf and vegetable courses, including the spicy filet, lamb chops, duck, Madagascar prawn (you have to see this thing!), black cod, salmon, grilled baby artichokes, and portobello mushrooms. \n\nWe were so stuffed after trying so many delicious items, we almost passed on dessert.... J/k!! We decided to share the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, mango toffee cake, and assorted sorbets. Holy cow!!!! \n\nFrom the decor and ambiance, to the attentiveness and outstanding service, I know I'll be back and I know we will also be back for more \""Girls' Nights\"" in the near future. This may just be my new favorite restaurant!!"
1,"I didn't really \""get it\"".\nI was expecting more Island style food, or more adventurous treats.\n\n*  Bar was great.\n*  Tuna Poke thing was fantastic.\n*  Cajun burger was terrific, but the bun was too dense and troublesome.\n*  Chicken CocoaJoe was a bust.  Chicken a little dry and under-seasoned, rice and beans were bland (needs a giant ham-hock and about 3 more days).  The Plaintain was overflavored, but underseasoned (they don't neem much more than salt and time).\n\nAwesome location.\nMenu will expand I am sure.\nRepaint the bathroom please."

1,"Yes. It is slow. Yes. It is busy.......\n\nBut remember, it is a pharmacy that is OPEN.....\nALWAYS. Yes. That's right.... ALWAYS. 24/7. 365 a year. Keep that in mind.\n\nNot everyone gets sick during business hours.\nLike today, my 11 month old spiked a fever of 103, out of no where. After spending a trip to the emergency room across the street..... I found it convenient to drop off and pick up so close.\n\nThis was around 10pm. The pharmacy technician was working alone, and I could see that she had a line.... At least 6 deep. Make sure you push the \""call\"" button, or else they won't know you exist.\n\nShe set me up efficiently, and quickly. Told me it would be shit an hour.\n\nAt midnight, I come back. One car in front of me.... So, yes, always busy. There was another woman being helped inside, as well. \n\nFinally, it was my turn. All my questions were answered, the instructions that were given to me were clear.\n\nNo complaints, really. Slow , yes. Busy, yes.\n\nBut open, all the time...

0,"My daughter's cheer team stayed here for one night because that was about all we could take. Our girls are 6, 7 and 8 years old. There were all kinds of creepy people hanging out around the hotel along with a package of sex toys that one of our coaches happen to get a photo of.  One of our dad's was approached by one of the bartenders letting him know if he needed sexual services that he would be sure to get it there at Rumor. My cheer team was promised we could practice in the courtyard, but there was dog poop all over the place so that wasn't possible. Our cheer practice ended up being moved to an inside room, but the ceilings were short so we were unable to do our stunts. One of our moms had absolutely no hot water in her room to take a shower. the room I had was very dusty, missing a living room lamp, the sofa had black stains on it and had no throw pillows on the beds. The room literally had to be cleaned while we were in it. \n\nOverall it was HOTEL HELL. Nice try, but I can never do it again."
1,"This Festival will get its fair share of hateful reviews, but you know what? I like it. Not an \""I Like It and I Want To Go Every Year\"" kind of like, but more of an \""I Like It and Would Go Every Other Year\"" kind of like. It is great for people watching so you really don't have to spend a ton of money to have a good time. It's $10 to get in and if you don't get wasted or pig out then you can get by with spending only $20 inside. Yes, almost all of the vendors are over priced and the food can be rather pedestrian (too many chain restaurants for my liking), but you can find a few tent gems that are offering good food at a reasonable price. Yesterday I got a big $6 BBQ plate, $2 for two tacos, a big order of stromboli for $5, $2 mac n' cheese, and a $6 16oz. Coors Light.  Don't worry, I spread that out over about 6 hours (with a midday break at Patties for a few beers).\n\nOne big improvement this year is doing away with the tickets and switching over to a debit card for all of your food and drink purchases. Much easier. One bummer, it is the same tents year after year. It makes it kinda boring.\n\nTips on making it better:\nWhy not have a section for new restaurants at the Culinary Festival? Like a whole stretch of tents for all the first time restaurants appearing at the GAP. I don't know, I think this is a great idea if I may say so. And I know this sounds lame, but some of the prices at these tents are ridiculously high. Why set your prices so high at an event like this when you can possibly attract new customers to your actual restaurant. Seems like a bad business decision to me.  \n\nIt will always crack me up when I see girls dressed in club attire and six inch high heels for this event. Why?!? You are walking around a food festival and there is no way you are comfortable in that shit! Hysterical. Please don't change, Scottsdale!"
1,"You can't really beat a breakfast buffet for $5. I didn't eat lunch or dinner, so I can't comment. But the selections seemed good. They have Mexican, Asian, Pizza, etc.\n\nFor the breakfast, at $5, that's a bargain. And with all the choices, it was amazing. They have waffles, pancakes, and french toast and all the fixings (didn't see a sugar free option though). They have churros (and a pretty large selection of mexican options). Sausage, sauteed veggies and sausage, bacon, ham, chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy, spanish rice, beans, tortillas, hush puppies, chicken veggie soup, Chorizo and eggs, scarmbled eggs. They have fruit. One negative is their pastry selection is all donuts. But for $5, I can honestly overlook that as I was never a huge pastry person.\n\nThe biggest plus is they have made to order omelets, which is a winner in my book. \n\nA bargain for $5, in my opinion."
1,Excellent choice for a good dinner on their patio.  High on my list of patio restaurants.
0,"My husband and I each ordered an omelet with different fillings, his with side pancake and mine with hashbrowns and toast.  We also ordered an oven baked pancake to share since you can't go to a new restaurant and not try the signature item.  The omelets were small and flavorless.  The traditional pancake was nothing special (IHOP's are better). The hash browns were tasty.  The oven baked pancake was the best item by far, but still not outstanding.  The menu is very limited, which is not a problem, but if you have a small menu all your items should be excellent.  The restaurant is small, but doesn't feel cozy and warm.  It was eerily quiet and I could hear the wait staff complaining in the kitchen.  Unfortunately my first trip to JP pancake will be my last."
1,"So you waited until the last minute to get your college best friend a present for her birthday. Problem is: you don't see her very often, thus, you don't really know what she's into nowadays. You want to give her something that's unique and stylish and unusual, something that exudes \""Phoenix-chic,\"" something that you know she'll love because it's artsy. What do you do...what do you do?\n\nWell, you really ought to go to MADE art boutique on Roosevelt Row. The boutique houses artist-made gift items, like pottery, clothing, jewelry, bags, cards for all occasions, sculptures, books, and even chocolates! \n\nI received this really cool-looking necklace that has an antique poker chip that says \""bulldog\"" embellished with tiny crystals for a pendant.  It's such a conversation piece every time I wear it. I also purchased a very colorful purse made of gum wrappers that is just so perfect for spring!\n\nWhat makes this place even more special is that it hosts workshops in creative writing and in various forms of art. Very cool!\n\nRight next to eyelounge...check it out (especially that book \""Toilets of the World)!"

0,We went there tonight to eat dinner and my husbands meal came and we kept waiting on my food to come. I told him to go ahead and eat so his food wouldn't get cold. After 10 minutes I ask where my dinner was he said one minute and went to answer the phone. Meanwhile a whole family of 4 was served their meal while I continued to wait. My husband was finished eating by this time. So I ask for a to go box for his food. Then he brings out my food. I told him I didn't want it now we were leaving. He charged me for food I didn't get. He never apologized or anything! I will NEVER EVER GO BACK! I do not recommend this place at all. Bad service!!
1,"Stopped in for some brisket.  Had the dinner plate.  As usual, cut it with a plastic fork tender.  Just yummy.  I went with double mac and cheese as my 2 sides.  Theirs is a little different.  Has some onion and I suspect other spices in it and I love it.  And as I always do, I must mention the sauce.  Again, a little different than the usual here.  Love it again.\n\nAlso as usual, friendly and prompt service too.  Thanks again Bobbee."

1,"This review is for Great Arizona Picnic event of the Scottsdale Culinary Festival ... I want to key in on the word \""Picnic\"".   A lot of reviewers have complained about the food not be of culinary excellence, which is correct, but the selections are decent for a picnic.  There is broad range of mediocre, decent priced food from local restaurants, such as BBQ, taco stands, gelato, sushi, and even Indian Food.  Despite what some of the reviewer's state, there are several events throughout the week that are tailored towards the Foodies.   These events do cost more than $10 for admission, as do most extraordinary culinary events.   Now back to the picnic, it's a blast!  It's a perfect way to enjoy the spring while day drinking.   This year, they went away with tickets and instead you put money on the GAP card, and pay vendors with the card.   I believe the reason there is a no cash policy, is because a portion of the proceeds go to non-profit organizations. We spent a good amount of time in the beer garden.  On Sunday the price of admission into the garden was cut down to $10, and then each beer sample (4oz) is $1.  With a selection of over 200 beers, it was a great way to try all different kinds of beer from local breweries and vendors.  The rest of our day was spent lounging on the main picnic lawn enjoying the bands playing on the main stage.  To sum it up: Go to the AZ picnic if you want to hang out in the sun and enjoy some tasty beverages and mediocre food... Don't go to the picnic if you have less than $40 in your pocket, and expect to be delivered a culinary masterpiece."
1,"I was recommended to come here by Dre at Montelucia resort and am I happy I did.\n\nThe guac with cranberries was weird at first, then delicious! I really enjoyed the barrio pollo and pescado tacos; best chicken taco ever hands down.\n\nThe service was hands down the best- props to Nomas and Ivette!!"
0,"My boyfriend, brother, cousins and I spent NYE at Vegas and right before we headed back to the Bay, we wanted to bring DD back home. Upon entrance to the establishment, we were nicely greeted by a Caucasian male and the service was great. Midway through our order (we had about 7-8 dozens to bring back), the same person helping us was starting to be a prick! I understand that we are ordering a lot and he was not shy showing his annoyance. Its not like our orders were even complicated. He should be happy we brought business to them. When a coworker as him if he was doing OK, he shook his head. Really?! How hard is it to put donuts in boxes??!!! I was sooo pissed off I wanted to confront him but my bf said to just let it go since we most likely wont see him again. My excitement over DD dwindled after such service to the point that my first donut bite was nothing special. He ruined my moment. I hid my receipt somewhere and when I find it, I'm going to blast that rude server!"
0,Not this location specifically but the bank itself is crap. \n\nToday was supposed to be my billing date on my credit card. Went into a branch and they asked if I wanted to take all my money out of my checking account. Honestly how dumb can you get? Then the servers just happened to crash. I was told to call the number on the back of my card. I did just that. A few times. \n\nThe first guy did the same thing as when I was in the branch itself. Thought I wanted to take money out of my checking account. Seriously? Okay. Nope. Screw you too. I said I wanted them to take money from my checking account to pay my credit card bill. But that it was whatever now and hung up. I'm not wasting my time dealing with you and your crap when I have more important things to do. \n\nI call again and this guy tells me that to pay the bill over the phone there is a service fee. First thing I did was hang up. \n\nSeriously? A service fee to pay my freaking bill. That I've been trying to take care of for the last hour? Okay that makes no sense. \n\nSo now that I have discovered how truly horribly they are able to take care of their customers I'm really really planning on getting rid of any and all service I will ever have there. \n\nWhat is the point in trying to do what you need to when all they do I say is you have to pay this much more for us to do what you need to be done. Or that the only way we can help you is by making you jump through 200 different hoops. Nope. Screw all of you. I'm done.
1,"Hanged out here in May 2013.  Incredibly lush, amazing service and superbly clean! When money is no object this is the place to stay."
1,This is a nice BK.  The building has been remodeled and looks great.  The inside is pretty and looks very modern.  They have the usual seating as well as a little cove with couches and cushy seats to sit and have a coffee.  The playground area is nice and big.  It is 2 stories with a lot of room for the kiddos to run around in.  There is pretty limited seating for adults though with only 3 tables available.  Another bonus was the new automated soda machine.  I love these machines and the abundance of soda choices.  Yummy!  Overall it was a nice BK as compared to the others I have visited.
1,"Recent family lunch at the Duck, outside under the amazing eucalyptus trees, had more great sandwiches.  It's so easy to get a really layered and yummy vegetarian sandwich with great side treats.  And the meat-a-tarians in the family loved their sandwiches too!"
1,"Walking into the store you could already feel the friendly atmosphere the place offers. The frozen yogurt tasted great especially since they have my favorites taro and pistachio! This place is much better then the Eastern location. I definitely will be recommending this place to my work, friends, and family!"
0,"Called to place a carry out order and they said they couldn't take our order because they had \""a full house\"" and promptly hung up before we could ask anything else.\n\nHorrible customer service! Definitely won't be back here and won't be recommending them either."
1,The sandwich with eggs and bacon was amazing! I think the wait was too long and next time I will order to go but I will definitely stop by again!  They should put tables outside instead of having all of the seats for waiting outside!
1,"Very Professional ,Knowledgeable and Honest work!  Bathroom lights went out in both upstairs bathrooms.  I checked the main breaker all seemed in order.  Although not a critical failure, Brad responded the same day I called. he quickly diagnosed the problem and the lights were back on!  \n\nBrad provided a free estimate and reasonable rates, and took the time to explain the problem."
1,"What you've heard is true!! Amazing salads and pizzas. The staff seems so happy to work there and be hands on. They take great pride in the food themselves :). Loved that I could build my own pizza with dozens of topping choices, including the meats and cheeses ! This is the place for me! I love different types of salami, chicken and sausages...there's no \""typical\"" only offered here!  Delicious :)"
0,"it was bad all around. we requested a two bed room at reservation time but got a one bed room when we got there even though they had that request on file.\n\nthen the next morning when I needed a meeting/business room first the receptionist said all rooms were under construction. when I insisted, the receptionist had to go check with manager?!\n\nthe manager comes out and says rooms are all taken (not under construction anymore but taken) but she could give me another stay room for half rate to use for a one hour meeting! I declined and decided to use the lobby area for my business phone call (mind you it was a phone interview with a morning radio show!).\n\nShe was now suspicious that I was not a hotel guest and really came in attack mode to not allow me use the lobby area. It wasn't until I told her that first thing I will do after I get off the phone is writing a horrible review for the hotel that she learned how to be polite and smile!\n\nMontreal is a beautiful city with great Hotels. Don't waste your time in this one."
1,"This is a rather large city of henderson park. There are two playgrounds here, lots of grass, large old trees (hard to find in the desert!), bathrooms, covered picnic areas, a huge ballpark with stadium seating, a skate park, and horseshoes. I like to bring my kids here with a picnic lunch and let them play onthe playground. Theres pigeons galore, and theyll steal your food if you leave it unguarded, so beware! usually the parks empty, which i like. Its big and well-kept. 4 stars it is."
1,"Marathon training season is in full swing, and I couldn't let a little detail like being away from Chicago get in the way of my Sunday long run. My friends recco'ed this park because it's right near where they live, and it has a path for runners/joggers/dogwalkers.\n\nBefore I get into my review of the park itself, I have a serious question for Phoenix runners: HOW DO YOU DO IT? I went for an early morning run, thinking I'd beat the heat, and spent less time in my \""zone\"" and more time looking for water fountains. Seriously, I have deep, deep respect for those of you who run in that heat on a regular basis. \n\nThe great thing about this park is that there are PLENTY of water fountains. I was very happy to discover that water can be found at least every 1/8 mile, and sometimes more frequently. The fountains attached to buildings (the park office, etc.) have really cold water, too. Love.\n\nAn extra bonus about the park is that there are a couple of hills. I've been craving some hill workouts recently because Chicago is super flat, and there are these two giant mounds in the middle of the park (near the playground area) which are just perfect for those. One side of each hill has stairs built into the grass, which means extra variety.\n\nI obviously went for my run sans dog, but I think this would be a perfect spot to let your best friend run around. There's a small-dog area, lots of twisty paths, and much grass for doggies to roll around on. The early morning dogwalkers I ran into seemed very friendly and nice."
0,"So I love Serranos and when I come to AZ to visit family I usually always eat there once. On this particular trip my family wanted brunch instead of dinner so I suggested Brunchies. Terrible call. \n\nWe were seated at a table and helped by an elderly woman who seemed nice enough. 5 minutes in we have no water, silver wear, or our order taken. 10 minutes in we finally place our order. 30 minutes in we still have not received our food or the basket of sugar chips (which are good) even though people around us who arrived later have all got theirs. I ask for an update and I'm told the food will be right out. \n\n10 minutes later I ask again and they say its only two minutes away but at this point we are going to be late for a wedding I have to attend and can't wait any longer. We leave having eaten nothing. \n\nI've worked in th restaurant industry a long time and can say this experience ranks near the top of my worst ever list. Usually if an order is taking too long someone made a mistake, which is fine when a manager explains the hold up and often times even offers a free appetizer or something while you wait. It was over 40 minutes from the time we ordered until we left and not once die we receive an apology, explanation, or just an update from our server or a manager. I will never recommend Brunchies to anyone."
1,"Upgraded to the red room premier and was glad I did.  The room was super cute, very clean and the bathroom was huge.  The view was the best feature - looked right over the Bellagio fountains and the pool.  However...don't go to this hotel if you want a nice pool.  The pool is very boring by Las Vegas standards.  And it closes really early - 6PM.  Other than that, a very nice, reasonably priced hotel on the strip."
0,"I live in the Bay Area and eat a lot of Chinese food, so maybe I'm biased but I thought Pearl was really disappointing. My fiancee and I spent over $300 and the food was just not great. We ordered the Chef Yau's Tasting Menu. The spide prawn dumplings were the best thing we had. The minced chicken in lettuce cups was bland. The spare rib was really tough. The chowder was also bland. I expected a better cut of meat with the XO sauce and the stir fried vegetables came out of the kitchen cold. It was pretty basic Chinese, nothing advanced or inventive and it was sloppily executed. I would recommend you spend little more and go to craftsteak or Joel Robuchon."
1,"gestern habe ich nach den empfehlungen auch mal dieses kleinod aufgesucht. und ich darf sagen: k\u00f6nnte mein neues lieblingsrestaurant werden. die speisenauswahl ist angenehm klein und sehr fein. viel regionales und saisonales, das erfreut mein herz.\nich hatte das dreigangmen\u00fc, bestehend aus einem wels-curry mit muskatk\u00fcrbis, b\u00e4llchen vom \u00fcberl\u00e4ufer (1-2j\u00e4hriges schwein) samt serviettenkn\u00f6del und preiselbeerbirne gefolgt von einem lauwarmen schokoladenkuchen. \ndas ganze f\u00fcr absolut angemessene 26 euro, ich h\u00e4tte sogar mehr gezahlt, da alles perfekt gegart war, geschmackvoll kombiniert und professionell serviert wurde. meine begleitung hatte sogar einen gang mehr, das viergangmen\u00fc f\u00fcr 39 tacken. auch hier ein querschnitt aus raffinierten aber nicht verk\u00fcnstelten rezepten in harmonischer abfolge. \neingeleitet wurde das essen von einem kleinen gru\u00df aus der k\u00fcche. durch die \u00fcberschaubarkeit des gastraums wirkt die olive gem\u00fctlich, ohne dabei bieder oder eng zu sein. ein gutes raumkonzept schafft eine angenehme atmosph\u00e4re. \nzum essen gab es wasser und zwei verschiedene weine (rot /wei\u00df), die, obwohl offen, eine erfreulich hohe qualit\u00e4t zeigten. zum abschluss noch einen guten kaffee  dann nach pers\u00f6nlicher verabschiedung bestens verk\u00f6stigt und inspiriert nach hause gelaufen. \njederzeit wieder, uneingeschr\u00e4nkte empfehlung."
0,"Even though I'm a local, with two major locals' casinos near home, the casino at MGM Grand has become my casino of choice, ever since I discovered that MGM is the only brand that actually rewards its players, even us little ones.  I'm now usually there once a week, on Ladies Night Out with my other poker widow friends, but I'm not a high roller by any means.  My measly few bucks has translated into generous food comps, so I now spend my gambling dough there, instead of Suncoast (best comp: a free ice cream cone) or Rampart at the Marriott (never even so much as a key chain).\n\nThat usually means we're eating at Studio Cafe, and the result can be great or totally disastrous, depending on which chef showed up that night.  Since the bad times have outweighed the good ones, it's two stars instead of three.  But tonight the good chef clocked in.\n\nMy friend and I shared a Reuben, and it was perfectly grilled.  The corned beef was moist and not overly fatty, and the amount of dressing was just right.  The Reuben is usually a good bet, though once in a while, when the B Team is in place, it will have to be sent back to actually get grilled instead of just toasted.\n\nMy friend wanted fries, but I wanted to try to salvage an otherwise ghastly week of overindulgence - I wanted fruit.  We solved the problem by getting the fries and ordering a side of fruit.\n\nThe fries, as others have probably indicated, are served in a miniature version of a fryer basket.  Tonight they were fresh, hot, and crisp, but that's not always the case here.  The fruit cup side order consisted of exactly 10 pieces (two each) of cantaloup, honeydew, watermelon, pineapple, and strawberry slices.  The waitress must have told the kitchen we were sharing, and I chuckled as I divvied up the portion, imagining someone in the back counting out each piece and making sure it was exactly equal and divisible by two.\n\nWe each had coffee, one regular and one decaf.  I'm the one writing this review at 1:00 a.m., so guess which one I had!  I'm a Starbucks junkie, so I don't rate the coffee too highly.  It's barely passable, IMHO, but others may disagree. [Note: Starbucks is right next to the Cafe].\n\nGloria was our waitress tonight; she's served us before, and she's efficient and businesslike.  \n\nThe one consistent Five-Star performer at Studio Cafe is the bread that's served in a basket with meals.  It is absolutely OUTSTANDING, and I can't find bread this good anywhere else in Vegas - not in restaurants, bakeries, or supermarkets.  It's a dense, whole-grain bread covered with a fantastic New York, Eli's or Zabar's-like crispy crust.  It's the kind of stuff I'd be bringing back from the East Coast if the airlines hadn't started gouging us for checked baggage. The bread alone is worth the price of admission.  And if they ever decide to save money by changing that bread, I won't ever go back.  I'm not kidding.  It's that good.\n\nSpeaking of prices, they are - ta-da - way, way too high for what is essentially a coffee shop.  Sandwiches are around $15-16.  But if you're a tourist staying on the Strip, and want sit-down service that's a notch above the nearby Denny's, and more choices than the McDonald's in MGM's  miserable excuse for a food court, then you can give Studio Cafe a try.  And hope that the A-Team is working."
0,Good for price.
1,"A sweet little Italian place that shouldn't have been difficult to find but turned out to be an adventure.  If you're on your smart phone, don't auto click for directions.  Copy and input the address to your map app. to find this place.  Trust me, you don't want to be doing a tour of the timeshare homes of Arizona.   \n\nLots of varieties of creamy gelatos; perfect for an after meal dessert.  The fruit gelatos were sweet and refreshing - they certainly have a wide range of fruity flavors for you to choose from.  The chocolates and dessert based gelatos are heavier on the tongue and would go lovely with a smokey cup of espresso, which they serve right in the shop.  Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area."
0,"EW. Horrible horrible horrible service. I very rarely leave no tip, but this place got none. Especially in times as hard as these, I sympathize with the staff...but we got absolutely NO help here.\n\nGood chips and dip though."
1,"I've learned that expectations can really effect your experience in pretty much any dining situation. Lenny's, for example, is an unassuming burger shack. It's tiny, clean, but really just unremarkable to look at. I was hungry for a burger, having had far too healthy of a breakfast and lunch. I didn't hate myself enough to go to the big \""royal\"" burger chain across the street, so into Lenny's I went.\n\nI forget the name of the burger I ordered. It may have been the Mexican burger, as it was topped with green chilli. That, and some onion rings, and I'm ready to go. A short wait later and there is a very pretty burger sitting in front of me. A toasted sesame bun. A hearty slab of very tasty beef. And these wondrously spicy and sweet green chilli. I was simply unprepared for a burger of this caliber to come from such a humble place. To top it all off, the onion rings were, in a word: perfect. I have never had such perfectly fried and battered rings. The onion was cut generously enough to still taste, but didn't get pulled out of it's fried shell in a single bite. Absolute heaven. \n\nDon't judge a book by it's cover, I've been told. Nor should you judge a restaurant because it's small and tucked into a shopping plaza. \n\nThe book thing sounds better though."
1,I like the convenience of this store. They do have an instant key center. The prices seem to be better than most other Lowes. They do however honor Veteran's discounts and the employees are more apt to help you here.
0,I have never been more disappointent with a company in my life! It took me 4 months of calling Customer Service and going into the store to get my phone issues fixed. I'm talking about something as simple as being able to access my voicemail. I finally had to travel 30 miles away to a DSC store where finally after what seemed to be 27 employees later I am now able to retrieve my voicemail and send a text message! I would NEVER recogmend AT&T to anyone and I dream of the day my contract is up. I would rather pay a higher bill with Verizonthan deal with the incompetence of the employees and lack of Customer Service!
1,"This place has been around for years and I have to admit that the quality of the food has remained very consistent.  It's a small place in a little strip mall, they have about 6 maybe 7 tables.  Most people come here for take out.  The food is very reasonably priced and you get a ton of it.  I've never been able to finish a portion in less than 2 days.  My favorite is the 6 fried chicken wings (all drumettes), if I remember correctly this cost about $3.75.\n\nThey offer all of your typical American Chinese fare, which we all know is chicken cooked 275 ways and then beef and pork cooked those same 275 ways :)  If you're looking for a more healthy option, try one of the steamed veggie/fish dishes and substitute the fried rice for steamed rice."
1,"I live in North Scottsdale and it's worth driving all the way down here. Dr Oswald is excellent, as is the whole staff. Scheduling/billing and everything else is a breeze. They've taken care of some things that my previous dentists have let slide. I've gotten a couple of onlays and filling replacements that are working out much better. Highly recommended!"
1,"Froyo makes me happy. I haven't been to many places, so I can't really compare Yogurtology to the other local spots. As most reviewers have said, this place is clean. They are always out with the mini vacuum sucking up the spilled toppings. We've been here a few times. Both when the place was empty and when crowded. But it seems to move quickly and there's never a long wait. I usually choose the sweet yogurts because the selections sound so good, but every time I realize that I do like the tart flavors better. There is always a No Sugar Added selection, which is a plus. The raspberry is awesome! The toppings bar has a great selection. I even witnessed another customer ask for something that was not out, and the employee went into the back room and brought out a cup of the topping for her. I especially like the MAYO!  The staff has always been friendly, greeting guests as they walk in and offering samples if desired. It can be a little pricey, compared to other shops I've seen, but for the convenience, quality, and once-in-a-while treat, it's well worth it."
0,"I really wanted to get grub at Price's, but they don't have a dining area and I didn't want to get take out.\n\nCame here for lunch.  Waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved.  Free cornbread was average.   I had the fried chicken and sides of mashed potatoes and mac n' cheese.  Surprisingly, none of it was really that good.  Service was cheerful though.\n\nI guess the best part was I was able to park in downtown Charlotte, found a free spot, and wasn't towed when I was done eating here."
1,Really nice and fun decor. Waiter was great. Gnocchi appetizers was delicious. Had lunch sandwich and it's was very filling. Looking forward to going back!
1,"The wait to check out was a bummer. More lanes should have been opened to accommodate the amount of people and carts waiting, minus a star. Otherwise, this location is one of the better ones around. The store is very clean, bright, and well organized. It gives off a \""higher end\"" appeal, but with the awesome Target prices. I did see a Starbucks along with other food options to grab a quick snack. I took my niece to the bathroom and was impressed on how spotless it was! Kudos to this location!"
0,"False advertising on Travelocity. You will not get the newly remodeled rooms they show you on Travelocity. The pool chairs are disgusting. The two Yvonne's at the front desk are not very friendly at all. The food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about. No refrigerator and the bed hurt my back. Not sure how this place is still in business. I will NEVER stay here again. Not worth the drive, just stay in downtown Scottsdale or Talking Stick. \n\nThe two stars is for the hotel staff (not the front desk people) and the beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains."
0,"cool place, food was ok... not great not terrible. Mussells were bland, despite the waitress doing a great job explaining how they are prepared... that cool egg , wrapped in meat and deep fried was fun, different and the mustard sauce was special.. we are a larger group so tried a lot... pretzel sticks were tasty.. service fair.. almost got 3 stars but not quite, and i would not rush back...."
0,Over priced and under filling. A $9 salad shouldn't be 95% lettuce. Save your money for somewhere else. Their saving grace is the beer.
1,"I was one of the unlucky Phoenicians to experience a long-term power outage as a result of the monsoons, so I needed to take my pooch somewhere to cool off. It just so happened that I remembered Wag N Wash as my list of places to visit.\n\nFirst of all, a lot of businesses on the 7th ave strip can be hard to get to and find. Wag N Wash was really easy to spot and I had no problem getting into the parking lot.\n\nWhen we entered, the guys up front were really nice. I decided to get Penny's nails clipped and they took me back and I did not even have to wait. The clipping was $5 and went quick and smooth. No blood :) Boy, it is SO much easier to have someone around to help with nail clippings.\n\nI walked around to look at their selection and was extremely impressed. They had bag and canned foods of all varieties as well as a refrigerator with raw meats and pre-made foods. \n\nAnother neat feature was a huge samples table. I have been wanting to try the Wellness brand for a while, and was able to take a pre-packaged sample home to try out. \n\nThe owners were extremely knowledgeable about the products and able to make some suggestions about foods for a puppy.\n\nThey also had a good selection of pet toys.\n\nI was most impressed with the \""bakery\"" they have up front. They had a variety of homemade dog treats that I could not pass up. They smelled so good I wanted to eat them. Penny is too small to eat the treats unless I break them up into little pieces, but she absolutely loved them.\n\nI was also excited to be added to the discount club. \n\nOverall Wag N Wash was a really good experience and I will definitely be back!"
0,"What a disappointment.  We've passed by Max Brenner several times when shopping in the Forum Shops and the restaurant looks very inviting.  We read the great reviews on yelp and finally decided to take the rug rats for a late night bite & dessert.\n\nIf Yelp had separate ratings for service, Max Brenner would get a big ZERO.  Before I begin, I must note that we went on a Monday evening and it was not very busy.\n\n1. It took close to 10 minutes after getting seated until somebody came to our table. \n2. Orders came out wrong.  (A salad was ordered half-dressed with dressing on the side but it came out wrong.  Coffee came out cold.  Mojitos came out with very little mint.)\n3. We had two young kids (2 & 7) and usually restaurants will bring their drinks in kids cups (or covered cups), but the server didn't have the insight to do that for us.  Perhaps this isn't bad service...but I certainly appreciate servers who can anticipate your specific needs.\n4. Halfway thru dinner...a server drops our check on our table.  Wow...anxious to close the restaurant???\n\nNow the food was just okay, but that's not the reason to come to Max Brenner.  Pizza was marginally better than frozen.  Salads were a bit soggy.\n\nThe desserts were presented very well and pretty tasty, but not enough to return to this restaurant.  Too bad."
1,I normally HATE chain places and is never eat at Red Lobster but a friend went and got married at the court house and had his wedding dinner there so I had no choice.  I studied the menu and just hit the coconut shrimp with the seafood Alfredo!  It was so good I've been back three times this month.  Very fresh.  Free cheddar biscuits and a great salad with chunky blue cheese not all just ice burg lettuce!  Very fresh and hot!  Service was good too!  Servers seemed happy not just like they were tolerating being there!  GREAT parking lot!  And it's right off highway!
0,The only good thing I can say is the place looks nice. Other than that it is a complete train wreck. The service was really bad. We had one drink which took about 10 minutes to get after we ordered. They didn't have the first two beers I ordered. I chose them off the tap handles?  They finally brought some chips and salsa. Three different servers tried to bring us food that we didn't order. I could go on and on but not worth it. For their sake I hope they get it fixed or they will surely meet an early demise.
1,"I remember the first time going into the Elephant Bar and thinking the has to extensive a menu.  For me that is usually a sign that overall the food is not going to be consisten, just to much  of a variety.  My compliments to the chef, I have never had anything that hasn't been quite good.  That is saying something as I over all over the menu.  My dining companion has looked at what at my entree more than once and said \""you are going to eat that?\""  The ambience of the Elephant Bar is rather nice as well.  Not that you don't see the cutoffs and flip flop crowd but it is some place that one can enjoy dressing a bit for a nicer casual dinner.  \n\nThe only drawback of the Elephant Bar is the service.  As a whole it is usually very good but occasionally you do get a zinger.  To the management's credit, those people usually don't last."
1,"Can people from an Eastern European country with less of a population than NC make a decent pizza?  The answer is a surprising yes.  We had wanted to try this place for a while, and a certificate from http://halfoffdepot.com/charlotte/referafriend/?bl=YmZpcm1zdG9uZUB5YWhvby5jb20=   persuaded us.  We were going to see a show uptown so we decided this would be a good time to use it.  It should be noted that although this place is on East 10th Street, it is more on the edge of Plaza Midwood than uptown.  Don't plan on walking or taking the light rail to get here as it's on the corner of Central Ave .It's a unique, clean but rustic place that boasted a sanitation score of 101 points.  They also deliver now so it is a little odd to see delivery personnel going in and out of the place.\n\nWhen we arrived we were seated promptly and our drink orders taken quickly.  They have a decent amount of craft beer, including Highland Gaelic and Fat Tire, available in 20 ounce mugs or honest 16 ounce pints.  Our service was a little slow as far as order taking as our waiter seemed to be doubling as a bartender.  We ordered garlic bread for an appetizer (they are half off until 7pm) and it was delicious.  Two long, soft, fluffy sticks served with homemade sauce.  The significant other ordered the tuna special which seemed more Dominican than Serbian but it was good.  It was rare tuna served with crisp plantains, beans and rice.  I ordered pizza with beef on half but they didn't but beef on any of it so they get dinged for that.  The pizza, however, was very good.  The sauce was very fresh as were the cheese and toppings.  The density was somewhere between thin and thick which can be as hard to find in Charlotte as a native Charlottean :)\n\nI would definitely go back to Intermezzo and try some of the Serbian dishes, but for now they get 4 stars due to the relative slow service and getting my order slightly incorrect."
0,"If I could give this place no stars I would. Only if I could save people from ever living here I would too.\n\nOver the top pricy!!!!!! I pay almost $1,200 a month and I'm already getting a concession! I beat myself in the head everytime I think I could be paying a mortage on a home than to live in this awful apartments!\n\nTheir security is horrible! Trying to find a parking space at your own home is impossible, it's easier to build a helicopter pad and flying in than ever finding a parking spot that isn't 10 miles away. They don't have assign parking even though THEY SHOULD!\n\nThey advertise their amenities like it's a luxirious place but it's not! Their 24 hr gym is only open during bussines hours. Their fancy computer room is full of old slow computer monitors who's internet blows! There is no Wii Fit in the gym because it got stolen! You can't even change the TV channels in the gym or common areas because low life garbage live there and they can't seem to stop stealing!!!\n\nThe walls are thin so good luck having to hear your neighboor every night for the rest of your lease! The pools look phenomenal in pictures though. Pool areas are always packed with parties full of people that don't even live there and you never get to enjoy what you pay for.\n\nOh by the way, did I forget to mention that the staff is rude and not ever helpful? You'd think they being forced to work! The office never picks up their calls and you always get sent to an offsite answering place that can never seem to answer your questions or ever solve your problems.\n\nNever mind paying more to live across from the pretty pool view. You will be stuck with parties and loud music playing from 7am in the morning to whatever time you decide to call the cops because the considerate staff forgets to shut off the radios! How nice of them to have to try to sleep while you are lisenting to Lady GAGA?\n\nThe bbq pits are disgusting! I would never recommend anyone cooking on them unless you clean them and sanatize them yourself because I saw them clean it with a mop once and dirty water! \n\nThe place is infested with roaches, they supposly have an exterminator schedule but I never see them come around and I see the ground shift when I walk to my car in the parking lot from all the roaches that are out there crawling the walls. Be very careful they don't come in your house or they will lay eggs. Thankfully my house is a death row sentence for these nasty animals.\n\nI can't wait until my lease ends, worst life decision I have ever made!!!!"
0,"Horrible!  We waited for over an hour for 3 gluten free fried rice dishes and one other dish.  Finally had to ask to see the manager.  He was stunned we were waiting. Many, many other tables had come and gone.  Our waitress never once came to our table to talk about the wait.  The manager then claimed it was because we had gluten free.  We eat at PF Changs often. This was not a gluten free - takes an hour issue.  It was a bad waitress and cook staff issue!  Will not go back to this location ever!"
1,"Loudons has everything you want from a cafe/coffee shop:\n\n- Good coffee (Gotta love it when a place makes a heart out of your cappuccino foam. How fancy!)\n\n- Delicious lunch\n\n- Friendly staff\n\n- Tons of cute babies to make funny faces at (Seriously, I challenge you to go to Loudons and NOT see at least one cute baby. It won't happen.).\n\n- (and best of all) Free, FAST,  Wi-Fi. \n\nMy best friend and I sit in there all day, drinking coffee and working on our laptops. When we're feeling flush (aka when we're not feeling dirt poor) we splurge for a pesto, mozzarella sandwich or a quiche to split for lunch. The food is really tasty!!\n\nWell done, Loudons."
1,"Went here for my birthday and had a blast!! No VIP red carpet BS you'd put up with at snooty clubs. Good mixed crowd, no drama, great music! Only reason I won't give it five stars is because it was hotter than fire and brimstone in there and security made me put my hand fan away! WTF?! Other than that it was fantastic!"
0,They charged me $1275 for a part that retails for $600.  And why am I thinking it was a used part at that?
0,"Eh...If in Tempe, go to Khai Hoan for Vietnamese. The only thing this place has is it's late night hours (open until 2a on weekend)."
0,"Very disappointed! If I had reviewed this before I'm sure they would of gotten 5 stars but after tonight's visit they deserve only 1 for overall service. I used to be quite a regular here, so much that the waitress already knew what I was going to order and she welcome me with a glass of lilikoi as I walked thru the door. \n\nToday's visit was quite the contrary; as I walked thru the door the older lady turned her back to us but I simply went straight to an open table. A few minutes passed as we waited and another couple walked in thru the door, the older lady was delivering food to a table and she stood there to have a 6 minute conversation with the table (I was looking at my watch) not giving any aloha's that we were going on almost a 15 minute wait and that there was customers standing at the entrance. \n\nAfter the long conversation, the older lady decided to sit down the couple and hand them some menus. My mom had to get up and ask the older lady for some menus after she sat back down the phone rang and she totally forgot about us. The younger waitress that's always there came out from the back and I calmly asked her for menus for a second time - let me just state that there was only two other tables that were already eating, the place was not packed for such lack of customer service! - still no menus came! The older lady walked to the back twice more and brought the table next to us a to go box and even decided to take the couple's order that had walked in after us. \n\nFinally! She decided to bring us the menus. I ordered a lilikoi and my mom a sprite, the older lady looked at my mom like she was dumb! She turned to me and tapped my menu with her hand and asked what my mom had said like she was non existent and she didn't know what Sprite is AND to tap my menu as I was reading demanding to know what she wanted!!! How freaking rude??? Apparently, they don't carry Sprite but Sierra Mist. Either way she could of said that, my mom looked at her like ok? where are your drinks on the menu? She snatched the menu off my mom's hand and turned it to the back but that menu was missing the back page! She didn't even apologize! \n\nMy blood was boiling at this point. I opened the menu and realized that the ahi poke I'm a regular for is now $18 from the $8.95 it used to be! If you can't afford an item on the menu, take it off don't double the price. The price was modified with a piece of tape. I about had it so I grabbed my keys and we walked out the door made me lose my appetite!"
1,Koi is an excellent dining option.  We had a group for business there.\n\nGreat fish and atmosphere.  Kobe Beef Potstickers are unbelievable.
1,"This really is a luxury hotel and the decor takes Vegas to a new level.. one that is less gawdy and tacky...  the decor is more modern and yet extremely whimsical.. take a tour, even if you are not staying at the hotel..  make it a point to do a walk through and stop at Parasol Up/Down for a drink..  Daniel Bouloud for a meal... or just enjoy the general casino area..  \n\nThe rooms are sweet.."
1,"Since there is only one here in Las Vegas, you have to plan ahead to dine here. The lines to dine here are usually long but the food makes it worth while waiting.  The staff that work here are very assertive and friendly.  Server named Irene is a joy to be reckoned with, her killer smile and professionalism makes me want to come back.  I recommend anyone to come dine here, just plan ahead before coming"
1,"Do My Nails is a great, fun place to get a good pedicure and manicure. I go every two weeks and the staff remembers you by name after your first visit. They are fun, energetic, and they do excellent work. The salon has plenty of pedicure seats with massage options and they are clean and efficient. I would highly recommend this salon to anyone."
1,Neat discovery!  Adorable and unique clothes and lots of Michael Stars tops.  They also have a lot of very reasonably priced cute jewelry.  The name is pretty misleading because the clothing they sell is really not exercise wear it is more for being out and about.  The woman who works here was very nice too.
0,I don't know how people think this place is even slightly ok....we went here based on all the yelpers good ratings and was so disappointed.  I didn't care so much that the restaurant is ugly.  I'll take an ugly restaurant as long as the food is tasty and authentic.  But the thai curry we ordered was watered down and not very flavorful.  My daughter's wonton soup was awful.  I'm sorry the people were nice but the food was bad.
1,I trusted my fellow Yelpers and stopped here for lunch as I traveled North.  I had a great brisket sandwich.  They told me that the meat was put in the smoker at 9 pm the prior night and it indeed was slow roasted perfection over a wood fire.  They have a great BBQ sauce that complimented the meat. They know their BBQ here!
1,"I give Park Place about 3.75 stars.  Park Place Restaurant is a Greek diner that is on Park Road almost out to 51.  It is located in what used to be Courtney's.  The inside of the restaurant is very large and even when there is a good crowd plenty of tables are normally available.  I actually think they might run out of parking before they ran out seating inside.  Much like the Landmark (a Greek diner on the East side of town Park Place reminds me of) the menu is large with many options. Also much like the Landmark, I am not sure how often some of the items on the menu get ordered.  I normally stick with the Park Place salad which is essentially a chef's salad with a grilled chicken breast instead turkey or ham.  I have tried the Reuben sandwich and a few breakfast items also and all were good.  I did have some broiled fish there once, but that wasn't quite on par with the other items I have had there.  The wait staff has always been good and the restaurant has always been clean so that is a positive.  Normally Park Place is someplace I go for lunch when work is slow and read the paper and eat a leisurely meal.  As I said previously if you have been to the Landmark this pretty much the same idea in Pineville and I would put it as one of the better Greek diners in town.  I have never tried the desserts, but I am guessing the Landmark has them beat there which is no mark against Park Place.  The crowd at Park Place is normally pretty diverse and it seems like a place a wide section of people seem comfortable.  I think the spaced out seating helps with this and the fact that you can have a cup of coffee without feeling rushed or crowded is part of the attraction to me."
0,"Was in Vegas for Memorial Day weekend and after seeing endless advertisements for the bets buffet in town - I was persuaded to try Wicked Spoon on my last day.  One of the things on my to-do list was a champagne brunch, so this seemed fitting before my departure.\n\nIt was a bit of a shock that brunch with drinks was $48 a person, but I told myself it would be worth it for the best buffet in town.\n\nThis was my first and last visit to 2 Wicked Spoon.  We sat down and waited a few minutes to order champagne before heading up for our breakfast round of brunch.  Personally, I enjoy eggs at brunch, the only eggs to be had were if you waited in the omelette line, so I did - for 15 minutes.  I returned to our table to find my boyfriend being reseated.  When I asked why he pointed to the right side of his body covered in coffee - yep that's right the waiter tripped and spilled coffee all over him. I told the waiter how disappointed I was and he got his manager - all she could offer us was a $40 gift certificate to the Hotel.  She also didn't seem too concerned with our dissatisfaction.  \n\nThe food was also disappointing, they were running out of items left and right.  I really wanted to try the tri trip, I was offered the leftover fatty scraps, but I opted to wait the 15 minutes for a fresh piece of meat.  I was also excited to see Mac 'n cheese, I love the stuff, however this Mac n cheese I was thoroughly disappointed with.  It was bland and a bit cold - ick!\n\nAll around, subpar food, crappy service and too high of a price point."
0,"Is this even sushi? I went there since my friend at work raved about how good their sushi is. I thought this place was probably the worst sushi I have had in a long time. The prices were pretty high and their food quality is sub par at best. I had their all you can eat dinner special at $24.95. I had their paradise roll, mountain roll and daves roll. I wasn't that bad but I definitely had way better. If these were their best rolls then I have to say I will not be back there ever again. The only good thing about their sushi is that they don't give you a ton of rice with their nigiri, however, their fish quality is horrid compared to other all you can eat places. Their tuna nigiri was warm and pink!? I thought that was really weird. I don't like this place. They really need a make over and a design consultant to revamp this sad restaurant. It is a waste of time and money. Do not go here."
0,"Some of the reviews seem dated and it appears the show may have changed up a little since changing venues over the past few years. I just stopped in this week at the Sakes Theater in Planet Hollywood (a bit of a trek past the V theater). It was a 4pm show and it was not very crowded. Theater is small but at least a GA ticket seat still was pretty decent.\n\nFull disclosure - I did get in at a discounted price so can't complain too much. Still, the review is based on the show, regardless of price paid. Since I had a GA ticket, I waited in the long line around the corner as other reviewers had mentioned.It didnt really bother me as the line was not all that long. I also did not see any pre-show like some reviewers mentioned. The first thing I saw upon entering (and getting my photo taken) was the AGT video clip from Nathan's days on AGT. My comment has less to do with showing the video clip but the poor quality of the video and the screen that is way up near the rafters. It is a small screen and the quality looked like a film clip from the 50's. Really in this day and age with a 16:9 aspect ratio, Ultra4HD quality video, that first impression was an omen of things to come. The sound was bad, the video horrendous and quite frankly seeing the hoff and brandy as judges just reminds us how long ago that he was on the show. Plus when you consider that the magicians/illusionist on the most recent season blows away Nathan's act, well...\n\nThe tricks alluded in other reviews like the disappearing acts are accurate. Not too impressive. Music makes it up tempo so I didnt fall asleep but it doesnt mean I was wow'ed. In fact that is what I would categorize the show -- it is missing any kind of \""wow factor\"". He also did the typical prediction in the locked box trick that copperfield does as well. I wasn't impressed with that either. I wish all magicians would just get rid of that old and dated trick.\n\nThe show also included the comedian with the masks tricks and making them do these embarrassing things and popping a balloon.  Again not a magic show and it does kill alot of time along with the upfront video so yeah, this show doesnt come close to an hour long.\n\nYou are handed a card at the end of the show to review them on tripadvisor but I wonder if Nathan or anyone else takes these comments constructively and make appropriate changes to make the show better. With the discounted tickets and small audiences I wonder how much longer this show can last. Moving from theater to theater is already indicative that it has no staying power. If you can get a cheap ticket and need time to kill, take a chance but dont expect to be wow'd. Not the worse but definitely could be improved. I will check back to see if future reviewers indicate whether the show has changed for the better."
1,"Great locally owned breakfast joint. Food is thoughtful and staff is friendly and helpful. Not only was the owner interacting with customers to see how everyone was doing, he was also bussing tables! Coffee an OJ prices were a bit steep. They won't keep us away but might be enough to prevent some people from returning."
1,"Its ok. Its an airport, and a stereotypical one at that. It has long lines and a lot of traffic, expensive chain restaurants, and shops. Nothing special. Customer Service is passable and they do a good job as expected, however it is a typical airport. No muss or fuss."
0,"This place is depressing. They certainly do not live up to their name. And I'm willing to look past that (well, maybe not) but there was just no energy in this place. I twas a Thursday night, and the casino area was dead. It was worse than casinos in Reno. The only reason we came here is because we were staying at the Tropicana and wanted a change. \n\nThe only reason we stayed was because we were hungry and wanted a cheap dinner...wings. We got an assortment of wings, and they were just okay. The waitress was nice, but completely forgettable. It was one of our friend's bday, and all the waitresses were about to sing, but the \""main\"" waitress forgot the song, so they had to go back, teach her, and they came back 20 minutes later. Really??\n\nWe went to a bar which, again on a Thu night, had maybe 10 people in it. And we roll in with our group of 8 and pretty much take over. Again, no fault of the bartender, as he was cool, but the vibe is just sad. \n\nWhen there are so many choices on the strip, I don't think you need to bother with this one."
0,"My wife had a buy one, get one coupon in recognition of her birthday so she ordered a full rack of baby back ribs while I ordered pork shoulder.   The ribs were overdone and the pork shoulder lacked flavor.  The sides were hit and miss:  potato salad (too much mayo), baked beans (excellent) and mac and cheese (fair). We are going to take a pass on this offer in the future"
0,I heard that Smashboxx is the new it bar in Scottsdale and I really wanted to see what all the buzz was about. There is nothing special about this club it looks like a sports bar with a dance floor. Smashboxx is the new place to see and be seen but I'd rather go somewhere that has a better atmosphere.
0,"Usually I don't publically comment on other people's food, but I stopped in at Two Hippies on 7th avenue for breakfast and it was awful.  \n\nI ordered the Hot Jam because it sounded interesting.\n\nSeriously... one doesn't serve a sandwich that's burnt on one side (and I mean black char burnt and they served it burnt side down so you didn't see it until you picked it up) to a guest unless you're just freakin lazy and don't care about the quality of your food. \n\nThe description also didn't match the sandwich. Not one sliver of coconut to be found.\n\nAnd what's with all of the grease? It was a bit much when it drips off stuff.\n\nJust some common sense - don't serve the food if 1) its freakin BURNT and 2) don't serve it if it doesn't match the description on the menu without warning the guest.\n\nIt's not rocket science Two Hippies. It's a grilled sandwich."
0,"I usually go to Kathy's Alterations and she is great.  I usually don't buy dry clean only items, but I had a dress that needed to be dry cleaned.  Took it in and was told I needed to pre-pay, which was fine.  When I went to pick it up I was told they were unable to clean it due to a built in belt made of leather which they said could be ruined by the dry cleaning process. What I can't believe is that I wasn't issued a refund. I paid cash.  Not much, but I don't want \""credit\"" since I can't bring that item back and I don't wear clothes that I have to have dry cleaned.  The teenagers working there were not \""authorized\"" to do anything and the owner is \""out of town\"" and a manager is \""not available\"".  Learn to run a business. I am always able to call the owner for help at my job if there is a problem. I won't be back. I should have checked other reviews first."
0,"MEH is the word to describe Carnegie. Only came here because we were tired, hungry, and it was inside the hotel. Came here with my cousin for some dinner. No line. Our waitress was super friendly. The two stars are mainly for her. \n$23.99 for a crappy open faced reubin...ehhh. I got a turkey one and about the only edible part was the turkey. It was slathered with melted swiss and the dressing was served on the side. Sorry. Not a good sandwich. \nGreek Salad...so-so. Nothing special especially for around $18. It was large though. Enough for two people. \nFries were about the only decent part. Nice and crispy. Highly recommended by our waitress. \nFor $50 what a crap-shoot of a meal. We barely ate much aside from some salad and fries. I would not come back here. I know restaurants in Vegas are expensive no matter what/where you eat but seriously. The food was not worth it. Also, the sandwiches or other meals do not come with a side. So that's right...nearly $24 for a stupid tasteless sandwich by itself folks. It's sadly not what you would expect."
0,"The fried chicken is nothing special. The entire experience is like (what I would imagine would be) going to an \""American Fast Food\"" joint in the Philippines. Which is kitsch and cute, but we're not in the Philippines, and there's both better Filipino food and American food readily available nearby."
0,"I figured with all the good reviews that I would love this place. I was wrong. I ordered the chile green and red burritos, one of each just in case I didn't like the other. Both tasted pretty nasty to me. I was hoping it would have at least a semi authentic taste, but the meat tasted as if it came from a can, and not off the bone. I could only stomach about 3 bites of each."
0,"Just horrible! The pizza was like the kind they'd serve in a school cafeteria. The wings tasted as if they'd come right out of a big. To top it off I paid over $40 for their largest size and dozen wings, might as well have gone to NYPD for those prices but better quality!"
1,"Nothing ruins a carpet more than having a 90 lb dog plus a 3 year old and me, who is generally clumsy.  My carpets looked like a war zone had taken place and I was thinking our collective spillage meant new carpets.  However, I called Mike out to have a look to see what he could do.  \n\nI've had mixed experiences with pro cleaners in the past.  One guy came in and threw some powder down and called it clean.  He cost me my security deposit of the place I was renting.  Another had some hand-machine that was far from professional.  \n\nMike showed up with this massive van with all the equipment mounted inside.  That's what I love to see.  He took to work on my nasties and an hour and a half later - good as new.  \n\nNo kidding!  My carpets were so tramped down and dirty that walking on the hardwood was more comfortable.  He cleaned then back to the way they looked when installed nearly 10 years ago.  He then tackled the couches that I've had since college.  Never cleaned once and smelled like Golden Retriever.  They came out great.  \n\nI would definitely use The Carpet Guy again!"
1,"Real Italian it ain't, but Carrabba's it a cut above other Americanized chains like Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill. What sets this place apart from the others is their woodfired grill and more \""exotic\"" ingredients for the palates of regular Joes. My favorite dish on the menu is their Chicken Bryan, a fire-roasted chicken breast (yes, a real breast, not a processed breast 'patty') topped with a lemon butter sauce, sundried tomatoes and goat cheese. \n\nCarrabba's is also really good at accommodating special eating plans. I'm a low carber and they've always been super nice about letting me substitute veggies for pasta (they'll even make the chicken soup WITHOUT noodles in it if you ask). I appreciate the level of customization that they offer. The olive oil on the table is crap, but they do get extra points for bringing out a grater with fresh parmesan cheese to top all of your entrees. \n\nThe prices are a bit high for what you get (plan on spending about $50 on an appetizer, soda and entrees for two -- not including alcohol or dessert, before tip), but at least they serve fresh, quality food.  \n\nThe service at this location has always been good and friendly. The restaurant atmosphere is really drab and sad and is in need of a makeover. It's depressing, actually. VERY dark (not the good, romantic kind of dark, the super dismal and melancholic kind of sad) and VERY dank. Ask for a seat near the open kitchen so you can watch the cooks in action."
1,"First time here and ordered the Bobbie, Thanksgiving dinner on a bun (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo).  Bread was fresh and everything was seasoned nicely.  We got the medium size (12\"") and wow, it must have weighed about 2 pounds!  Plenty of food for myself and my hubby.  We were the only ones in the shop at the time, so our order was processed pretty quickly.  I don't know how busy this place gets, but I believe one should phone in one's order to save time.  Something I noticed: the floors were a little bit dirty, not so much to dissuade me from trying a sandwich, but just enough to wonder why it wasn't cleaner, especially when there was time and opportunity to attend to it?  I'll come here again to try a different sandwich....and to see if the floor's cleaner.  :)"
1,"The only place I visited in Vegas that I'd like to buy a condo.  The staff here... unbeleivable.\n\nA short story... WHile waiting in the lobby for a vendor to join me for dinner a guest and his yappy dog came in the front door walking towards the elevator.\n\nAs soon as the dog hit the (presumably very expensive) carpet it drug his face the whole way.\n\nWhere as I would have hung the dog by his collar the bellhop and receptionist smiled accomodatingly.\n\nLots of kids and pets in the 20 minutes or so I was there.\n\nThe bar tender was more interested in talking with the attractive female staff though.\n\nOh, the gift shop has very cool things and they aren't over priced (which shocked me)."
0,"Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. \n\nWe were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. \n\nOur waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.\n\nThe meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.\n\nWe ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces. \n\nThen we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish. \n\nThe tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them. \n\nFinally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it). \n\nAfter that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return."
0,"If You Like Noise, Drunk Kids, This is the Place for You\n\n\nThe Hotel in general is very nice but with 20 and 30 something drunks kids stumbling all over the hotel, the unusable public restrooms.  If you got rid of that the place would be great but they are catering to these kids with the all day and night clubs, and they simply do not have enough staff to keep the public areas clean with all these slobs!!!!"
0,"Gosh I hate to be the one to do this but, this was not even near 5 star caliber to me (especially comparing to other caf\u00e9s in the area like Lux).\n\nI had some errands to run in Cen Pho and I really didn't want to totally derail my diet for lunch. So I did a yelp search for salads and this popped up. Imagine my delight to find all raving reviews! I headed over immediately.\n\nI love the atmosphere. It's really cute and cozy, but a little industrial too with the concrete floors and counters. Love, love the teal chairs, white brick walls and fresh flowers.\n\nAnyway, the service, while nice, was pretty aloof. And it wasn't busy so I don't know what the deal was. Perhaps they were busy making call in lunch orders that I was ignored?\n\nI got a small spinach salad. For $4 I felt the portion was fair. However, my salad was supposed to come with Pomagranate and it didn't have it on there. I initially wanted to try the soup but they had run out (by noon?).\n\nI got a Belgian waffle for my son. My salad came out (which took awhile), I finished it and we were still waiting on the waffle. I was trying to catch the eye of one of the employees because my son was really hungry, and he's 4 so he was about to go postal.\n\nFinally a young girl asked of there was anything else, and I reminded her of the waffle and cookie we ordered. Her response was oh sorry that wasn't on the ticket (she was being polite not snarky - never know how that might come across in a review). But she was the one who took my order so I was confused as to how those items were left off the ticket.\n\nAnyway, the waffle and cookie finally came out. They were really good. In fact, the food is really good and fresh. No doubt about that.\n\nBut my overall experience was just weird. In fact on the way out, a gentleman asked how was everything and I was like ok, food was good but it took a long time and the Pomagranate was left off my salad. His response, were there pomagranates supposed to be on your salad? I was like yeah all the ingredients of the salad are right here on the menu. He just shrugged his shoulders and said yeah it happens sometimes. He wasn't rude, but dismissive. Didn't apologize or anything.\n\nAs I walked out, one of the ladies was rolling out dough to make cinnamon rolls. They are probably delicious. \n\nThey seem like super nice people who serve good food. But they could use improvement on the customer service and efficiency."
0,"Biggest complaint I had with this place is the cleanliness.  Floor was pretty dirty and the legs of the chairs were gross.  The sandwich was ok, wouldn't run out and get another one because it was fantastic.   I asked for a side of yellow mustard and he gave me Heinz mustard packets which is usually no big deal, but the mustard inside these packets was gross.  I think it might have been way over its expiration date.  I had to scrape it off."
1,"Tried Sushi Ken for more than 10 times, I love their sushi(Rainbow roll,Dragon Roll) and Ramen!\nGreat family restaurant,I have to say this is a slam dunk 5 stars.\n\nJapanese owner run this business, absolutely authentic Japanese Sushi.Green-Tea Tempera ice cream is the best,make sure you order  that for your desert.  \n\nTip: Always crowed Friday& Saturday night ,better to get your table is call them for a reservation."
1,"Hamburger Heaven sounds a lot less suave than it actually is.  For me, at least, the name strikes up images of post-club buger vans selling fat, gristle and sugary ketchup in a napkin.  Contrary to expectation, however, the food is actually excellent.  All their burgers are freshly made with good quality pork, beef or chicken, and they have a good quality range of fresh salad and sauces to accompany them.  \nI went for a beef burger in a bun with onions, lettuce and ketchup which tasted amazing.  It was all the better fr the quality of the bun which was nice and fluffy, not one of those crumbly things you get in Lidl.  \nTo top this off, the service is friendly and the prices are reasonable, making it a great place to visit for lunch or dinner when you fancy an alternative to the mighty Big Mac."
1,"Dr. Reese Turner is someone you can trust.   He is not out there to make a buck.  He really cares.  When I was in a panic, Dr. Reese met with me.   The front desk set up a no-charge consultation within two days of my call.  He confirmed my fear that my current dentist was on the aggressive side.   His position after viewing my x-rays:  It's my mouth and my decision but in his opinion, only one of three areas sited by my current dentist made sense to him to fix and even then, he suggested waiting.  This was so refreshing.  I am a patient for life.    Not only is he saving my teeth, he is saving me money.   My strongest recommendation!"
1,"They do have my sizes; but damn are they expensive!  Only name brands can be expensive, but you get what you pay for.  I guess I'm just bitter that I had to go here for an extra 1/4 inch in the neck for a fitted shirt (guess that's what I get for being bigger than the average American).  Michael Kors white french cuff shirt is the most comfy I've ever worn."
1,"I really liked the stylist I had, her name is Tracy.  She did a great job and the prices are pretty much in line w/other salons. \n\nOne thing I did appreciate is the fact that although the salon is trendy and very nicely set up, the stylists in there are actually all down to earth and friendly rather than being snobby or anything like I had anticipated from past experiences at other nice establishments like this. \n\nThe only reason why I didn't give it a five star and rated a four is because I wasn't offered a beverage throughout my service.    However, I did receive one later when I asked. :) \n\nAll in all, they were great!  Most importantly I am very happy w/my style!"
1,"This is by far my favourite restaurant in Edinburgh. I've lost count of how many times I've visited (going back tomorrow too!). The food is Californian style, but this doesn't mean burgers. The menu is completely different to any others I've seen. Ingredients are mixed in novel ways, and the presentation is always fabulous. For main courses, you have it just how you want it - you choose your main item (their seared fish is fantastic), the sauce to go with it, and the accompanying sides.\n\nAll wines and beers are American, and they import a huge selection of wines which you can buy to take home too. It's not expensive for the quality of the food. The menu changes every month, so it's worth getting your name added to their mailing list. They also have a loyalty card. And the staff are absolutely lovely.\n\nIf you've never been, do yourself a favour ASAP!"
0,"It is a beautiful, but largely unoccupied Japanese restaurant.  We started with potato croquettes (3 *) and soft shell crab (0*).  The crab was unrecognizable, overcooked, tasteless and overpriced.  We each ordered the misoyaki butterfish, black cod (4* Forks) which was accompanied by miso soup (1*), salad (dressing congealed - 1*), rice and green tea.  Service was both pleasant and efficient."
0,FYI - We went to the restaurant today 4/26/11 but they are no longer there. We called the phone number but it's no longer in service.
1,"Found this spot by chance and was pleasantly surprised. Great service and even better food. 99 cent Margaritas on Saturday to top it off!?!? Who can ask for more? Locals made it sure to recommend dishes to try and my fav was the \""Pollo Burro\"" Walking in to this place and seeing how many people were there was the best sign I could get that I was in for a treat. Def must go!!! Additional parking in the back if the front is full. Bon Appetite."
0,"Attention grouponers!  Refund your groupon and avoid this place! \n\nI too was part of the groupon disaster yesterday.  Calling this place a joke would be an understatement.\n\nMy group of 4 arrived there at about 10 (so an hour into the buffet service).  Already, they were out of fajitas, tortillas, fruit, and pancakes.  We picked up the scraps that were left of everything else and took a seat.  Thereafter, it took about 30 minutes-and a couple rounds of propmting our waitness-before we even received our water and memosas.  \n\nThings then went from awful to pathetic.  The buffet line proceeded to run out of every single item at the same time.  It remained completely empty for at least 30 minutes!  So now, 90 minutes into the service, there was NO food.  It was a \""no-ffet.\""  That's when the memosas dried up.  Although they did give us margaritas to make up for the memosas, the margaritas lacked any discernible alcohol and were overloaded with ice and margarita mix.  That aside, how do you run out of memosas 90 minutes into a 5 hour breakfast service?!?  It wasn't even like the place was busy.  While we were there, they had maybe 20 guests at max!\n\nThe worst part of all of this was the dishonestly revealed throughout this whole experience.  The groupon promised a buffet that \""stretches across the restaurant.\""  In reality, the buffet had 8 items and fit onto maybe a 6 food table.  Even if it had food (which it didn't), it would have been a disappointment.  What was worse was that even after the \""no-ffet\"" ran out of food, the hostess continued to sit people-providing them no warning whatsoever that there was no food.  It was almost comical to watch their complete disregard as they sat people, only to watch the people walk up to the buffet line that lacked food!  \n\nIn short, if you want a buffet that lacks food and drink, this is the place for you!  If you want what was promised in the groupon, well, you better keep dreaming."
0,"Where do i start ?\n\nThis is my first review and the first time I have ever been so let down by all the good reviews!\n\nSaw it on tv and it looked great!\nReal life, unfortunately, was a let down.\n\nHere are my gripes:\n1) had breakfast after 11am. They only serve scrambled eggs after 11.\n     for the price they ask, this seems to be a bit lame!\n\n2) pancake was not good!  very tough and very short on flavor!\ntough?  i could shingle my roof with them!\n\n3) my 3 eggs and bacon breakfast was $9.00. Not to far out of range   until  you count the bacon!  2 strips of bacon!!\nThis was not thick bacon, nor was it special bacon!\ntwo strips of thin regular bacon!!\n\nHow can they boast about their 1ib burgers and giant pancakes and oversized and overstuffed everything,  and then serve 2 slices of thin regular bacon!\n\n4) dried out biscuit!!  they did not even serve butter and jam with the biscuit!\nDo they feel that it was so good that it needed no help?\n\nI do not think that the management ever eats there, or else they would have to know that they are sub par!\n\nWaitress was good though!"
0,"Not too sure what I think about this place.  The menu is EXTREMELY limited and way overpriced for chicken fingers and fries.  For lunch, I ordered a #2 combo which included 3 small chicken fingers, a handful of french fries, a slice of toast, and a small soda, which came to about $7.  I would have expected a lot better.\n\nI wouldn't waste my time coming back here, unless I was in the mood to spend my money on a less-than-mediocre meal.  I'd rather do McDonald's."
0,Nothing exciting. Tasteless guacamole. Would have expected more flavour in a Mexican restaurant.
0,Bad. Only good for 21 year olds and the creeps that want to stalk them. Tasteless interior and expensive drinks. Bad dj.
0,"Four stars?!  Seriously - FOUR stars?!  \n\nI'm beginning to wonder about some of the people, who post reviews on Yelp.  I admit to often being a pretentious horse's ass, who thinks he's better than most people and says it out loud.\n\nGolden Corral offers you lots of substandard food at reasonable --- not great:  reasonable --- prices and that's about all there is to say.  You won't find any of the chefs, who cook here to have passed audition for Hell's Kitchen or Master Chef  (though Chef Ramsey MIGHT have allowed them to clean his restaurants' bathrooms).  This is not to fault them or other people, who work at this location in Goodyear:  they're attentive, friendly, quick to serve and overall excellent employees.  But the food is just nasssssty.  Not \""nasty\"":  nassssssty.  If you meet someone on a date you think you might want to get to know better and they say they like this place, it's time for you to hit Craigslist again.\n\nMost of the food here is oversalted and of questionable quality.  Enough grease is produced in this place to qualify it as an automotive lube center during off hours.  And thank God Morton's Salt has found a place in the Valley to unload its excess salt packages ... unfortunately, the packages have been pre-opened and dumped in anything which might look like food.\n\nI'm sorry, but when workers from Domino's and Waffle House laugh at a place, you know there's something seriously wrong; hit Black Bear Diner up the road instead"
0,"Why am I never eating here again?\n\nIt wasn't the pizza.\n\nIt wasn't the strange, obtrusively angled interior.\n\nOr the fact that a million TVs are flashing at you.\n\nIt was the horrible service.\n\nI took my mom here, and it's the first time I can recall stiffing someone on a tip. There wasn't even a manager that looked available we could complain to. You would think with the economic crises, people would want to hold on to their jobs -- but it amazes me the utter incompetency I see in the big chain service industry. From the minute we entered, two hostesses who have no clue, to a server who has no clue, to a chef who messes our order up, and actually not receiving our drinks until AFTER the food arrives, then waiting AGES to receive a bill. It's just taking the piss.\n\nRedonkulous."
0,This was the slowest Steak n' Shake I have ever been to! I waited in the drive-thru line for about twenty five minutes when there were only two cars in front of me. I would have just went inside but I had felt I had already committed and would probably have waited just as long inside.\n\nOnce I got to the window the girl did not apologize for the wait or even say hi. Just told me the total and then handed me the bag not even a good bye. I'm not expecting insane service at Steak 'n Shake but an hello and good bye would be nice.\n\nI will say the fries were gold and soggy but that burger with the egg and bacon on top was so good for a fast food burger!
0,Just in case you don't live here and need some Wendy's...this one is permanently closed.
1,"A really good local coffee shop in Surprise.  Amoungst all of our corporate coffee shops this place is a hidden gem.  They have live music, local artwork on display, and great coffee.\n\nDo yourself a favor and try it!"
1,"We have been to the one in MN several times but this one is huge! Great food, service was a bit rushed but all in all a good place to be. Sign up for their email club before you go!"
1,"The service was a little slow to start off, but when it came to the food it was definately interesting. I got the Triple Bypass burger which is 1 1/2 lbs of beef plus 11 slices of bacon, tomatoes, onions and cheese for $14. I also got the butterfat chocolate shake which came with a slice of butter as garnishment. Perhaps I will go here again in a few months after my body recuperates from this time."
0,"Can we please just change their name?\n\nThe few experiences that I have had at The \""Good\"" Egg have been horrible. The food is never good and I feel like the waitresses really loathe their jobs. The one time I did have an extremely nice waitress, the food was the worst. It seems like it is never a win-win with this place, but rather lose-lose. \n\nI doubt I will ever think about going back here, but in the rare case that I do, I will hopefully have a better experience."
0,"I walked out (12-30-14, 2:30 PM) in disgust after female server tried to seat me in a tiny booth even though there were many bigger booths and tables available. Asked to talk to manager but told he wasn't available."
0,"Um, how did the other reviewers get food????\n\nJ and I went in on a Friday night with a WPXI half off deal.  We were ready to engulf ourselves in burgers and beers for at least $50 worth. \n\nInstead, I went to the bar and asked for a menu since there was no one else working in the place besides the one bartender on a Friday night.  She gave me a tiny happy hour menu.  I said, no, I'd like the dinner menu.  She said they weren't serving food besides happy hour.  I said, right now or ever?  She said ever.  They were getting new menus printed and weren't serving food.  \n\nShe did not tell me when they would be done or what else I should get.  I told her that I had a coupon.  She smiled and said nothing. \n\nSince WPXI won't get back to me about returning the half off deal - if only I could write a review on that - we will be returning for drinks and happy hour, but I will not be spending a cent more than the coupon. \n\nWho doesn't serve food when you advertise that you are the best burger in the city?"
0,"If eating food counted towards your gambling debt than this place should be considered part of your losses. In fact this place is a total loss, a \""bad beat\"". \n\nI had a beef stew over rice, which came out quickly but it wasn't anything special. Brother had a pad thai dish which he said that he's had better.\n\nThe place is over priced for average food, but I can't complain about the price, it's Vegas."
0,The food was pretty great.\n\nToo bad I couldn't enjoy it because of how the restaurant moves.  I asked the hostess beforehand.. if I get motion sickness very easily... is this a bad idea for me. She assured me no.\n\nTrust me.. it was. Go to the Eiffel Tower instead. No need to go this far down the strip.
1,Yum! I have been here a few times now and I have not been disappointed. The specialty coffees are great. I had a latte and it came out piping hot. I've had an omelet and the eggs Benedict and both were very good. Last time I was here I saw someone with an awesome looking Bloody Mary that had strips of bacon garnish which I will definitely try next time.
0,"I would not refer this gym to anyone. Trainers push you to sign up for their personal training sessions each time you go into the gym. Some people just want to go to the gym and not be hassled. Even with headphones in, you get tapped on the shoulder. If you don't sign up for your free one time training, calls constantly come in and they question you every time you go into the gym. \n\nThe end all for me was when I asked for my dates to be changed for my payments. I was told it was no problem and taken care of. First month that my account was overdrawn, I was understanding and emailed Jay, the owner for confirmation on the date change. He offered free training session. I declined, just wanted to be refunded the 25$ overdraft fee or even apply it to my account for the next month. Jay declined. I tried to be understanding as mistakes can happen and I get that. \n\nSecond time was the kicker for when the funds were taken out on the wrong date, it drained my account so I could not fulfill other financial obligations. When contacting the business owner, his response was offering free training sessions again and made it perfectly clear via email that he only wanted \""his business to grow.\"" Jay did not offer to refund the 25$ overdraft fees, did not offer to put it on as a credit to my account, just wanted me to take these classes/training sessions. \n\nAfter several attempts at just getting the overdraft credited to my account, I finally reported the business to the BBB. Clearly he does just want his business to grow and is not looking to help those who are inconvenienced by his financial mistakes. I think I will just go back to LA Fitness where they were honest, trustworthy, and did not have an environment where you had to avoid eye contact to make sure no one hunted you down to sign up for more services."
1,"Don't let a good place down.  Longhorn consistently provides a good value and great food.\n\nI had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here, it's near the BestBuy in a mall area.  Classic exterior and very nice interior with a comfortable bar area and large dining areas, which would be great for a company function or family dinner.\n\nPersonally I like their Salmon and Sierra Chicken meals more than their steaks, but when I have had a steak it is top quality.  I think their grilled chicken is the best anywhere.  Choices of sides and a salad for a reasonable price.\n\nDefinitely will be returning to this location."
0,"What a mess. First the reciptionist did not understand Humana dental insurance and got all upset about my having Humana only to calm down and apologize and admit she doesn't know anything about insurance. Next, the dental assistant touches my swollen face really hard and hurts me, and then the dentist comes in and he has no clue that nicotine gum wears the enamel off of teeth. I've talked to lots of people who do know this, and I would think that a dentist would know this. He thought that nicotine gum is loaded with sugar. It's not. He told me my tooth was not damaged from chewing nicotine gum for 3 and a half years, that it must be something I am doing wrong. Really? I had one filling in my entire life and no other dental work and I am 56 years old, so what exactly other than chewing highly acidic nicotine gum was I doing wrong? How many people have 1 filling and no dental work needed by the time they are 56. I'm sure it's all my fault. I was having to tell him about other people I have talked to who have gone to their dentists and their dentists told them that chewing nicotine gum wore the enamel off of their teeth. Then when I complained to the reciptionist over the phone, she blamed it on me, got real defensive. Also, I just moved here last week and don't have a car, so I walked over there. I find out that his brother has an office right here where I live, yet he did not refer me to him but he knew I had walked over there and had no car. then when I contacted the brother's office, no response. What a mess."
0,Us airways is horrible.  Their stewardesses are more concerned with their cell phones than anything else. As the plane was landing people were. Standing in the aisles.  I had a connecting flight but they would not call the gate or do anything to help.  Ran all the way to the gate only to have the person at the desk say too late. Too bad.  I will not fly us air again.
1,"When it comes to chain delivery pizza, Hungry Howie's and Papa Johns take all. Hungry Howie's is good fast pizza. But realistically I think that it takes the cake because of the crust selections! \n\n-Original\n-Ranch\n-Cajun\n-Onion\n-Garlic Herb\n-Butter\n-Butter Cheese\n-Sesame.\n\nThe fact that you get to choose your crust is a genius concept and I would take Howies over Pizza Hut, Dominos, and most other big pizza chains."
1,"I love street tacos. I especially love street tacos that can be ordered from outside of a little window, be it a truck or a window stand. Don't worry there is counter service inside the place too. I'm not sure if there is any indoor sitting, we sat outside. It's Vegas! \nWe were excited to see they had Carne Al Pastor cooking. Real Al Pastor turning on the spit, and a nice little pineapple dangling above it. Mmm Mmm. I had 2 tacos Al Pastor and 1 Carne Asada, with the spicy green salsa. They have about 5 different fresh salsas to choose from. \nThe Al Pastor was good, the meat had a great traditional flavor, yes I wanted more. The Carne Asada had a little different flavor maybe cumin or cloves, but it didn't taste so great so. Stick to the Al pastor. \n3 tacos 1 beer under 10 bucks.  Yes I'm going back."
0,"Uhhhhh, that's it? This is the two queen bedroom? I feel like I can almost touch wall to wall! No suite upgrade and the service inside the diamond lounge was fcuking HORRIBLE! That A-HOLE had the nerves to walk by everyone except for us! and finally when I managed to wave him down I asked for another round of drinks. His responds was \""OF WHAT?!\"" Same drink you idiot!\n\nThanks, but no thanks this would probably be my last time back."
0,"I was never going to write a review of this awful place as I couldn't justify the modest effort it would take to push the computer keys on  a review of such a low-brow, bland restaurant. But then I read a positive review a few before this one and I had to chime in.\nOkay...here goes:\nCompared to this place, the Olive Garden is Joel Robuchon. \nHowever if you think that tasteless food (in large quantities), served by bored, zombie wait-staff is something to cheer about, and you've hit all the buffets in town, then perhaps this is your kind of place.\nHowever, if food with taste and style and care is what you're willing to pay hard-earned dollars for, then this is the Gateway to Hell.\nGod help all who enter."
0,"Banh Mi!!! I was so ecstatic to find some place serving that was rated decently I almost went 40 over on the freeway.. I love Banh Mi and have been blessed to have some really good viet sandwich shops in Houston for majority of my life. That being said, my expectation for this place was way too high, to a point I might be underrating it by a star.\n\n- Location\nUnless you've been to some Chinatown places the location may or may not freak you out a bit. In like a \""I Am Legend\"" sort of way the shop is located inside a deserted Viet mall which has a equally deserted parking lot. You have to go look for it which may actually deter quite a few people, but inside its pretty much as fast food as you can get. Limited seating space with quick sandwiches.\n\n- The Banh Mi\nI'll just break it down simply:\n- Bread is not nearly as crisp as it should be (honestly I don't even think its a French Baguette)\n- Meat is just not tender and it seems to have been sitting there for ages (rubbery).\n- The veggies they put in are fresh, which is good.\n- THEY DONT HAVE EGG :( - This really put me over the edge because any good Banh Mi has a fried egg in it.\n\nAll of that while only being able to pay cash really just makes this place fall short. If you've never had a banh mi or don't have it often, you'll most likely like this place. For those of us who have  been cultured, it's just not acceptable."
0,"I found renting from your company to be the worst experience I've ever had from a car rental company.  Unfortunately for me, fortunately for you, I had a prepaid reservation. Otherwise I would have gone anywhere else.\n \nI stood in line for almost 20 minutes at skyharbor international airport with only one person in line before me. The other rental counter that shares your space, fox rental, had 4 people servicing their desk. I counted how many more people were waited on before I was \""served\"" at your counter (8). I also did not appreciate your policy of $350 deposit on my credit card without being forewarned. \n \nYour return area was just as bad with only ONE return slot which was already filled. \n \nI will pay full price before I rent from you again. A copy of this review will be posted online for other readers."
1,"The Biltmore is an incredible resort and even nicer than many other properties I have seen in my 7 years of travel experience through the Caribbean, Mexico and even Hawaii.  This resort is large, with beautiful impressive landscaping, fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, multiple pools, and an amazing golf course.  \n\nI opted for the Octallia rooms, which are in a newer section with upgraded in room amenities along with access to the Concierge area where you can get free drinks, snacks, breakfast and access to someone to assist with dinner reservations, business center, etc.\n\nOur room was spacious and luxurious.  I realllllly liked our room. I am big into having a comfortable place to sleep, cuddle with my honey and nap when the weather turns sour. I don't understand people who don't like nice rooms, b/c you really do spend a lot of time in there.  I looooved the bathroom which had a deep oversized tub (my fave) and I appreciated the small touches like the sea salt and nice bath products.  \n\nThe pools are busy if you choose one of the two main pool options, but the staff around them was easily accessible, friendly and honest.  We had no issues and the day we rented the cabana at the pool ($150 for partial sun/$200 for all day sun) we received outstanding service.  The cabana had a nice little room, TV and it's own bathroom along with an outdoor table and two lounge chairs.  If you prefer to have a pool to yourself, the Octallia area is deserted as well as a couple of other smaller pools but they ALSO do not have poolside service.  Chairs by the pools are first come, first serve and on the weekends, it did appear to be difficult to score a good chair so get down there early.\n\nThis resort is also incredibly family friendly.  We were there at the tail-end of spring break which was obvious as there were tons of families in the pool and running around the property.  This didn't bother us at all but I was a little surprised.  The main pool did offer a slide but it wasn't operating.  Anyway - the point is, a great luxury family friendly option for those with kiddos!\n\nThe spa was incredible.  We got 80 minute Dream Maker massages and it was AWESOME (but expensive).  I felt pampered and relaxed after.  Well worth it but oh so pricey.\n\nThe reason I am not going to give this place 5 stars is b/c everything is CRAZY expensive.  I mean, everything is literally double what it would be anywhere else and room service carried a $4 delivery charge along with a 23% surcharge tax on top of the already crazy 14% \""tourism\"" tax which we paid at every hotel in the city. . RIDICULOUS.\n\nSo please keep in mind, everything is on the pricier side. This is not a \""budget\"" friendly place.   But it is a luxury resort in a fabulous location with beautiful areas to dine outdoors and enjoy a drink with the ones you love.  If you are comfortable with the price, upgrade to the Octallia rooms - it's all in the details."
0,"Went there after hearing about the Arizona Cardinals promotion, if the Cards won, you get a free medium coffee the day after the game.  Well, I went, didn't know about the app for the smart phone.  Was told that I need the app and the phone wasn't with me.   Didn't get the coffee, walked away unhappy."
1,"If you can make peace with the fact that you're going to pay casino floor prices for this food, it's really a good option for lunch.\n\nI had a simple lunch- a club sandwich which was fresh and delicious and served with fresh greens with a nice vinaigrette dressing. \n\nI would definitely eat here again. The service was fine (and it was super busy during the lunch rush)."
0,"Engrained has made a few good dishes in their time. I was really let down though when, after inquiring about why they stopped labelling vegan options, I got an e-mail directly from the chef in which he told me that vegans are only a small part of the campus population (1%). Well, I already knew this, I have no delusions of a vegan majority, so it just came across as insulting. If you send a question to a restaurant because you have a peanut allergy and the response starts with \""most of our customers don't have peanut allergies\"", how would you feel? What if you keep kosher or halal and the chef tells you \""most of our customers are Christians\""? Obviously veganism and allergies and religion are different, but it's never a good idea to essentially tell a customer their concerns aren't important because they're in the minority. Also, the food was never worth the prices and probably never will be, food takes forever to arrive even for simple dishes, the ordering system is bizarre and they are often out of menu items. Their hours are also really frustrating."

0,"On arrival we were told it would be 30 minutes before seats would be \navailable, but the same meal could be prepared for us in the kitchen. We opted for this alternative rather than wait which turned out to be a big, big mistake. We started out with the edamame appetizer. This represented our first and last experience with boiled salted soybeans - totally tasteless. My wife chose the halibut dinner while I requested chicken. She received two decent sized pieces of fish, but each was overdone. My chicken, cut into  inch cubes, was dry. Each entree included miso soup, noodles, veggies, rice and salad. The soup was hot, but everything else was  served cold. Service was affable, but slow."
0,"We decided to visit the Cupcake ATM last night after midnight when they closed just to taste the product and see what it was like.  We agreed on the cinnamon cupcake.  \n\nAfter paying the $4.25, the little door opened and we got our cupcake.\n\nIt was a regular sized cupcake and it had no frosting.  It tasted like a great BASE for a yummy cupcake with other flavors and frosting, but alone it was just...cinnamon cake.\n\nVery disappointed.  Not worth $4.25 or even what they charge in store."
1,Appreciated the non gaming and non smoking facility.  It's a very beautiful hotel.  Great views of Vegas.
1,"Huge Binkley's fan.  Hit Bink's Midtown for restaurant week.  Some dishes, amazing.  Others not so much.  The corn chowder and the chocolate desert were worth the drive.  Our server was some cute 20 something airhead.  We heard \""my bad\"" all night as we waited for our water, our wine flights, our bread.  One person got his appetizer with dinner.  My Bad!  So, why 4 stars?  The dishes that were good were really, really good.  Very comfortable place. I'm giving them a break for it being an unusual week!"
0,"Avoid at all costs - found chewed up bubblegum in the food\n\nWe found chewed up bubblegum in our food during lunch buffet.  What is worse is that the manager refused to throw out the dish from the buffet and replace the contents.  People, this is a bad sign since they are willing to cut corners and worse to save a few bucks.  \nAnyways why would they spit out gum into the food?  This is so gross!  I will not go there again since I am sure that they really don't give a damn about their customer's health and would rather have us get sick than waste a couple of bucks."
0,Food is about a 3.5 but the service is not the best. We went in the day the had promoted (for a month) their $1 taco day. Put a reminder in m phone and took the girls from work they without notice canceled it the girl at the window talk to us like we were morons! We showed her the Facebook post and still talked to poorly. Then once we made a comment on the post on the Facebook promotion saying we were there it was taken down no apology... I just think it's bad business.... I'd rather go spend money at a sit down that actually knows how to run a place than a place thy can't even run a Facebook lol but as well the food is a little over priced for the taste not by too much but for two people you can easily spend over $25 there are much better places to spend your money!
1,Great airport with lots to shop and eat! Easy to navigate.
1,I decided to try this location again on 8/24 and unlike the first time everything was very good from the start to the end. My server Ryan was very friendly and polite. Beer was very cold and my food was delicious. i love their calamary! My friend tried Lobster tacos and they were awesome! I enjoyed my visit very much!
1,"I highly encourage everyone to give Carrabba's a try!  Yes, it is a chain and you can find one in every major city, but if it's good food what does it matter?!?!  This isn't your local Olive Garden by any means.  I'm a big fan of the Chicken Bryan!  I've always had great service at this location and the seasonal specials add a pretty good mix to the menu.  I recently tried a seasonal cedar plank salmon that made me wanna order a second round!  \n\nI do not recommend the curb side to go ordering here.  They seem to be in a bit of a hurry and on more than one occasion I've gotten my go to Bryan to go on my lunch break only to tear into undercooked chicken.  No bueno.  Eat in or move on."
1,"This is the place that you go to if you wanna hang with the big kids.  Feel cool. Be cool.  Each time I've gone there, I felt one degree cooler the minute I walked in.  Kona Grill has a neighborhood feel to it even though it sits at a mall.  I like sitting at the bar blindingly picking whatever looks good on the menu because you can't go wrong with it. The bartenders are attentive and friendly.  I love it when I can take the drive and stop by at Kona.  I hope this place never goes out of business."
1,"This is my favorite spot to hang out and just relax in my neighborhood. I am currently away from Arizona and find myself missing the Black Cat.  I highly recommend giving this coffee house a try.  Very friendly owners and staff, great coffee and lunch / snacks."
0,"I bought a voucher for this place from one of the deal sites. They accidentally crossed of my name on their list showing that my voucher was already used when it hadn't been. They then proceed to tell me that their verification method was fool proof (how can it be when nothing is scanned and everything is manually checked off by hand?) Then they tried to prove that the voucher I brought in was a photocopy reproduction (it wasn't, it was printer from a printer). All in all, a terrible experience, tried to make me out to be a thief. Why would I even go through all that trouble and reproduce a very \""real looking\"" fake voucher to save $10?!? At the end they realized their mistake. By then I had already 25 mins of my time and my order had already gotten cold. There were no apologies from the restaurant. The food was also very salty and the bubble tea was very chalky. They use powered coffeemate to cream their teas which has a huge taste difference from actual condensed or fresh milk. With all the Chinese food options in that area, I know I will never go back to this place."
0,"I came Today to this place because a friend of mine got $40 for a lot of clothes (old and used nothing fancy) and I brought 3 bags with almost all spring-summer clothes. The girl was so rude and didn't talk to me at all and She just put two tags in two clothes ( Vans and a Guess T-shirt) and She told me that She was gonna give me $12 for both and She didn't take the rest of the clothes, that were dresses and t-shirts...That was aweful and ridiculous. They were taking ugly stuff and pretty big sizes. She just told me that they weren't looking for that style. The clothes that I brought were, some of them pretty new and in good condition.\nAfter that I realized that I wanted to use some of my clothes again or just it them to my friends that would like modern and fashionable good clothes.\nAwful place, don't go there never ever..."
1,"This place was just plan FUN!! the girls got in free the guys had to pay $10. It was a really upbeat place good music hip hop and dance, everyone was there to boogie and drink and boogie some more, its not one the LV Hot spots, but there is a lax dress code, no line, good size dance floor, and a lot of people just looking to dance and have a good time without on the hollywood bs."
0,"I read a lot of reviews that said this show was over rated and didn't believe them... well, now that I've seen it, I'm afraid I have to agree with the less than stellar reviews.  I really wanted to like it, but it seems like the star of the show is the stage, and I guess that's not really why I'd go see a Cirque show.  It was slow, the clowns were not interesting, and I really only liked a couple of the acts.  There's no denying that the cross divers were quite impressive, but the other acts were a bit ho hum.  The show was OK, but I hear that Le Reve and Love are much better and cost a lot less."
1,"Not only did Janet finish my alterations in one week, she also went way below my budget. She is professional and courteous and her salon is in a central location. \n\nMy dress is comfortable and fits great. I went in thinking I would like a second dress for the reception but after she made the hooks for the bustle I knew that I would want to stay in this dress for the whole night. \n\nI highly recommend her for any bride or bridesmaid looking for alterations!"
0,"This place made me wish I had a magic carpet and could at the exact moment I escalated in , teleport back to San Francisco. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
1,"I buy most of my shoes at Jones Bootmaker for two very good reasons - 1) this particular Jones very often has massive sales racks so if you spend a bit of time looking, you can get a good bargain, and 2) they carry quality shoes.\n\nWhen buying shoes, I want them to look good, be comfortable, and be as cheap as possible.  Jones definitely ticks all of those boxes for me.  Now, don't come here expecting to spend a tenner on something you'll wear for 3 months and will then fall apart/go out of fashion.  These are proper shoes that you will have for a while, and this is reflected in the price, even when it is a bargain.  \n\nI've knocked off a star because the sale racks definitely give this place a somewhat downmarket feel to it and the staff can be a bit hit or miss."
0,"I used to come here for their decent food for brossard standard, but the service is so bad that i cannot recommand this restaurant anymore. The waiters are slow and unprofessional. We flagged one down from the cash registered, he just nodded at us, then went to the kitchen, returns at the cash and answers the phone that just rang! Totally ignored us! Will not be returning."
0,"This is a reasonably modern theater with good stadium seating, decent prices on concessions, and decent ticket prices (plus they have student tickets).  I also like their loyalty cup program (buy a four dollar cup and you get refills for a buck for the balance of the year).\n\nThere are plenty of downsides, though.  My primary complaint is that they don't do enough to keep the screening environment pleasant.  The patrons are very loud and very rude, and the theater staff just ignores it.  The last movie I saw here was full of talkers.  The guy sitting in front of me was texting and surfing the web on his Blackberry the whole time, and at one point in the middle of the movie he actually GOT ON HIS PHONE and had a conversation.  What the hell man?  Now a rude patron isn't the fault of the movie theater, but when the manager was standing ten feet away and didn't intervene, that's not right.  They should enforce their no phone policy and make the experience comfortable for the rest of us.  Also, they don't shut the door to their auditoriums, which mean light from the hall gets in and hits the screen.  Very distracting.\n\nThere are plenty of better megaplexes around here."

0,"Very confused about this establishment! My husband and I thought we would try it out since we had never been there before. I walked in and asked a young lady at the hostess station for a menu to look over quickly. She replied that they didn't really have any menus that night. I gave her a puzzled look. She saw that I was walking with a walker and stated that \""All of our TABLES are reserved for West Virginia fans. You can only get in if you are wearing WV gear.\""  I bluntly asked \""Are you telling me that I can't eat here?\"". She said \""Yes.\"" I said \""Nice.\""  And hobbled away. Discriminate much?????  Unbelievable! I work across the street and you just lost a regular customer. Seriously, Management, you discriminate against disabled persons? You are idiots!!!!  BTW, I saw a a family on the patio and they were NOT wearing WV gear! So your host is a lying POC! Discrimination!!"
1,This guys is excellent!\n\nYou would think you were his only client the way he knows every detail of your case.  He is very knowledgeable and he is very good about getting back to you quickly with any questions.  \n\n\nI have recommended him to friends and will continue to do so.
0,"I honestly dont know why they are still open. I bought their livingsocial deal and it was about to expire so I hurried to use it with my boyfriend. As we we found the resto and entered, I found the decoration pleasing but as we sat down and saw the menu for our livingsocial coupon...NOT IMPRESSED! I found the prices for the appetizers to be ridiculous and not worth it. We were only allowed to pick a limit of 7$ for the appetizers which is ridiculous because there was only 2 items: the soup du jour and a really not so good bruschetta. I took the bruschetta and my boyfriend took the soup. I would NEVER pay 6.95$ for neither. \n\nAfter the main course had a limit of 17$. I took the 4 cheeses pizza which was really good because of its thin crust and my bf took a plain spaghetti cuz he is lactose intolerant. But cmon....16.95$ for a plain spaghetti screams overpriced! \n\nLast but not least, i wanted a classic italian dessert that was homemade....nothing was homemade on the dessert menu. very disappointing! \n\nI also really got annoyed because when i usually use a livingsocial coupon, I have never been asked to print it and I basically just show it and they write down the voucher number. The lady who is probably the owner, didnt stop annoying me about printing it and then she comes to me with a paper with their email and pressed me to email them the coupon and didnt stop harassing me about the damn coupon. \n\nreally disappointed!!! Never again will I ever go to the resto! U have my word"
1,"Ive been here a number of times now and can safely say its one of my favorite tex mex restaurants in town. To me its Mexican with a texas kick. its not your traditional Mexican menu. I like that! \nMixed drinks are great, Ive tried a couple and im not a mixed drink kinda guy. but ill do it here.\nI don't know why manzettis (if that's how you spell it) didn't make it. the layout of this place is perfect in my book. \nStaff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. if they tell you its good it is."
1,"Met a friend here for dinner recently and we got the insalata della casa (house salad) which was delish!  I was sorta surprised at how good it was and couldn't stop eating it, but forced myself to restrain myself so I could have room for the pizza.  \n\nWe ordered a couple of pizzas to share.  We got the Capricciosa and the Prosciutto E Arugula pizzas and both of them were excellent.  The salad and pizzas were more than enough for 2 people to share and we even had left over pizzas.  \n\nThis place reminds me of Il Pizzaiola in Mt. Lebo and I love that place so I really enjoyed my experience at Pi!  Definitely want to come back and try some of the other pizzas."
0,"I decided to go to the Waffle House while my car was being serviced across the street. I was by myself and was promptly told I \""had\"" to sit at the counter because I was alone. I promptly left because sitting elbow to elbow while trying to eat didn't sound appealing. End up with a power bar and lemonaid from the gas station next door. Not a good job on your part guys!!"
1,"The Bellagio boasts the most diverse,carefully arranged feeding trough on the strip (that i can speak for), putting it in the running for one of the greatest buffets in the world. I came to their buffet between breakfast and lunch (we'll call it brunch) to a fair sized line. Despite this i was promptly seated, given my drink, and sent for my first helping. The cocktail shrimp were amazing and chilled perfect. The prime rib and london broil were exquisite. The African bluenose was delicious. Even the desserts, coming fresh from the oven, were pretty outstanding. I dont remember exactly what i paid, but it couldnt have been more than $20. It is by no means the cheapest buffet in town, but probably has the best value."
1,"J'avais lu sur le Lab sur Yelp, et \u00e7a m'int\u00e9ressait vraiment de le d\u00e9couvrir! L'occasion ne s'\u00e9tait tout simplement pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, jusqu'\u00e0 un certain samedi soir, alors que je n'avais pas une grande envie de sortir. Lorsque ma gang a dit o\u00f9 ils voulaient aller, j'ai retrouv\u00e9 ma motivation. Je n'aurais pas voulu manquer cela!\n\nArriv\u00e9s sur la rue Rachel, nous avons eu peur que ce soit ferm\u00e9, car de l'ext\u00e9rieur, c'est tr\u00e8s discret... Mais, \u00e9tant un samedi, nous avons quand m\u00eame tent\u00e9 notre chance, et c'\u00e9tait bel et bien ouvert. Ouf! Ce n'\u00e9tait vraiment pas trop plein, et avec l'ambiance feutr\u00e9e, la musique de fond et le bar avec une s\u00e9lection sans fin, nous nous sommes toute de suite sentis \u00e0 l'aise. Ce confort est aussi gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 notre merveilleux serveur, Eddy, qui nous a bien expliqu\u00e9 le concept du Lab et son offre (plus de 800 cocktails). Il a su faire d'excellentes recommandations aux ind\u00e9cis. Les cocktails sont faits de mani\u00e8re extr\u00eamement professionnelle, et c'est un plaisir de regarder les barmans travailler.

Le Japanese Gimlet a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 bien accueilli par notre groupe.\n\nOn peut dire que le Lab est un bar pour d\u00e9couvrir, et pas n\u00e9cessairement pour f\u00eater, d\u00e9pendamment de votre budget, car un cocktail de qualit\u00e9 a le prix qui vient avec!!!"

1,"Excellent food, service and decent prices for what you get. I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. \nOn my last visit, I had just gotten out of the hospital and needed to eat and was desperately craving...\""REAL GOOD HEARTY FOOD\""!!! I hit the nail in the head with this place!! I had the special of the day which was Mahi-Mahi in a Thai chile lime sauce, served with fire roasted grilled veggies and a fluffy wild rice pilaf with a nice glass of Chardonnay. The fish was fresh & the veggies were not soggy. My meal ended with a slice of their decadent cheesecake and a rich n bold cup of coffee!! Not bad for under $45dllrs for all including tip!!"
0,"I really like this place when I have a table other than that...I have to drink Alllllot, Surrender doesn't really seem like much of a night club as much as it does as just a big pool party only with out the bathing suits and floaties.

0,"Cottage Express is almost completely unremarkable, as they are one of many fast-food Chinese restaurants in strip malls in a city that has dozens, if not hundreds of them.  They do stand out in a few respects, and unfortunately food is not one of them.  At least not in a good way.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed is that their banner proclaims that this is the fifth location for this enterprise in the Charlotte area.  Yet strangely I have never noticed another, not even as I attempted to find one online while I was creating this review (note: I did eventually find one place up near El Taco Veloz with a similar name).  Perhaps a marketing tactic, or maybe they are just using another name for this new store.  Whatever the case, it is still odd that not a single other location turns up.  Anywhere.\n\nNext up is the staff.  Generally these small, dimly-lit quick-serve locations are staffed by individuals who do not speak particularly good English, yet are generally regarded as being at best one generation removed from (whatever country they have decided to represent via their food).  Not here.  This staff is instead a couple of teenage girls who are not only definitely American, they let you know at every turn they are interested in only your money, and the food is well down their list of priorities.\n\nFinally, instead of being served something that comes up rather quickly by a quick turn in one massive wok, you get to choose from a steam table.  Not quite a buffet, because you do not get to go back for seconds - and the food on the table does not appear to have been refreshed any time in the last few hours, or perhaps days."
0,"My dog had been seen by Dr. Anderson because the breeder I bought my dog from recommended him. Long story short, my dog  had to go to a vet hospital. The dog had a very enlarged prostate and UTI. The vet hospital provided antibiotics to help fight the infection and recommended the dog get neutered the following week. During that procedure I could opt to have a biopsy performed on the prostate to rule out BPH vs. cancer. They sent copies of everything to Dr. Anderson's. I contacted Dr. Anderson's office three times , three different days, and was told each time Dr. Anderson would review the material and call me back. Two times I was put on eternal hold and hung up on. When I didn't receive a call back (almost two weeks from my dog's emergency visit) I sought a new vet because the dog was off antibiotics for a week and appeared to have a UTI again. In two days I solidified a care and surgery plan for my dog  with the new vet. I called Dr. Anderson's to inquire when I was going to receive a call back. I got to speak with Dr. Anderson and he informed me he's been really busy (no apology). He looked at the documents from the vet hospital and tells me the document says to get the dog neutered. I informed him the document also suggests a biopsy. Dr. Anderson then informs me they don't perform biopsies and doesn't feel it's necessary.  I ask why it took so long to get this information and his reply was \""I don't know what to tell you\"".  I asked if I would have gotten faster service if I actually had an appointment and he said it probably would have been better. I ask him why his staff didn't suggest that in any of the three phone calls I made. Instead, I'm told by his staff that I would receive a call back that day. Sensing no concern or remorse,  I informed him I found a new vet and was no longer bring my dog to him because I've lost confidence. He proceeded to tell me I need to go where I'm most confident. Unreal !! No apology and no concern for my dog's well being. My dog is a pure bred. Both parents are grand champions. Unbelievable."
0,"Just moved to the area and came in here twice due to the convenient location.   The 1st time I came in, one of my shirts shrunk in laundry.  The 2nd time, one of my shirts came back with a tear in the arm.    I called to see if they would take care of it and they told me its a wear and tear issue.   Having only had this shirt for 6 months and never having an issue with my previous dry cleaner, I was certainly surprised to hear that.    For me it seems pretty clear cut that if a garment is damaged in your possession that you should replace it.    Given the experiences I had in my two trips to this location I certainly will not be going back and would definitely recommend avoiding this business."
1,"Stayed at the pallazo in mid June mid week\n\nCheck in was friendly and very helpful\n\nHowever if you have wifi in your room , the connection cuts in and out if you have an iPad. Same happens  to my friends Mac.\n\nThe suites are very spacious \n\nAnd the staff was friendly. \n\nThis place is missing a buffet but it's close enough to the Wynn and treasure island and the fashion shoes mall\n\n\nI would stay here again"
0,"Terrible service. \nThey made me return to my house twice because I was missing documents. I did called prior to ask what I needed and they misguided me. I tried to talk to the manager and he was a complete asshole.  I got a little discourage after going home twice without a car and still getting an attitude from the manager when I returned!\nThe manager was so rude that I ended up going to Savmore instead, got great service there, rented a car for 3 weeks, so I guess it's their lost... They not only lost that rental , they lost a costumer for life with me as I will NEVER deal with Advantage again nor EVER tell anyone to rent from them."
1,"Bobby C's is what a neighborhood pub is all about.  The fact that it serves up soul food and hosts some amazing music is icing on the cake.\n\nBut what makes the family owned and operated bar & lounge stand out is the fact that, from the minute you walk it, until you leave, you're treated like a member of their family. with in minuted we were joking and kidding around, a few minutes later, we were being given a tour of the facility, including their overflow seating next door.\n\nUntil now, it's been a hidden gem with a loyal following of people into live jazz and R&B, or this looking to sate their southern food cravings.  However, with a light rail stop outside, I predict it will be getting a whole lot more attention, (Hint: it is a must stop venue for any Light Rail pub crawls)"
1,"Cool park! Plenty of parking, gorgeous grounds, and lot's of green space. Everything was clean and well-kept, which can't be said about all parks. I enjoyed all the flowers and shade offered from the trees. I took my dog here for a walk and we had fun playing fetch on the open grass area. The LOVE also provided a great photo op:)"

I took in the ambiance--soothing music that suited the mood, wooden tables and chairs, TVs in good positions, and overall, it was a comfortable setting. The wait for my food was never too long either. These factors also held true the second time around. Now, here's what I've got to say about the food:\n\n- Red Velvet Pancakes: Now this, this is what a lot of people like to come for, so I had to try it. It really is a delicious stack. The ratio of whipped cream, to pancake, to cream cheese syrup is the key to the perfect bite of this dish! I do have a comment on it's consistency though. I prefer pancakes that are fluffy and melt in your mouth. These pancakes have a little bit of a chew to it but not enough to be drastically inedible. In fact, my peers didn't even notice. Otherwise, this alone is a great reason to come to BabyStacks!\n- Adobo Fried Rice: I love it and I couldn't stop eating it. It is flavorful and some might say it's a little salty, but that's just how I like it!\n- Country Fried Steak and Eggs: Nothing special, but still very tasty!\n\nBabyStacks is a great place to eat and definitely offers a lot of variety. Bring everyone with you!"
1,"i could go on and on about what a wonderful chiropractor Dr. Natalie is and you still would be amazed once you meet and are treated by her.  Not only is Dr. Natalie a amazing chiropractor, but a wonderful person.  She generally cares about her patience.  I feel so lucky that I met and was treated by her.  Not only do I have the best chiropractor in the valley, but a great friend as well.  \n\nThank you for all you are and all you do Dr. Natalie!!!"
0,"Having been on many amazing ziplone experiences in my life (including the one here before it was replaced) my hopes were high. However, this zipline was sooo slow, and we got stuck quite a ways from the finish and people had to come out and get us. I won't do it again."
1,"I love the layout of this store! The aisles are clean, set up in a classy fashion, and it even has a little eatery! (the eatery is pricey hot dogs, don't go.) It's mostly furniture, so it's excellent for remodeling your room! The only thing is that you make sure you inspect every facet of the furniture, because it's definitely buy as-is. It also has an outdoor section for salvage, or \""overflow\"", but it's generally not as good as the indoor stuff. The staff is very friendly though, and I definitely will keep shopping here."
1,"Every Indian in Las Vegas eats here. If you're not Indian and you want to eat where the Indians eat, this is it. It's the Bomb. and I don't mean Bay.\n\nEveryplace else is like the toilet that kid hid in in the movie Slumdog compared to this."
1,Swish is my favorite place for sukiyaki shabu shabu. The sukiyaki broth is so flavorful. You can make it how you want it. Get the rib eye sukiyaki. Another good place  to satisfy your soul.

0,"For an Alaine Ducasse restaurant, I expected so much more.\n\nThe decor - yes, at one time, it was probably stunning.  Now, however, it's tired and worn out.  The leather seats had cuts and the seams were coming apart.  Lots of scuffing on the \""booth\"" things.  \n\nThe service - mediocre.  No recommendations, no talking, no nothing.  Got the food, and that was about it.\n\nThe food - was ok.  Nothing fabulous.  Had the spicy crab appetizer, and that was probably the best item.  Had the fish, and it was so so...hubby had the filet, and it was ok.  Pretty hard to mess that up, though.\n\nI'd totally recommend someplace else..."
0,"I came here for the weekend brunch (8 dollars with my boarding pass discount).  This buffet was the worst I've been at in Vegas.  First of all, my taco shells were stale!  It tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for days!  I went to the egg station where I witnessed the egg cook make dozens of mistakes and discarded half a dozen eggs. After what felt like twenty minutes with three other people in front of me, I asked for poached eggs but the cook told me they didn't have an egg poacher and offered me steam eggs instead.  A few minutes later, I received two runny undercooked steamed eggs.  I should have known this cook didn't know how to cook eggs since he kept asking the customers if the eggs looked cooked enough before he took them off the stove. \n\nMost of the food were borderline edible and just plain bad.  The only things I liked here were their desserts (lemon meringue, cheese danish, etc.).  It's just a shame that the people who run this buffet doesn't care or know what good food is.  It also appears that the staff is overworked.  For example, there should have been two egg cooks.\n\nThis buffet makes me think twice about returning to the Palace station hotel because I don't like paying for food cooked with no love or experience.  Don't come here, save your money."

1,"My fiance and I LOVE this place!  We were visiting my parents for Christmas and found a great deal on golfnow.  I've been playing for a year, Sean has been playing forever.  The course was super challenging, as in narrow fairways, lots of homes on both sides, and desert landscaping that is a magnet for golf balls (at least mine).  \n\nThe starter was AMAZING.  he drove us out to the 1st tee, gave us detailed descriptions and tips about the course, where the bathrooms are, etc.  We even got free drink coupons to use when the cart lady came around.  \n\nThe customer service was better than my game (even thought I golfed my best game yet!).  I cannot wait to come back!!!!!!\n\nI wish courses in the bay area were like this place...."
0,"review for casino floor ONLY.  dark dark dark.  i remember reading when it opened, how light and bright it was inside the casino floor.  NO it's not.  very dark throughout.  again, oddly shaped -- just one long corridor with slots and tables.  more dark than Red Rock...and Red Rock is pretty dark inside.  spacing just seems off and thrown together.  i don't know."

0,"Absolutely go here if you want to be belittled and embarrassed. The male employee that we had the unfortunate luck of speaking with was so rude. We walked in to check in and he was already in a bad mood. \n\nHe spoke down to us the whole time. He looked up our number and had an attitude about asking our names. He made us feel embarrassed to even be in the place. There were a couple of other customers waiting, who I hope walked out as we did. \n\nWe ended up going somewhere else and were treated much better and got cheaper haircuts that we love. I hope this location takes a closer look at the attitudes of their employees and decides to revamp their employment options."
1,"Wow, what a nice trendy place to get a few bites and drinks before hitting the club! I came on a Thursday night and this place was definitely 'poppin' with people.\n\n Myself + two decided to sit at the bar due to the quicker service.  This was only my second time here and it had been years since my first visit. A lot of tapas to choose from, creating a great variety! The prices were also very inexpensive, which already puts this place on my good list. The other 2 weren't too hungry so they opted to order a few drinks while choosing to nibble on calamari. However, I came with an empty stomach so I choose the Thai Beef Salad which sounded very appetizing at the moment. The calamari was pretty standard and would satisfy anyone's craving for this fried seafood appetizer. However, the Thai Beef salad was basically a salad with beef. Nothing in it made it Thai other than the name. \n\nOther than the so so salad, definitely a great experience and will be coming here more often with friends before getting our dance on at the club."
1,"Food - 2/2\n*I got the South Crunch burger and it was amazing.  A 1/2 burger with pimento cheese, jjalapeno bacon, onions, and hand-cut chips on the burger!  Wow.  Portions are very generous.\n\nService - 1/1\n*No complaints\n\nPrice - 1/1\n*$10-15, what you'd expect\n\nAtmosphere - 1/1\n*Sat out on the patio for Sunday brunch and it was really nice.\n\nHave to be honest, went to the area trying to go the Tupelo Honey Cafe and the wait was too long for 2 little kids and so we ended up at The Liberty.  We were pleasantly surprised.  This is a really good place that we really enjoyed.  I'd go back!"
1,Had a great time. Great service.  Too bad its in Snobdale I mean Scottsdale.  Some 60+ old man killed it for me while he was attempting to hit on me in front of his wife and my husband and son. Can't wait for the Gilbert location to open (where we live) to get away from the Scottsdale vide!!!
0,"My wife and I would go to the one near our old place every so often.  I know its a chain restaurant , but on occasion they have a meal that just has some great flavor , so why not. \n\nWe have been to this particular restaurant , and both times H O R R I B L E service. \nThe first time , we did not get our soup or salad , and the waitress was very few and far between on the drink refills.  Anyone that knows me , knows i suck down iced tea like its going out of style.  Sometimes i even have them bring me 2 glasses of it.    I think i got 1 refill the entire time.... needless to say there was a drought . \n\n2nd time it was gorgeous outside , so we decided to sit outside. .... BAD IDEA.  Same issue with the waitress ,  very little checking up on us.  She was not even the one who brought us our food.   On top of that , they charged me for 3 of the 2 for 15 dollar meals instead of just 2 .....  no apology , no discount , no free dessert ... no nothing.  Just a 15 minute wait to get it fixed. And on our way . \n\n\nI have sent a correspondence to the corporate office , and it has been nearly a month and have not heard anything back.  Obviously they don't care about their clientele."
0,"I was hearing the buzz about Cafe Zupas for a while and thought I'd check it out the other day. Was definitely not impressed and it didn't live up to its expectations. \nI decided to get a soup and sandwich. When I went up to order my soup I asked to try the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla, the young lady allowed me to try it yet when I actually ordered it she said there wasn't any left. Why did she let me try it in the first place? Then I proceeded to order  the Pesto Chicken sandwich, which barely had any chicken. There was nowhere to sit, and the tables which were available were dirty. I'll be sticking to Panera from now on."
1,"Good location for tempe marketplace. Far away from all the craziness and traffic aka much easier to get to than bevmo. Other than that it's your typical total wine. The second I walked in a staff member asked me if he could help me find something, and when they didn't have what I was looking for he redirected me to something similar. He knew what he was talking about, and even gave me a little lesson in champagne- Rose to be exact."
1,I love this place. The owners are so friendly and actually came to talk with my friends and I. Love their gyro
1,"My brother, his girlfriend and I went here and were so impressed. The couple who run the center were knowledgeable, friendly and so helpful. They have a true passion for inspiring people to be climbers. As a novice, I found many routes  I enjoyed and challenged me. I highly recommend this gym!"
1,Tiffany was amazing! She was on time and ready to roll before we even had our hair done. She listened to what we wanted and provided exactly that. Her makeup job perfectly complemented my features and made me look even more beautiful. Highly recommended.
1,"amazing food but book ahead, really long wait for a table otherwise"
1,"Good for dates, good for a quick eat, good for family- it's a pretty well-balanced restaurant.  Service is great, decor is stunning, everything is just right.  \n\nThe reason why I'm giving Hachi 4 stars is because establishments that I give 5 stars to usually have a \""wow, oh holy %^&\"" factor that applies to them.  When I gave it to Parasol Up, it was because of the ambiance and crowd it managed to maintain every time I went there.  For Tao, it was the experience I got.  Bradley Ogden, their food.  But here at Hachi, everything is just.. good.  Not great.  Good.\n\nI've been to Hachi many times and as with many restaurants out their, they've catered to our slumbering economy by dumbing down their menu.  They now have a section in the menu that features small, tapas-type dishes for people who aren't too hungry or that on a very strict budget.  The sushi is still very good; they have a sushi roll with mango on top which I think everyone should try... when mango is in season :)"
0,"We ate here tonight as we always do when we come to Vegas (7 or 8 times previously) and the service was good, but the food was horrible; tasteless chicken, horrid calamari, and the pasta was the worst with sauce that seemed to not be fresh and big hunks of cheese in it. We are here until Sunday and will definitely not be coming back to eat here, if ever. And to find out they are closing this Sunday for good."
0,"I was told this was a good a place for tacos in the area, but I was very disappointed  since a stepped in the front door. The entire place was dirty, service was poor and food was tasteless. the only good thing they have is their hot salsas. overall Gross!"
1,"Woah. Thank goodness for yelp. That's how I learned about this breakfast gem. The boy just moved to PA so we went out foraging for breakfast, but before I did, I did a quick Yelp search. We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews. \n\nThere were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude. \n\nThe seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less). \n\nThe menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up. \n\nThe other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while. \n\nI think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's."
0,"Wal-mart?  Yes, this place is just like shopping at Wal-mart - the annoying door greeter, the predominantly \""rural\"" customers, the lack of service in some of the departments, and yet rock bottom prices on many items.\n\nWorst aspect is the handgun counter where you'll be ignored, even if you try to get the staff's attention with waving hands.  Lines form here just to look at handguns, and even if you have cash in hand you may be ignored and so frustrated that you'll go somewhere else and just pay the $30 more for that same handgun.\n\nBackorder & in-store delivery needs improvement.  While some of my backordered items arrived, the others remained on backorder.  I received no email update for a few weeks, and then an impatient caller from Cabelas telling me my order has been sitting there for a month and demanded to know when I would pick it up.  Yes, I'm serious."
1,"Awesome, some of the best thai food I've ever had.  The owner is usually working and is an awesome guy.  The panang curry is some of my favorite ever.  Every dish I've had was great, and you have to try the fried cheesecake! omnom!"
1,"Great food with great flavor, nice place to have a romantic dinner, I had the paella with was delicious but my girlfriend had the lamb which I thought I would have order that too. The waiter was very polite and always there if we needed something I would definitely go back and try some other foods on there menu."
1,"Chocolate. Yum. Free samples of delicious chocolate? DOUBLE YUM. \n\nAND A FREE TRUFFLE FOR CHECKING IN ON YELP? Like oh my gosh, everyone put your hands up! and say yeaahh :) \n\nOpted for the Himalayan pink sea salt and goji berries milk chocolate bar. Omgosh my mom and I are officially addicted to that bar. Tried the funk and disco truffle - it tastes like banana pudding in milk chocolate. Yummy! \n\n* note to self: must get more of their bars from whole foods :)"
1,This place is hidden behind a gym and Pan Asian which could be a contributing factor as to why it's not super duper busy.. I love how the space is clean and not janky looking like most threading places. When I walked in I was immediately greeted by a nice smiling man who offered me bottled water. While you wait you can sip on some coffee from their cool coffee machine and watch Bollywood movies on their flat screen or you can browse the many perfumes and purses that have for sale. There were 2 ladies working so the wait was short. I got the same lady as last time but I forgot her name ;[[[ She's so sweet and did exactly what I asked her to do with my brows! Prices are your standard threading prices- $10 for brows.\n\nHOT TIP: Don't forget to ask for a loyalty stamp card ~!!!
0,"Yeah, overpriced, chocolate flavored water = hot chocolate from the Bellagio Caf\u00e9.    If you're looking for hot chocolate the best place I've found is the Coffee Bean inside Planet Hollywood.   Go get your cocoa there and then walk over to the fountains and enjoy."
1,broccoli and egg omelet was delicious! i think it cost 12.00 so it was reasonable. the waiter brought out delicious glasses of tap water to go with it!\n\nhash browns were acceptable./ nothing to brag about. wheat toast was standard\n\nthis place exceeded my expectations for 3:00 a.m. on a saturday morning in vegas. no wait to be seated and plenty of tables. lots of staff working too\n\ni would go back.
1,"We recently bought a mid-century house and had no furniture for a couple of the rooms. We went to the Rubin's Clearance Center and happened to catch their moving sale, which meant that everything was marked down below their normal clearance price. Nice! You won't pay Ikea prices, but this is, for the most part, high-quality stuff. Real leather, real wood (for most items), etc. There are a few with scratches and dents, and many items are floor models, but for the most part, that doesn't bother me. We got a really good deal on a chair that apparently someone had ordered but came with the wrong fabric. We also left with a shelf/storage unit/drawer thing, a desk, and a rolling chair. The manager threw in a few gift-y items I had picked out, too. \n\nThe downside is, the salesperson (not the manager), kept reminding us that it was \""20 minutes until closing time.\"" This started a half hour before (believe me, I used to work in retail, and I know the \""oh, you have a half hour before we close\"" trick). We were out of there ten minutes before they closed, so it's not like we were making them stay late. If you're making commission on a sale which could be several thousand dollars (it ended up under 2K, but still), you shouldn't be pushing people out the door. I might have picked up a couple of other items if I hadn't felt rushed out."
1,I stopped in for the open house tonight. It was a very nicely done opening event. Lots of raffles and friendly staff. I've done a sample class at the paradise valley location and it was intense and fun!  I'd consider joining soon!
0,"Worst pedicure ever! Went in there for the first time yesterday afternoon. They were busy but still had plenty of chairs open for pedicures. My friend and I got seated right away and everything seemed great. Then the nail tech handed me the card to pick out which pedicure I wanted. The \""regular\"" is $19 and includes \""nail trimming, brief massage, basic nail color.\"" The only other option was a $40 one with callus remover, scrub and paraffin wax. Kind of ridiculous that they only have two options with such big price differences. All other nail places I've been to at least include hot stone and a decent massage in their basic pedicure. I chose the regular with no extras. The nail tech seemed annoyed by that and totally rushed through everything. The lotion \""massage\"" was pretty much just her slapping some lotion on my legs. We were out of there in about a half hour, which is the shortest time I've ever been in a nail salon for a pedicure. The nail tech did not thank us for our business and did not ask to see us again.. so I will never go back again!"
1,Excellent food at great prices!
1,"Tried out a Smashburger closer to us after going to the SB Yelp event across town. Our experience at the restaurant was just as impressive on a \""regular\"" day. They willingly took our coupons from the Yelp event even though they were marked as being from the location across town. Helpful staff who were all friendly and appeared to be in good moods. Tasty food, all good. I love the smash fries and fried pickles are on the \""secret\"" menu I think. The burgers are good without being too heavy, and it is easy to customize what you want. When you don't have time for a sit down burger but don't want to hit McD's or BK, this is a great option."
0,"Don't wrinkle your nose at me, young woman!\nIt's bad enough to not smile at customers, but to look at them as though they're something slightly puzzling that has blown in under the door really isn't the best customer service. I wondered if I had jam round my mouth, or twigs in my hair, but no, my companions got much the same look when they arrived. And an underwhelming apology when they had to send coffee back for being cold. \nSo - it's a nice wee cafe, the coffee was good (when it was hot) and the croissant delicious. But the customer service leaves a bit to be desired."
1,"The burger patties are worth the 5 bucks. They look small, but are really thick and filling :) I know I thought it was too little and wasn't enough but ended up being pretty full after. \n\nI've gone here twice!  I've tried the Buta-burger and karai.\n\nButa-burger: for some reason, I felt like it was really salty, but the sweet like sauce made up for it.\n\nKarai- As my first burger, I thought it was pretty good (though I think I got too excited over it). It was just some special spicy sauce and some cucumber. Ehh\n\nA bit of the Tamago--I loved it. It made me regret every burger I've had so far with fuku burger...it was so delicious. :( I almost was tempted to go buy it, but was already filled! DEFINITELY TRY IT FIRST! I cheated myself out by not trying it my first time. \n\nNext time I plan on getting those delicious fries I've heard rumors about and the Tamago! And we'll see then!"
0,Poor customer service from this restaurant that shares space with a Circle K. Chicken was flavorless and some pieces were over cooked. Our order took nearly 15 minutes to put together because they were filling other orders while they waited for enough fries to complete our order. They did offer compensation but only after we complained about the six counter orders they filled while we waited. We have no idea how many drive thru orders were filled in that time frame. We used to think customer service was poor in New Jersey. The greater Phoenix area is worse by far.
0,"Upgrade to one star based on the fact that we did eventually get resolution to our issue.  And now the details...\nWe made the mistake of not looking up this store on Yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center (The Dump).  We found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.  We had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.  Next, how to get this set into our kitchen.  We had two options: 1. have it delivered for a fee or 2. pick it up.  Well, I had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set, so I wanted to do that.  What's that you say?  I have to go way out to the Avenues to pick it up?  Hogwash!  We opted to pay delivery and not have to don our Kevlar vests to make the pickup.  (OK, I favor the East Valley- sue me).  \nThat is where things went sideways.  \nThe \""warehouse\"" folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery, which concerned me as that was the one thing I was promised as the time was a range.  No call within a couple hours of delivery so I called the store, who got me the warehouse number.  When I called, I was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.  I confirmed the address and they had the wrong name AND address.  They were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the WV.  They rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 5:00PM when we had a morning delivery scheduled.  \nUpon assembly, they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.  There were two issues: 1. one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 1/2\"" shorter than the rest.  The second issue was in relation to a bench that came with the set.  It had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it, leaving a depression that was pretty severe.  We gave it 24 hours to even out, but it didn't.  We then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the bench so she can make sure ACME (the manufacturer) would do a replacement.  Instead, we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.  The customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.  He ordered new legs for the chair and another bench.  The legs came into the store, and I picked those up but there would be a wait for the bench.  Again, they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.  When I called the warehouse to confirm again, I was told that they ALWAYS call.  I begged to differ but again, she was skeptical.  By the time we got the replacement bench delivered, nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.  Notably, the new bench cushions looked a little different than the other (it was much less loosely covered).\n\nOverall, the store experience was decent (at least I was told what they thought that I wanted to hear), the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on Yelp."
0,"What a disappointment! Cold, unidentifiable, fried things on the plate next to a\n\""lump\"" of average ground stuff, Stacked nearly 5 inches high to give the impression of large.

0,I've had really bad experience with this particular dealership. It is not the way they greeted me or the way they treated me but it is the way that they overcharged an overpriced each item that I was supposed to have done to my car. Not only did they tell me the wrong price is for the items that needed to be repaired but they ordered the wrong parts also. They told me that items needed to be repaired the head only been repaired a week prior buy them and expected eight thousand dollars to repair items that were repaired for under $800. \n\nIs my opinion that this dealership take advantage of people who are not mechanically inclined or old people do not know what things are really wrong with your car. \n\nI truly feel sorry for someone who goes there and does not have any automotive experience. I know that they will take advantage of someone.
1,"I have been coming to the WomanCare Clinic for years and I have never once had anything less than a great experience. I see Mary Bina-Frymark NP and I cannot recommend her enough. She manages to be no nonsense while also being very compassionate. She has helped me through many medical problems and has gone above and beyond to help me when I had an emergency. \nIn addition to Mary, I have also had wonderful experiences with all of the other nurses there. I really can't say enough wonderful things about this place. I recommend it to all of my female friends and I will never go anywhere else so long as I live in Madison."
1,My first impression....wasn't too good as it looked not so good...they really should fix up the place.\nThe food on the other hand...great vegetarian menu....dosa was tasty. Had also dahl with rice...very good. They even have choices of chutney. I do recommend to anyone....even meat eaters.
1,"Roller coaster.... Good!!!!    In fact, amazing.\n\nLocation of said roller coaster... Even more fabulous.\n\nLocation of hotel... Not so good.  Especially when you've dressed nice with your lady pals and head on out to the strip.  3 hours later and 30 propositions from strange weirdos later, we finally made it to Caesars palace.  \n\nAlthough I had a great time next time I'd book a place closer to wherever the action is (bellagio, Caesars palace).  The upside is it does have free parking below!!"

0,"This is probably the most appalling buffet I've ever seen in Las Vegas! Do not eat here! The quality is abysmal at best and the food is dry and has sat on the bar a bit too long. The customer service along with the decor is ok, but I would definitely love to be at the MGM sipping on mimosas with creme brulee and meaty crab legs."
1,Fun and Delicious. Another fantastic restraunt not in Goodyear.
0,The only reason Phoenix New times is still around is because it's free. Their strip club supporters and ads is whats keeping them in business.  No one with any common sense would buy Phx new times paper if it was for sale.\n\n They call anyone who is against illegal immigration. Bigots.  lol \n\n The only good story i read on Phx new times is the story about lifelock.com. How it is a scam and that the owners ID was stolen many times. I guess showing your SSN on national TV is a good way to become a victim of ID theft.\n\nother than that. story after story about how much they hate Sheriff Joe and all anti illegal people.
0,"Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues, but apparently it's R&B night or Jazz night or something.  They play some old school CDs really loud so it's hard to maintain a decent conversation.  On top of that, it's old school CDs bc the music would skip.  We asked them to turn it down (off) and their response was: It's R&B night.  Uh, so who cares? Literally, there was us and 2 old cougars sitting at the bar - that's about it. Note: We were not sitting with these cougars, but the amount of times they were looking over at our table, I thought it was feeding time - feeling like a piece of meat, sheesh!  Hardly a R&B night if you ask me!  Beers were fine, I liked the multitude of screens.  But it's so dead on Thursday bc of Jazz Night!  Just giving them a heads up, let's trash that idea, yeah? :)  \n\nLol, 2 other corporate dudes walked in, was looking around, saw cougars + music skipping and peaced out.  We totally should have done that.\n\ndmo out."
0,"This place is not good and not worth the prices. I suggest you drive up the street to In-N-Out and save yourself some $$\n\nThe burger menu is over hyped and Smashburger doesn't deliver. Please don't use truffle mayo and call the burger a truffle burger. You are not Umami.\n\nThe buns here are soggy and gross, and the meat here is tasteless. Don't go here."
1,"Always great food, drinks & energy! If you are at the Fashion Show Mall this place is worth your visit. Good margaritas and yummy food! Their special events are excellent too. I have not had a chance to go to the cooking events but I have wanted to. It was fun to do Cinco de Mayo here!"
0,"I heard great things about this place. The reviews raved about the chicken fried steak. However, I had a horrible experience there. It might be because I went there at 5, and they weren't prepped for dinner yet?  My friend ordered the stuffed chicken and I ordered the chicken fried steak. They just ran out of soup, and since we were both in the mood for New England Clam Chowder, we opted to wait 15 minutes. They brought us coffee that we didn't order. We didn't get any of our food because we chose to wait for the soup. My friend had ordered onion rings, which we hoped they would bring early, but alas they did not. Her stuffed chicken was dry and lukewarm. My chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes were lukewarm as well. The steak was crunchy and it might have been better if it were steaming hot. The waitress ending up forgetting about the onion rings which were amazing. They were hot and crunchy and delicious! I only wish the rest of my meal was just as amazing. \n\nFor our dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and the chocolate lava cake- both a la mode. However, they premake the dessert, leave it on display, and warm it up.  The cake was kind of dry. The bread pudding was pretty yummy. \n\nWe both signed up on yelp to become a member to get a free coffee and bear claw. However, neither of us got the e-mail which isn't this store's fault, but a fault of yelp?\n\nTwo tables came in after us and we left later than them. I understand that we opted to wait for our soup. However, we spent two hours in that diner!"
1,"My husband and I have enjoyed this pub the last two visits to Vegas. The food is good and a tad bit pricey. I had the chicken parm sliders with a side of sweet potato fries and my husband ordered the bologna sandwich. Both were delicious. The selection of beer is impressive, we both had a pint of Killkenny. Mmmmmmm!! The only negative that I would say about the whole experience was the guy at the bar who was very loud and every other word out of his mouth was vulgar. Normally, we would not be bothered but he was standing about a foot away and made it tricky to enjoy great food and great beer. Oh well.....we will return and enjoy the pub again."
0,"Not worth the price. I felt rushed as the two ladies working simultaneously on my hands and feet were massaging so fast like they were trying to win a contest who would get done faster. I can go a block away and get paraffin soak added for less price. This is Charlotte not New York, so if you are going to charge more, then you need to up the quality of service as well."
1,"Always come here for Spaghetti and Meatballs on Monday and Tuesday.  You can't mess up noodles, and the sauce is good and the meatballs are really good.  Great place to dine out if you are on a budget or need a break from over paying at other places.  Service is good if not a little slow, but that's because the place is usually packed to the ceilings on the days we go."
1,"I love this place. They are always friendly, the cheese curds are the best as well as the chicken tenders.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison."
1,"The Smashburger Sin City burger is the best in Vegas.  Addictive, and not diet food, but definitely delicious and worth the price and the trip."
1,"Great food... Great Service... Nice attention to details & a wide variety of food options.  I would sure love some organic choices to be added & some grass fed, stage four, no hormone, no antibiotic meat at some if the nice Las Vegas restaurants... Hope we see that soon!!!"
1,"Awesome place to stay.  We arrived late due to a flight delay and they had already given our room away.  The woman at reception apologized and then proceeded to upgrade us with a bigger room with the best view of the strip (in my opinion). \n\nThe pools were why we decided to stay here and we weren't disappointed.  Two small pools, a lazy river, and a large wave pool (only one wave every five or ten minutes though). The pool vibe was much tamer than I expected.  Daylight (day pool party) was going strong, but steep cover charge.  \n\nGreat food options around the casino. The bars inside were pricey, but to be expected.  Overall, this was a great place to stay and would come back."
0,"Als Gesch\u00e4ftsreisender kann ich keine Empfehlung aussprechen.

0,"This is the worst golf course I've ever played on.  It was only $15 in the afternoon during the summer, and I still felt ripped off.  The greens were atrocious, most of them on the front nine had large dirt spots all over them and you could hardly tell where the green ended and the fringe began.  Everything here is old, and not in a vintage/antique way but in a terribly maintained way.  You'd be better off not golfing at all than playing here."
0,"This was my second time dining at Company. And unfortunately, it will probably be the last. Maybe that's not fair. I'll explain.\n\nI first dined at Company back in June. My party of six was seated by a waiter and looked after very attentively by three support servers clad all black pants, collared shirts and aprons. I felt a little under-dressed. The menu was upscale comfort food. My friend Katie gave me part of her delicious lobster BLT. My friend Colton gave me two spoonfuls of deliciously creamy mashed potatoes and the best creamed spinach I have ever had. I had the special that night, which was the jambalaya. It was fantastic. And there was so much of it, I couldn't even finish it all. Overall, I had a great experience and vowed to return.\n\nOver Thanksgiving weekend, I found out that a friend and I  would be staying at the Luxor for the Criss Angel show Believe (see that review before you go). I quickly made reservations for Company. I couldn't wait to show off this place that I \""knew\"". And I wore a jacket and nice shoes this time too. \n\nThe restaurant looked exactly the same as it did in June. Only now the waiters were clad in black t-shirts that had the word \""Company\"" silkscreened across them. The very friendly waiter asked if I had dined here before. I proudly told him \""Yes. Last June.\"" To which he said \""Oh. So you were here before our concept change.\"" Concept change? Uh boy. He continued his rotely memorized patter \""What our concept is now is that we take classic Western dishes and we combine them with Eastern ingredients to deliver small tasting plates with great variety.\"" My heart and stomach sank. \""So this is like an East/West tapas menu? Right?\"" To which he said \""I'm glad you said that. That's a very good way of describing it.\"" I checked in with my friend. It wasn't a deal breaker for him. So we soldiered on.\n\nThe menu is divided into four sections: Sea, Sky, Land and Earth. We both ordered an item from each category.\n\nSEA: Seared Tuna w/ lemon, olive oil, wasabi greens - There was so little of this dish, I barely remember it.\nLumb Crab Gratin w/shitake mushroom, bacon, leek and cotija cheese- This was really good. I'd like another portion of this. And to top it off, it was served in the same cast iron gratin dish that they used to serve the creamed spinach in. WHERE ARE YOU CREAMED SPINACH?\n\nSKY: Organic Duck Confit Potstickers- They were okay. I've never understood why you would hide duck confit in a potsticker that you are going to dip in a sauce.\nChicken Breast w/mushroom ragout- The Eleanor Rigby  of this menu\n\nLAND: SoHo Kobe Beef Slider- Very good. But their current prevalence on so many gastropub menus didn't make me feel like it was anything terribly special. \nFilet of Beef w/brandy cream and melted leek- Good. Not really sure what a melted leek is though, either before or after I ate it.\n\nEARTH: Gruyere Cheese Puffs w/chive creme fraiche and lobster oil- On the dry side. This was the one dish that remained the longest on the table due to neither of us fighting over it.\nChili Garlic Asparagus- Really good. Strands of baby asparagus. Glad it came out with the steak too.\n\nOverall, it was good food. After finishing all of the entrees, the waiter asked if we were still hungry. I answered with a qualified YES. He offered to bring the menu back. But I was thinking more about walking across the street to the Dan Marino Steakhouse at Hooters. Now THERE'S fine dining ;-). I capped off the meal with a dessert of Earl Grey chocolate cake with almond ice cream. SOOOOOO TINY. \n\nI guess I'd go to Company again. But I'd only bring a certain group of people with me. Their concept change has radically changed my concept of dining there. Good place for foodies to knock off a bunch of plates. Bad place for someone who hasn't eaten since the Chick-Fil-A four hours away in Upland, California."
0,"Not impressed. Front desk competency is inconsistent. At busy times the staff is visibly overwhelmed. I've had to go back twice because of their mistakes. Too bad Sonora has a monopoly. Competition would be a good thing for them and the consumer. The customer should not have to observe or hear their comments when assignment overload occurs. The billing procedures are strange. They send out separate bills for each test. They have yet to figure out how to put all the charges on one sheet. Just when you think you've paid all the charges, more are mailed out separately. A negative rating would fit Sonora just nicely."
0,"I used to come here with my girlfriend (now wife) back in the late 90's, but I don't know what has happened since - has my taste changed, has the resto had new owners? I don't know, but what was once a good experience has dried up and has blown away. First of all, the Jappy clientele are really annoying and grating to have to listen too while trying to unwind, but what can you do about that? Not the resto's fault, just another nail in the coffin for me though.\nThe server we had was alright, she did her job, but so indifferent and impersonal it was a little offensive. Every time she spoke to us, she would say something rehearsed, but pleasant, but never made eye contact. She would be gawking at another table, anything but us. Rude in any culture.\nWe ordered a pitcher of sangria - not hard to make. But it had little alcohol and was all ice cubes and obviously tasted like water - stale bar water. Returned it as it was $22 and got a little attitude for it. The pizza was alright. It cam on a mozza like bread and had very little toppings. The cheese was scarce as was the meat, and the taste was nothing to write home about. I had to drown it in the spicy oil they give you for it to be any good. It was an awful choice as it was a rare night out away from our daughter and we blew it here at this place. The bill was pretty steep for a pizza that probably cost them a dollar to make, so that was the last time we go to Pizzadelic. All the spicy oil in the world wouldn't make us go back."
1,"Beautiful condo-like rooms. In fact, if i'm not mistaken, it was intended to be a condominium-type complex. I was lucky enough to go for a business meeting and rooms were already discounted--so I didn't have to deal with the price. As far as comfort level is concerned, the rooms are spacious and have everything you could possibly need. \n\nA few things I didn't like: \n-dimly lit room (not good for work, or putting on makeup)\n-balcony did not open so it was like a tease to have such a great view on the 36th floor (i'm sure this has to do with legal reasons though)\n-very expensive bottled waters (really expect anything different in vegas?)\n-distance from the strip (you have to take a shuttle from the Gold coast or a $10 cab ride)\n-distance from the other two Palms towers (it often felt like a trek)\n-expensive one-time admission to the Gym even if you are a hotel guest ($30--seriously?)"
0,"We order 2 plates chilly chicken, but it is so hard to find chicken in it.  They cooked it with 75% of onions,  capsicum and 25% of chicken.  They should change dish name, it should be \""chilly capsicum\"" instead of \""chilly chicken\"".  Worst dish!!! \n\nDon't ever order chilly chicken here."
1,Great stone crabs in dinner buffet. Great selection. Great apple cooler. Try the salmon. Bad pasta and pizza. Bad sushi.
1,"We came back here for Christmas dinner. I had the goat cheese crepes. Oh man. Absolutely delicious. I devoured the entire plate before I even realized it (and it's a large portion). It was buttery and decadent and topped with fresh greens and tomatoes. My family also shared the daily farm to table salad, which was a warm kale salad with mozzarella and a crunchy root vegetable I forget the name of...celeriac or rutabaga maybe? It was similar to a radish in texture. The salad was delicious, though. Gotta love when kale is cooked well. \n\nI got another barrelhouse roulette cocktail. This time it was a martini called a Nebuchadnezzar (awesome name). I know it was gin-based and I think it had chocolate and orange bitters. I can't remember exactly, but it was yummy and very strong. \n\nLove this place!"
0,"Not a great lunch. Yeah, they slice the meats, but they must be the poorest quality meat in all the land by the looks of the turkey that was being sliced for the overweight woman in front of me. They were also slapping fresh microwaved bacon on her sandwich and the young sandwich maker had trouble handling the stuff because it was nuked too much. Staying away from the crappy meats saved me a bunch of heartburn, but the safe veggie choice was equally a failure. I guess the zesty parmesan bread was good enough, but all the cheese was processed slices and the lettuce was wet and all the other veggies just didn't have any excitement. Not even \""The Blimpie Way\"" of a an oil and vinegar bath helped. The dirty rag that was used to clean the prep area was also kind of unappetizing. Only positive factory was the price of 5 bucks for a 12 inch sub. Probably should have bailed, but hadn't been to a Blimpie in decades and now I won't ever feel the urge to go back again."
0,I give it 1star because the crab cakes were horrible and smelt nasty & tasted disgusting.the waitress said it was normal but how! please fix.
1,"First off, I have eaten at 3 different Dillon's now since I moved here a year ago--and I love Dillon's food.  It seems so \""clean\"" and American really.\nAnyway, went there for lunch with a friend. \nBeautiful setting when you look out, but...listen, I'm old myself, but there is something creepy about eating with a bunch of 80-something year olds around you.  Even I can't get into that...and, like I said, I'm a retired geezer myself.\nHowever, the food was so good as ever.  And excellent service as per usual...in fact, probably even better than normal cause, well, we're geezers."
1,"It's great here! I go mainly for the classes, and I've pretty much enjoyed all the ones I've taken. I would have given them a 5/5 except they've occasionally cancelled classes on short notice. I've learned to check thier calendar online before I head out to make sure it's still scheduled, they seem to be pretty good at updating it with changes. \n\nThey have a movie theater in the gym where they play movies during certain times, the lights are dim, and they have a bunch of machines. It's pretty awesome and unique to any of the other gyms I researched before joining. Also, they have a daycare area. I don't have children, but I imagine that would be a nice perk. \n\nAnyway, this is a gym I'd definitely recommend."
1,Great food and great service. The chicken enchiladas suiza was delicious!
0,"At one time Mario's was the place to go in the southside, when it was the only thing in the southside.  But now the food is below average and it's just for a place for drunk immature assholes. There are better places to go now."
1,"Anyone who loves the arts would like this place a lot. \n\nThe staff were very friendly and kindly explained to me that everything they have including the arts and crafts, coffee beans, and deserts are all made/ grown locally. \n\nThey do have a dining area with Wi-Fi, and it's usually pretty quiet. FABO is a great place to chill or get some work done in a cozy, art-filled environment."
0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I don't think this was our servers fault entirely, but everything that could have possibly been wrong with a dining experience happened at this place.  I have never been to another Chart House location but I have been to other Landry's restaurants with mixed results.  This place however was one of the worst experiences I've had in a long time.  \nMy girlfriend and I came here because it was down the road from the hotel we're staying at and they offer 1000 point reservations on Open Table.  We had reservations at 8:45 at night so I guess maybe they were wrapping up for the night but for the prices they charge I would expect the same level of service anytime they are open.\nWe were seated and our server Joe took our orders promptly.  We both ordered dirty gin martinis and bread was brought out promptly afterwards.  We also ordered oysters when we place our drink orders.  After a good 10 minutes we got our oysters which is reasonable for an appetizer order, but still no drinks.  After eating all of our bread and starting to eat our oysters we were still left without our drink orders.  Finally after I would say was 15 to 20 minutes we received our drinks.  I ordered my martini with blue cheese stuffed olives which weren't available at the time so he brought out regular olives until they could be made which was fine.  However he made my martini completely different from the other martini (it was made \""perfect\"" which i guess is equals part gin and vermouth).  He did ask if I wanted it remade and I said I would give it a try since I didn't know how long it would be until I received another drink.  During this time it looked like he was the only server left on with 4 tables left to serve so I am not sure if this was the servers fault or the bartenders in regards to how long it took get my drink but that long of wait and to have it come out wrong is inexcusable.   And that was just the drinks.   \nWe place our orders for dinner and I ordered the large cut of the prime rib and the salad bar while my girlfriend ordered a side caeser salad and an appetizer.  I went and had the salad bar which was actually pretty descent.  I would even go as far as saying the salad bar was the highlight of the meal but I can get that at golden corral.  I proceeded to eat my salad since at this point we probably there for 30 minutes and at that point only had just received our drinks and had bread and oysters.  I finished my salad bar plate and my girlfriend had to wait another 10 minutes before receiving her salad.  The entire timing of how they brought our food was pretty poor overall.  \nAfter finishing our salads, they brought out our entrees.  I ordered the 18oz prime rib medium rare and my girlfriend ordered an appetizer that had raw ahi tuna and tuna tartare.  Her food actually looked somewhat appetizing and was somewhat tasty.  My prime rib however was nowhere remotely close to be cooked medium rare.  I understand I ordered a large cut of prime rib but it was brought out almost 90% well done through out.   I'm not sure if at the time of plating it was cooked like that or it had sat there for a while and thats why it was so well done but it no way is it ever acceptable to bring out a cut of meat so far from what you ordered.  It would be one thing if maybe it was medium or medium well but this was definitely well done.   At this point I almost was going to tell the server to not even bother to bring me another one because again I had no idea how long it would take to receive my food again.  I brought it to the attention of my server and he assured me it shouldn't take very long since it was medium rare.  It was brought out shortly after and the prime rib was close to medium rare.  It was OKAY.  Nothing to write home about.  \nIn the end we received our bill which was $128, which would be just fine for a descent meal somewhere but for our experience was not even remotely worth the money.   Our server was nice enough but i think he just didn't have support from managers, bartenders, or the kitchen.  Overall I would say this was one of the poorest restaurant experiences I've had in a while.  I would say avoid this place like the plague.  Too bad because it is convenient location with a good atmosphere."
1,Love this store !!!! Been going for years and I love the variety of shoes and the price is amazing ! A must try for shy shoe lover
0,"Poor customer service!!!! If you see  a lot of people waiting there, it does not exactly mean that the place is good. It is probably because the waiters don't give a F*** about the customers that come in. After 10 min of waiting to be sited,  we finally got a good spot. BUT after 5 minutes the waiter demanded us ( not asked) to move to another table because he wants to put a group over there of three people ( on table for 2) . I don't know about their food quality but the service is Horrible!! If you want a good service, good food go to Juliette et chocolate it is much better , and few steps away"
0,"We hadn't been here for several years and got a coupon so decided to try again for dinner .  First impression - DARK!   Seriously, so dark we can't read the menu (servers had to provide flashlights) and then could barely see our food.  Food was OK, but a bit pricey for what we got and service was a bit slow and sporadic.  We got a sopapilla for desert and it was strangely salty and sweet.  Overall, \""Meh\"" was our reaction.  Probably won't be back."
0,"This was the worst lunch I've had in quite some time and it cost me $16.00. I had never been to J. Alexander's before and was looking forward to it due to the good things I've heard. I ordered the rotisserie chicken, which is a half chicken served with a side. I elected to go with a side of vine ripened tomatoes, which was actually very good. The main issue I had with my lunch was with the chicken. For $16 I expected something much better. My meal came out very dry, it was actually so dry that it was crunchy. The waiter didn't seem to care that I had left almost all of my meal on the plate and just took it away. I can get a much better rotisserie chicken from Whole Foods for $10 and it's a whole chicken that is organic. I can't say that I'll be going back to J. Alexander's when there are so many other good restaurants in the area."
1,"Great all around -- as a casual, high quality dinner spot and as a market with solid deserts.  Fresh grilled fish, pizzas and salads all memorable -- sit at the chef's table, a high-top butcher block table with a prime spot to see all the action in the kitchen.  Highly recommend."

0,This company is HORRIBLE!! They don't know the meaning of customer service. If you are unlucky enough to have them assigned to you from Lowes or Home Depot request another service provider. The scheduler Julie is I must say the rudest customer service person I have had the displeasure of dealing with in a long time. They came out and looked at my leaking washing machine and my dryer. Said nothing was wrong. After they tech left I found a scratch on my washing machine glass top. This company is full of crack pots who need a reality check. Nice job Julie!

1,"Been meaning to visit here when I'm in town on business, and finally was able to come here the other night. Thanks to yelpers, I now have another great place to add to my list.\n\nThis was not only a great place to grab some food, but reasonably priced with very friendly servers and a fun experience. Just make sure you don't have any paper cuts because you will be using your hands! And if you get some of the spicy seasoning, then beware!\n\nThey do provide you with a bib, which I needed. Actually, I needed two since I ripped the first one and it became unusable. Fail on my part. Coupled with the plastic on the table and the paper towels, you do not wear your Sunday best here, unless you'd like it covered in their delicious sauces.\n\nI had the shrimp, calamari, and a bowl of rice. Wanted to try the crawfish but I had a craving for shrimp. Maybe next time, I come to Vegas often!"
0,"I have to say that my limited experience with Triple George Grill has left a horrible taste in my mouth. While the food was delicious, the service was horrible, especially for the price you pay.  I made reservations for my December 2012 wedding in April 2012 on the recommendation of a family member.  \n\nWhen I went to scope it out during September, they treated my group like crap.  We were a group of about a dozen bikers in town for Bike Week.  We were pleasant and ordered a lot of food a drinks, but the waitress apparently did not like us being in her section.  The service was rushed and she was outright rude to us when it came time to deliver the bill.  They refused to do any splits on the bill, even though we had asked before being seated.  The manager did not even care when my uncle mentioned my upcoming wedding party in the facility.\n\nFast forward two months to November and I am counting down the days to my Vegas wedding.  I get a call from the Triple George Grill telling me that there is a problem.  The event coordinator who had been handling my wedding was no longer with the restaurant.  The person looking at the paper work said the quote was wrong and that I did not have a signed contract (although I have the email proving otherwise).  She said the menu I had selected was $30 more a head than the quoted price.  When I challenged her on this, she said she would talk to her boss and call me back.  A week later she still had not called.  My fiance called to cancel the reservation, and the restaurant offered the originally quoted price; however, it was too little too late.  I have moved my wedding dinner to Vic & Anthony's at the Golden Nugget.\n\nSo, if you don't have a problem with bad service and business practices, I highly recommend the chicken parmigiana."
0,"I came here recently for lunch and thought I had walked in on a dinner theater production, or an episode of Seinfeld.\n\nI was standing in line when the owner started yelling at a customer.  At first, I thought they knew each other, but soon I realized it wasn't an act.  To make matters interesting, he then decided not to honor anothers Blimpie card -- because it was stamped from another location: \""I get nothing from this!\""  \""Go away!\""  I guess there was no sandwich for him, or soup!\n\nDuring these outbursts, some of the customers walked out in confusion.  I just took my sub and left. \n\nIn contrast, the employees all seem very nice and friendly.  But, I'll take a pass in the future and skip the drama. \n\nSorry!"
1,"I took my wife to Marssa for her birthday and we had the omakase.  It was one of the best meals we have had, anywhere, and I would say without hesitation that Marssa stands up to Morimoto in Philadelphia, which is one of my favorites.  Service was excellent, and Chef Kaz's creations were amazing. The chef used superior quality ingredients along with superior techniques on each course. The sushi courses were superb, ultra-fresh, and the fish was the star.  The cooked dishes were perfect, and the combination of both cold and cooked dishes over the course of the evening demonstrated Chef's skill and desire to present a memorable and first quality experience.  I would very highly recommend a trip to Lake Las Vegas just to try this restaurant--and then just go back again and again."
1,All of there food is delicious and sooo healthy
0,"In terms of shoe repair (my only experience with Heel To Toe), I found their prices to be insanely high.  My shoe repair shop in another comparable city where I used to live was much faster, far more reasonably priced, and better quality work.  Heel To Toe charged me $50 for a basic resole on a pair of leather sandals--they didn't even clean or treat the leather. (Mind you, these shoes originally cost $88.  I could have just purchased a brand new pair.)  These same sandals underwent the same repair three years ago by the other business I mentioned above for $25 and came back looking like new.  Heel To Toe took 2 weeks while my old shop took 2 days.  While I totally support privately owned local businesses, I found these prices to be completely alienating, and the staff to be rather snide."
1,"They are very, very creative in the themes of the show... and parts of the show they are very interactive with their audience... \n\nI give them props to be dancing that active for an hour long on and off...\n\nBut, it's a show that once you've seen it.... you won't watch it again ... for awhile..."
0,"This is Las Vegas' version of Tea Station I guess.  The sign said \""Tea Planet\"" but everything inside had the Tea Station logo.\n\nI think it's in the Tea Station employee hand book that the servers are supposed to be rude.  We got the same crappy service in Vegas that we would normally get in the San Diego and Los Angeles locations.\n\nOur drinks took a long time to come out (the place was not packed).   We ordered green tea, green milk tea, and peppermint milk tea - they were good though, they tasted the same and the boba had the same consistency as the other locations.    \n\nTheir spicy chicken wings were pretty good, I would have to say better than the San Diego locations.\n\nThis location gets 2 stars because of the bad customer service and the lengthy time it took us to get our drinks."
0,"This is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to by far. I cannot think of enough bad things to say about their service.\nThe Food is standard McDonald's fair, but, they did not give us our drinks with creamer, our order was wrong, the food oatmeal came without enough spoons for the orders count, we had to go back 3 times for all sorts of condiments, and they dish em out reservedly like their lives depend on it.\nThey do not seem to understand foreign accents and this is Las Vegas, seriously, if you are going to run a shop in a tourist town, you might as well be prepared for it."
0,"Only good on Mondays after 10 when they're having the Gutiar Hero event.  Which is quite fun.\n\nAll other times avoid like the plague.  It is nice and shiny, and small enough that it's never crowded so much that there's a line, but still sort of sucks the big one.  The bouncer can be very arbitrary with what constitutes proper attire, even when the bar is...empty?"

Arrive at the first club. Skip the line, don't pay cover. Dance, drink for an hour or two, then at a particular time hosts will tell you it's time to go to the next place. Repeat for two more clubs. As the evening goes on, the different groups consolidate into fewer and fewer buses as people stay at clubs they like or just get tired and leave. By the final club, all the groups are back together again. At the end of the night, find your way home (or ride the bus to a strip club.)\n\nWhy it's good:\n1) Skip the freaking idiotic lines at three pretty darn good clubs.\n2) You get to hang out with the same group of people all evening long... and you're stuck on a freaking bus, drunk, so everyone is really social. (The two strangers who met on the bus next to me got REALLY social, if you know what I mean.)\n3) The hosts are awesome. They drank with us, had a pole dancing dance off, and were just genuinely nice.\n4) The bus was surprisingly clean and comfortable. It's nice to sit for a bit after dancing. And it felt like a party in there.\n\nWhy it's bad (and no, the bads are not that bad):\n1) Casinos are huge so there's still a bit of walking from bus drop off to the clubs.\n2) The free shots on the bus taste like cough medicine.\n3) If two bachelor parties end up on the same bus, it's a freaking sausage fest (you can switch buses later, so it only matters in the beginning.)\n4) There's a little down time when people are waiting to leave the club. Everyone's just kind of standing around."

1,"Yesterday I went for a smog test for my car, spent about 10 minutes withs a lovely old guy, who as so bored ( I was his only client all day) he not to tell me the story of his life, no that was not that great, he learn his lessons a little to late, but I learn right in time that I can renew the registration of my car in less that two minutes! \nI have no idea who deserves the credit, but what a great idea this was! A DMV kiosks right inside a very popular store! \nSorry I don't shop here, but I will see you again next year to renew my registration without waisting a day in line at DMV :)"
1,"GC in Verrado has just gone under a ton of changes with staff, menu, and management.  This place has its kick back! \n\nYou can't beat the amount of craft brews on tap. Nice to have a locally owned business providing such great beer. This place has a home-town feel, and reminds me of the show \""Cheers.\"" The servers really try and get to know the guests and provide the best service possible.  \n\nThis place is great for Friday night hangouts, Saturday football games and in-house entertainment, and anytime you want to take a break and have a cold beer after a long days work. Also, the wine list is impeccable.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice night out, come back to GC and check out the changes.  You won't be disappointed."
1,"I had the spicy veggie wrap with green tea.  The wrap had good flavor and the tea was light and delicious.   I also bought some vegetarian bacon to try.  I think the wrap could have used some kind of veggie cheese as it was a little vinegar-like for my taste buds, but I did like it.  There was a mix of great vegetables and a slight spice came through but also a sweet twang was in it that I didn't like.  Anyway, the ingredients are high quality and I have been here many times for delicious healthy food.  Next time I'll go back to my usual fried items and curries.  This place is great!"
1,"You know what I love about this bar? No bull shit from the bartenders. They see a face in their domain, they immediately appear and take your order. Even when the place is packed. I like it. \n\nOk, and the fact that beer is five bucks doesn't hurt.\n\nThis is a good place to start, spend and end an evening. I've now had the pleasure of doing all of above on different nights of the week. \n\nAs a side note. the owners are great about lining up cabs when the place closes down. There wasn't a need to wait a long time for any of us (ahem) who needed them to get a ride home."
0,"I went to polished based on my friend's rave reviews. I WILL NOT be returning.\n\nFirst: I walked in without an appointment and asked for a pedicure, and they told me it'd be about 10 minutes before someone could get to me. That was fine, so I took my time perusing their color selections. After deciding on my color, I started looking at the gel colors. I have been getting gel manicures for a few years now, and I like to know what product is being used before I get one. I waited for the front desk assistant to finisher her phone call and asked her what gel product they used for manicures. Her response was \""Well, we aren't allowed to say what products we use exactly.\"" I'm sorry, WHAT?! I must have misheard her, so I asked her to clarify and she said \""Yea, we aren't allowed to say what products we use, but I think the name of the product is on the samples\"" and then she waved me away. Fine. I won't get a gel manicure here. \n\nNext, the girl who was doing my pedicure took me to my chair. The water was lukewarm at best, and I told her, but she just kinda nodded her head. Whatever, I was pressed for time and just wanted to get my pedicure done. She puts on her gloves and files my toes. Next thing I know, she says something about cleaning and gets up and WALKS AWAY. I proceeded to sit in the now-cold water for TEN minutes. She never returned. I started asking the women who were doing pedicures around me if she was coming back, and no one responded. It was like I didn't exist. \n\nAfter ten minues of sitting there waiting for someone who didn't seem to be coming back, I gathered my stuff and walked out. About 15 minutes later, they called me on my cell phone, but I couldn't answer. They didn't leave a message. Perhaps the woman who was doing my pedicure finally decided to return and was shocked when I wasn't there waiting.\n\nOVERALL: This place was busy and I'm sure regulars are treated well, but I will NOT be returning. The only good thing I got out of this was a free can of Coke."
0,"Went to Getaway last night for famous fajitas. Not so famous anymore... Waitress brought steaming hot plate after very long wait, she forgot the taco shells, when she finally got back , she brought pita bread instead, I corrected her she appologized and fixed it. The cooked meat was bland , no seasoning, like they used to have.wifes steak was overbooked and dry.were looking for a new place now."
1,The Pristine House Cleaning Group has done a fantastic job on cleaning my entire home in Las Vegas.  They took the time to clean throughly and they are a very nice crew.  I highly recommend them!
0,"Stayed at this hotel on 7/19/13-7/21/13.  First thing is that I would have expected much better service than what we received.  We splurged on a spa suite for our WEDDING weekend.  When I arrived at the hotel to check in, they tell me they can't find my room.  I begin to panic, but was able to find a confirmation number from Expedia (we booked through them).   They finally find my reservation just to tell me that they don't have a spa suite available, but will be happy to compensate by giving me $100 in slot play.  Ummm...........$100?!?!  I paid nearly $700 for 2 nights stay in a spa suite.  You want to downgrade me to a regular room which runs about $150 a night.... So that's nearly a $400 difference and you're going to give me $100?!?!?     Ummmm........I think not.  If you're going to give me a regular room, then you're going to reimburse me the difference, OR you can give me the room I booked in the 1st place.  I don't know what their customer service team is thinking, seriously.  So I basically had to argue back and forth for about 20 minutes with the check-in clerk.  Finally, she went to go get a manager just before I was about to lose my cool, and suddenly.... Wa la!  They magically found me a spa suite.  So they basically lied the entire time, and when they realized I wasn't going to give in, they gave me what I wanted.  I will not ever waste my money on this establishment again.  I'll stick to Bellagio and Treasure Island from now on.  Mandalay Bay has a few things to learn about customer service, ESPECIALLY at the rates they charge.  I have no problem paying those prices until my efforts and wedding are muddled by incompetence.  For incompetence, I will not be paying those prices at that establishment again."
1,"Picked this based on Yelp reviews. Adorable place with wood accents, a lovely bar, and a pressed-tin wall. Lively, but easy enough to hear the person next to you and carry on a conversation. A round of cocktails was carefully prepared by the man behind the bar, and I was able to select how sweet I wanted my Manhattan. (I went with the middle level, \""perfect,\"" and it was.) The gravlax appetizer with roasted veggies and what appeared to be a homemade mayo was fantastic. We had a roasted salmon that was perfectly cooked, served with  the most amazing squash agnolotti and fresh radishes in three colors. We also had a mushroom tart that was unique, with gorgeous pieces of huge mushrooms. The only miss came at dessert. Neither was a revelation. The praline was ok. The apple crumble was a dish of baked apples with approximately two teaspoons of the namesake crumble. Given that I never stop after the main course, I removed a star for the \""meh\"" desserts, but otherwise would definitely be back the next time I am in Montreal."
1,The owners of Songbird are genuinely friendly and welcoming. Songbird is a great place to hang out and enjoy quality coffee.
1,"LUX has the best coffee in town hands down. I've been to nearly all of the local coffee shops in Phoenix. I'm a complete addict. I work out of coffee shops and despite what some of these other folks say they observe I actually get more work done here than most other shops. I think the loudness and business of the place does it for me. Kind of like working out of the eXtreme Bean in Tempe.\n\nAny way, no other shop makes a white mocha (velvet) like Lux. Do yourself a favor and order a regular velvet mocha for here with their fresh homemade espresso whipped cream. Additionally, all of the pastries you see there are freshly baked in house too.\n\nSo good."
0,Went to a wedding. The food was ok and the drinks were way over priced 5 for a soda and 6 for a bottle of water! Really! 16 for a mixed drink.
1,"Pretty awesome bar! Went here for a few pre-dinner drinks with a few people, it was right across from where we were going to eat so it was the only thing that was close enough to walk to.\n\nThe outside doesn't look like much, but you walk in and it feels, smells, and looks  like you're somewhere warm, and tropical. The outside looks like a place that would be super small, and crowded place.  But it's actually a pretty good sized place. \n\nWe all sat down at the bar, with the tropical music playing in the background. Two of us got the everyday $3.00 Coronas, the other two got fruity, tropical drinks, very fitting. \n\nThe roommates and I talked about coming back to actually eat, and have more of the yummy drinks very, very soon, especially with it getting colder out."
0,"I've read that brevity is the soul of wit...\n\nBrevity is also a wonderful thing when it comes to the waiting time for your dinner of Italian peasant food...pizza:)\n\nBrevity is not Pizzeria Bianco's strong suit...(nor mine, in writing reviews, but we're not talking about me:)\n\nAfter my second visit in 4 years (and 4th visit overall), I'm trying to figure out what PB's strong suit is:(...public relations and marketing, perhaps?\n\nCreating the \""Pizza Placebo Effect\""?\n\nI generally try not to knowingly go anyplace that aggravates me, whether it's for dining, for drinking, for entertainment, for using the restroom...really for pretty much anything:)\n\nSo why were we back at PB after a good solid 4 year run of avoiding this particular aggravation?   \n\nOther people, that's why:)\n\nOther people wanted to go to PB...other people wanted to try the Wiseguy and the Marghareta and see Chris's oven and have mozzarella cheese and what not... and so the Beautiful Carin (who has the patience of a saint) and I took them out to PB the other evening...well, it was evening when  we started:(\n\nWe went...we waited...we had some pizza...and it was pretty average artisan pizza...\n\nWas it the worst pizza I've ever eaten?...oh no...'sup, Totino's?\n\nWas it the best pizza that I can remember eating?...oh no...How you doin' Flying Pie in Portland and Di Fara in Brooklyn?\n\nIs PB worth the aggravation?...Sadly, not for me:(\n\nFor me, it's hard to overlook the attitude at the door, and the \""you're barely worthy of eating here\"" attitudes of the servers (both in Bar Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco), as I try to enjoy my evening.\n\nI understand that all the kids \""assisting Chris\"" at PB think they're pretty special to be working at PB and all...but...it's a pizza joint...would it hurt them to at least try to be personable and pleasant?\n\nIt's also hard for me to overlook the multi-hour wait to dine at PB (and, truth be told, we've been here before...we did come expecting a wait...we were prepared to have wine and relax...I even had my flask, so I had a scotch and tried to relax)...still 3  1/2 hours...for pizza?\n\nI can fly  1/2 way to NYC in the time it takes to get a table (and the flight attendants on Continental are sweet and pleasant to me...feed me drinks in 1st class...you know...they make me feel appreciated:)\n\nAnd speaking of \""appreciated\""...it's hard for me to overlook the lack of appreciation we've encountered at PB:(\n\nThe few times we've been to PB, the staff hasn't seemed to be in a pleasant mood...very quick to tell us \""the rules of PB\"" and eager to let us know that if we weren't good little customers, there were 50 more people in line that would happy to take our places:(\n\nYou know what... they are right...there were 50 more people that would have loved to see us leave and they would have moved up in the queue.\n\nBut it's obnoxious of the folks at PB to make that the overriding theme of the evening and it belies any pretense that they might try to concoct about \""customer service\"" and being the \""the best possible pizza experience for each customer\""...the attitude of \""we're PB and you're not\"" is pervasive and unpleasant:(\n\nAnd frankly, when I spend well over $200 for pizza, wine and cheese for 4 in the course of a 3+hour wait, get a rush job on the very late dinner and a lamentable lack of service from the waiter (who's busy chatting with friends or \""regulars\"" at the counter)...well, it causes me aggravation.\n\nBut the good news is that I won't be back for another 4 years...less aggravation for me and more spaces in the line at the door:)"
1,I visited this place 2 years ago and never wanted to come back. Just recently I stopped by and noticed the owners changed. They are so polite and the bagels are great for the price! I went back for the 2nd time today and they've re-did the inside there is much more room. I had a bagel sandwich and an ice mocha coffee that is easily comparable to Dutch Brothers but half the price. If you haven't been to Bagel Nosh in a while I recommend trying them again!
0,"Even worse than Arizona Charlies buffet, nothing was even close to being hot enough to enjoy eating, the turkey was luke warm and dry as a bone, the mashed potatoes were watery and runny, the brussel sprouts were hard and cold and even the milk had a turned taste to it. As for the desert station it was horrible as well, everything was dry and hard and inedible except the Ice Cream, of course, but had to wait over 5 minutes to get someone to scoop us out a scoop, astonishingly enough the ice cream wasn't bad.  I have eaten at the Feast Buffet at Boulder numerous times and never had a complaint, this is the first and last time visiting Red Rock Feast Buffet.  If I could give it negative star rating I would, stay away from the Feast at Red Rock, it is not worth any money let alone $15 a head after tax."
0,"I don't like their flavor selection.\nI just don't\nCompared with other froyo places nearby, this one is my least favorite flavor-wise."
0,Disgusted I even have to choose a star. Horrible service. And the worker named roman is very unprofessional. He ignored me the first few minutes I was in there and then proceeded to make sexual comments towards me even after I told him I had a boyfriend. I was so disturbed by his behavior I had to run out of there without purchasing anything. DO NOT GO HERE!
0,"Ok, I didn't want to do this.  I had a bad night there for St. Patrick's Day, but I gave it another shot for Mothers Day brunch.  This is not the same Duce I first stepped foot into two years ago.  Defrosting cheesecake is not the same as last years Rock Spring Pie, and last but not at all least YOU DO NOT SERVE ALCOHOL IN CUPCAKES TO KIDS!  Even worse, with out them marked as containing alcohol, I sent my poor mother who is in recovery and allergic to alcohol, to go ahead and eat one!  This was the worst experience yet at the Duce.  It is just not the same place it use to be.  At 20 dollars a head for brunch, I could not even find juice and had to pay for lemonades at the bar.  So for the second time this year, I spent too much money for mediocre drinks and bad cheesecake.  The sliders and fruit bread were dried out.  I am soo disappointed, I loved this place at first.  When a show turns a bad corner, they say it has jumped the shark.  Well I am sad to report that the Duce has definitely jumped the shark."
0,"I've ordered carry out pizza at least a dozen times from this place.  It has always been pretty good, especially the crust.  Tonight they screwed up the order, which I didn't realize until I got home.  When I called to let them know, I was told the only way to make it right was for me to come back in for another pizza tonight.  A guy that I assume is the manager told me he made what I ordered (not possible), they don't give credit, and apparently just to be a smart ass told me they have buy on get one free on Monday but not today.  I told him I won't be coming back and he said \""OK, fine\""."
0,"Typical college-y bar feel. $5 cover for... what? I hate that I get charged cover to go into a bar. I live in San Francisco, and there's never a cover charge (and the bars are way better). And if there is a cover charge, it's because the place is actually freaking great, and it's usually worth it. \n\nCrowd was meh. Typical creepers trying to dance with you or stare you down every 5 seconds. Girls way too dressed up to be at such a casual bar (almost reminded me of a really dark and gloomy sports bar).\n\nI like that this place has an outside deck as well as a nice air conditioned inside. Very large dance floor, and a large bar area, making it somewhat easier to get a drink. \n\nWhat really concerned me more than anything was the poor choice of music. I think I heard \""apple bottom jeeaaansss... boots with the furrrr\"" about 3 times in the matter of an hour. Talk about overplayed AND completely not current. I didn't hear one current hit in the entire bar. The DJ was only playing songs that were hits 4 years ago over and over again. I had a fun time ONLY because I was with awesome people. The bar had nothing to do with my fun night. At all."
0,"Food was okay. But the server was horrible. Leticia (sp?)  had brown thin hair. She was rude, rolled her eyes and disregarded anything that we had to. Favorite part of the visit was the cannoli. But, I will never go back due to her service. She seemed to have personal friends at another table and spent all her time chatting with them."
1,"Love, love, love this place!  The food is amazing, the presentation is so artsy, great variety, the service is great!   Note to self, never book a show after the dinner here because 1.  Will be on time constrain so cant fully enjoy everything they have, 2. Will be too stuffed to run to the show once we are late by spending too much time nibbling n the deliciousness."
1,"Wow so yummy! Family style so don't over order. We took a lot home, but it was worth it. Fair pricing, excellent food and some entertainment ie you get to watch the noodles being made. This is a great casual dining experience."
1,"Decided to try this place out based on the strong reviews.  Turns out I got there just in time.  About five minutes after I walked in, they ran out of pedicure chairs.  The pedicure itself was amazing.  The tech took her time and even did a leg massage which not a lot of places do.  Not your average strip mall nail salon!  $50 for a pedicure and gel polish manicure.  I will definitely be going back, which is saying something as it isn't exactly convenient."
1,"Here right now.   Excellent food.  This is real mexican food..not americanized.  Had the chanclas (roll stuffed w chicken with chorizo sauce on top), molletes (bread toasted w beans and mozzarella) and chilaquiles (sort of like nachos).  Great choices and great food.  Will be back to try more.  Great value too."
1,"I've been going to Salon Surreal for about a year now. I get my waxes done there, and am totally in love with Kari!!! Those back rooms are great, and relaxing. I've gotten a facials and micro-dermabrasions done as well, all of it well worth the time and money I spent! \n\nI also have my hair done now by Nichole, who is new to the salon, but \nsuper sweet!! She's actually going to be doing my hair and the bride's hair for my brother's up coming wedding! And from what I've heard of her other formal 'do's she's amazing, so I'm very excited about that. \n\nNo matter what you're looking for this salon and spa has what you need! And if you're not sure, give them a call and the receptionists can give you a recommendation! \n\nI love the decor of the place, it's appealing to the eye (if you know what to look for) and it's classy. I would say it's the best mixture of an upscale salon and a place I could go just to hang out. \n\nEveryone that works there is nice and their personalities run the spectrum!! Some are sweet and soft spoken while others are boisterous and outgoing. The one thing I would never say is that this salon is anything like a factory. It's functionality and flowing set up allows clients to be the center of their stylists, esthetician, or nail techs attention. Each person there brings their own personality and pop! to their area but is by no means cluttered. \n\nI would recommend this salon to anyone visiting the Phoenix area!! They have fabulous male and female stylists, massage therapists, estheticians, and nail techs!!!!"
1,The Big Moke is one hell of a burger. The best I've had in ages! And I struggled to eat just half of it.  Any time I'm in the area I'll be eating here again!
1,I live in Los Angeles and I had to leave asap and they were able to fix my car quickly and with a smile. Left me extremely happy.
0,"I will give it a 2 for the horrible service I had at the bar. The bar guy didn't know s___ about beer or wine. It took him about 5 minutes to even say hi. I asked for \""menus\"" and he gave me the drink menu... after 5 mins. He asked what I wanted... then I asked for the food menu... another 2 mins. then another 10 mins. 'till he asked me about the food. There were only 4 people at the bar an about 15 in the restaurant. \n\nFood - I really liked the food and think the $9 app. happy hour is well worth it. Try the Hot stones."
1,"The BEST Thai in town. Not just in my hood, but the best period. I'm not usually regretful but I'm seriously upset that I just recently discovered this gem. \n\nThe Massaman curry is amazing. With big chunks of sweet potato and buttery avocado, \""It's the best Jerry, the best!\"" Spicy #7 is ALL I can handle. They do 1-10 on the spicy scale and we're talking serious heat here. If my Thai food doesn't cause a runny nose, I don't wanna eat it. David Wong's does the trick every time. If you order spicy #5 at your usual Thai joint, you probably wanna cut that down to about a #2 at Pan Asia. \n\nIf you LIKE Thai food, try David Wong's, and you will LOVE Thai food."
1,"I love Patina Decor's new store - just one block south from their previous home on Main St. With so much more space, they are able to group complete arrangements of stylish retro designer furniture, rugs, ceramics, glassware and artwork, and there is also a great selection of vintage clothing and designer jewellery.\nI went to Tim and Kate with quite a difficult request, and they were so friendly and helpful - the end result far exceeded my expectations.\nNow that street parking is free, and with new stores and a coffee shop just opened up, shopping on Main St is becoming a much more relaxed and enjoyable experience, and Patina is a store where it's worth taking time to explore."
0,"Not a good weekend for dining out, I guess.... Stopped at Byrd's for drinks after work on Friday - here's our take on it.\n\nThe place is confusing, and it would seem as though the staff is quite confused as well.  We walked in and stood at the bar for a few minutes - we weren't sure how to go about scoring an outdoor table, so we thought it best to ask.  \n\nUnfortunately, no one stopped to help us; the bartender stood on the opposite end of the bar, talking to folks.  Waitresses zipped past us without a word.  We went upstairs to check on things ourselves and it still wasn't clear if we could just grab a table.  So it was back downstairs where we flagged down a manager who told us we could seat ourselves.  Whew.\n\nSat at a table outside for a bit before a waitress stopped by to see if we needed anything.  We asked about drink specials - she wasn't sure if there were any; perhaps tap beers were $1 off?  \n\nWe ordered a few beers.  And waited.  And waited some more.  And then we switched tables (the shade looked more inviting).  And then our beers came out and the waitress was gone.  We flagged her down for the check and waited some more.  And then we left.  \n\nDisorganized for sure.  Drinks were reasonably priced, but that's about the only positive to share.  Unlikely that we'll go back.  :-("
1,"I am a huge fan of Crescent Ballroom.  It is an amazing venue to watch a show.  The only thing that stops me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that we got there a couple of hours before the show to eat dinner and have cocktails, but when we wanted to go into the show, we had to exit the restaurant and get in line.  I don't understand why they can't scan our tickets from the inside and give us bracelets there.  Other than this issue I would recommend seeing a show there anytime you have a chance."
1,"We live close to San Tan Flat, and come here often for special occasions. It's great to be able to sit by a fire, listen to some music, and hang with friends. We've come dressed to the nines and in jeans. Anything goes here. The food is great, and I recommend the Chicken Strips. How they make humble run of the mill chicken strips so yummy is beyond me, but they are very good! The staff is always helpful, nice, and ready and willing to help with anything you need. If you aren't in to crowds, come during the middle of the week. The weekends are really busy!"
0,"We went here for brunch. We ordered 5 different items before they actually had something in stock. We actually went from the breakfast menu to the dinner menu. Our daughter loved her pancakes but our food was so greasy. The decor in the recent is very dated and the bathrooms are scary!\n\nI am revamping my review after the follow up post so that the Owner can see my comments and make aware to others-the reason why we Yelp. We went to this restaurant because it was reviewed and had good reviews, we were just surprised. We did not attend yesterday, but I did write the review yesterday because I had time to write it up. We actually went 2 weeks ago on a Saturday after all of the BBQ items were off the menu because BBQ night is Friday apparently. I would NEVER hold it against anyone for the weather conditions as we had on 9/8/14. Honestly that is ridiculous. NO ONE saw that storm coming nor did they realize what was going to happen. But that was NOT when we visited this location.  When I make a comment about the renovations, it is my opinion. I was confused by the laminated discs hanging on the wall and the blue room across, that is my opinion, and I am entitled to it. Part of being on yelp is making comments about the ambience of a room-unless I have understood that wrong. I love retro and vintage but that was not what was happening at this location. \n\nWe will not be back. I honestly can say I did not feel that my food was \""fresh\"" I had a greasy ruben that was underheated and french fries that were limp. As I stated before my daughter loved her pancake and was excited about eating it, that is why I gave 1 star. My husband had a burger and it was greasy as well and the beans he had on the side were worse than Bush's Baked Beans-or perhaps they were the same thing, he honestly could not tell and he did not finish them. \n\nHopefully this 2nd review clears up any issues you have with my OPINION on YELP!"
1,"This is a belated review for a meal that took place in late January, so some of the details will be a little sketchy, but I actually made my 4-star determination that night, so that much at least is accurate. :)\n\nSERVICE: The reservation desk was very patient with my repeated phone calls to change our meal time (maybe because we were guests at the resort). We ended up with an 8:30 seating for six, and were seated promptly. It took a long while (10 minutes?) to get bread, water, or menus. Once the captain came with the menus, he had to give us a long speech about the artwork on the fronts of the menus. It was interesting, but at that point, we mostly just wanted to read them and order. Overall, the \n\n There was a strange moment when the captain plus 5 waiters descended simultaneously, each taking a position behind one of us; it was impressive, but perhaps not the way they intended--it felt a bit like we were about to have sacks pulled over our heads & we'd wake up an hour later in the back of a van. Fortunately, they simply presented us each with our napkin. \n\nWINE: Sommelier was a little standoffish and not overwhelmingly helpful. List is weird. Strikes me as the list of a young restaurant that bought a bunch of stuff right before the economy crashed, so there's not much that they've had a chance to cellar and some of the prices are just out of line. There were some decent wines in the \""not insanely priced\"" range (hard to do much with 3x markup), but I'm fairly certain one of the bottles I ordered was mis-priced on the wine list, because it showed up a much higher price on the bill. To their credit, they honored the wine list price without a fuss. There were some terrible choices/values on the list, such as '05 Lascombes for $300 (really not ready, plus I've seen it retail for as little as $50/bottle!).\n\nFOOD: With six people doing 3 courses, I can't remember it all in detail over two months later, but some highlights from my memory: squash soup (poured from a carafe into a bowl containing a mound of house-made cotton candy), charcuterie plate (which included a slice of bellota ham... decadent!), bison tartare, lamb loin. My entree was the veal ribeye and it was a disaster; I can't believe a self-respecting chef would serve such a poorly prepared fat blob. I probably should've sent it back, but I was too busy keeping an eye on two of my fellow diners, who had been busy at the bar for an hour or so before the meal. Two of our party toddled off after the entree, but three survivors tackled dessert with me, and the slightly spicy mexican chocolate souffle was a revelation.\n\nATMOSPHERE: It was a full room when we arrived, and there were a number of moon-eyed couples and a few families. If there was anyone obnoxious that night, I'm afraid it might have been us. :-/\n\nSUMMARY: I'm glad I ate at Kai. It has potential, and there's some interesting stuff going on in the kitchen, including use of local and indigenous ingredients. However, from my experience, the misses in food and service kept Kai short of greatness."
1,"Wow! I absolutely love this place. For its location on route 19 in central Mount Lebanon, this place is gigantic. It has its own dedicated parking lot in the back, which is great because parking in the ares is always a bit problematic. \n\nThis is a great little hardware store with all the smaller items of a typical store, but a little less in terms of large items like wood, fencing, etc. It's also a bit confusing with the layout, and I got separated from my family and lost in the store. It was a glorious kind of lost though, because I love hardware stores. This place has a lot of nicer high-end fixtures like lighting and faucets that I haven't seen at the big-time stores. \n\nIn addition to traditional hardware items, this place carries some kitchen supplies, camping and outdoor gear. They had a great selection of reasonably-priced Carhart gear in the center of the store that I was eyeing for Christmas gifts, and I also saw an aisle full of ceramic teapots that I reluctantly avoided to prevent unnecesary spending. This place is great for browsing DIY-ers and people who just love to roam hardware stores, like me. \n\nI went here at the beginning of October and they have a great selection of adorable Halloween decorations. The center of the store has a giant table full of sale items, including last-season decorations and random knick knacks. I didn't get a chance to explore the place in depth so I can't say too much about its inventory or prices, but it's a wonderful, large, convenient, and interesting store and I can't wait to go back."
1,"I checked out this place with a buddy of mine for lunch while the rest of the party crew (unce unce unce) was battling hangovers back in the hotel room. The food can be pricey, but hey it's seafood and we're in Vegas and \""turn down 4 what\"" right? We ordered a couple orders of stone crab claws along with hash browns and cole slaw. The crab was a hitter along with the mustard (mustard on the best ho!) sauce that was served with it. And that key lime pie to top it all off was money. Ca ching!"
1,My friend and I had dinner here after meeting the chef om wonderful food I enjoy the variety of naan bread and vegetable Thali relaxing atmosphere and very nice service I love going to aurhentic  restaurants where they actually have authentic music playing definitely will be coming back
1,"Such a good show. All though it might lose you in the middle of the play overall it's one of the best shoes I've seen yet. They staff is very quick. They show is really good the little party after wards is the best, seeing everyone happy was such a good feeling. They do not allow you to take your phones out during the show. Have fun and enjoy te show. Best of the best"
0,"This gym has the most rude and condescending staff I have ever encountered! The ring leader being John M, the sales manager. This guy struts around like a cock in a hen house. He has treated myself and my mother so horribly that I go out of my way to work out at another la fitness. Many of the trainers act like they are too good to be there and are lazy. Asking for help with a machine is never fun. I will not be renewing my membership with la fitness and have made it a personal mission to spread the word of the negative ugliness John has fostered at this location."
1,The food at this place is AWESOME! I love the sweet and sour shrimp and the veggie egg rolls. I don't know why their egg rolls are so good but I think about them on a daily basis. The service is quick and super friendly.
0,"Now you serve liquor? Are you a bunch of uneducated people ? It's a water park with kids, for kids , you need drunks in there? Really? I'm done you lost me as a customer for sure! Along with my wife and 2 kids! Kiss my white swim trunks!"
1,"Quite simply Packs and Dogs is a unique experience.....Hundreds of beers, and the dogs were awesome...Had the Bloodhound, wow,...The Kielbasa Bulldog is what a Pittsburgh food in tube form should taste like! Place is clean and funky welcoming. Mark who runs the place is first class ....Catch the view of the city and walk on down to Packs & Dogs tell em' the Jersey Boys sent you, special surprise awaits...Can't wait to get visit again..."
0,"The atmosphere is great for watching a game or grabbing a drink before a movie at the theatre next door; however, the food is mediocre at best. \n\nMy first time visit I had the salmon salad. It was bland and boring. Not worth $14 for sure! \n\nSecond visit, I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup. Upon it's arrival it was obvious it had been sitting in a Cambro in the walk-in for a couple days. Seriously, it came out cold and congealed.  I put my spoon in the bowl and bounced it on top of the soup jello. Giving benefit of the doubt, I had them refire it. It came out scalding Hot and I burnt my tongue (did they do that on purpose?). The flavor was ok but I kept thinking why am I bothering to eat this slop?! \n\nBottom line, the food is frozen and made in bulk. It's expensive for the quality but you are paying for location and convenience."
0,"The waiting room was empty and now I know why. And come to think of it, this urgent care looks empty every time I pass by. One day I was \""urgently\"" sick and walked right in. I now know that this is a very expensive Urgent Care, more so than others I've been to and it's upsetting because it's located less than a mile from ASU. When college kids get sick they probably can't afford to spend $250 for a visit without insurance. Come on! Sniffle sniffle. I'm going back to bed!"
0,"Pastrami was good, bread was soggy. Cajun fries had a good seasoning. Fresh strawberry lemonade was probablly the best thing in the meal. This place isn't even close to Johnny's Pastrami in LA, which blows it out of the water."
1,"Had lunch today.  Really good quality food.  Husband had the lamb sandwich and loved it.  I had the salami sandwich which was good.  The little salads brought back memories of my Greek grandmother's everyday salads.  Place is a little pricy, but maybe because of quality.  Other Yelpers commented on size reduction.  We'll be back and I might try the meatball sandwich to see what comes out,"
0,"Food was sub par, one step up from taco bell. The drunken nachos were ok, but hard to eat. The main courses were not spectacular. Mojitos tasted like a cheap sugar mix... Overall it was $80 for two people, I wouldn't think it was worth $40."
1,We got to the restaurant early but we could not be saeted for one hour . There is a beautiful lounge next to the waterfront.thecwaitress was attentive but it was cold wecrequested that the  heater get turned on but itvran out of gas. The fish we ordered was good but portion was small I had to order extra bread to get filled up. The c italian soup I ordered eas good but look warm. I akso tried their lasagna better portion but wery salty. The service was good at all times
1,"So there's one thing on the menu here that I'm a huge fan of. If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't have rated Cafe Rio a 4. \n\nGo to Cafe Rio on a Tuesday. Order their Coconut Shrimp Tacos. Eat the Coconut Shrimp Tacos. Leave Happy. \n\nThese tacos are seriously heaven on earth. You can order 1 or 2 tacos with a side of rice and beans. A fountain drink comes with the tacos since it's the daily special. Each taco is stuffed with 2 or 3 pieces of coconut breaded shrimp, lettuce, some cilantro and comes with a side of warm mango chunky salsa. It's really unfortunate that these tacos are only available on Tuesdays. Or else I'd be there every single day as their star customer! \n\nTheir rice and beans are alright, nothing to gush over. Personally, I think the rice and beans at Chipotle are better. They have homemade tortillas here. Those are alright, too. If you get their burrito, spend a dollar more to get it \""enchilada style\"". They douse their hot sauce over the burrito and sprinkle cheese on top. \n\nCafe Rio recently started to put their specialty drinks out by the fountain drinks. Their strawberry lemonade, mint limeade and horchata are all available to refill for free! I personally like to mix the strawberry lemonade and the mint limeade together. It's really refreshing - a must-have for the Vegas summers. \n\nDon't forget to get a stamp card! Buy 10 meals and get 1 free!"
0,"Had a business lunch there today, and definitely will not be returning for the food. I heard whispers about town that the food at this Vig was going to be better than their other locations. So, I was excited to give this one a shot, as I have totally given up on their other locations for anything other than drinks, and light snacks.\n\nThe outside eating area and bar are just perfect for the fall weather. The design is simple, cohesive, friendly & warm. The praise stops there.\n\nWe ordered chips & guac. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil, and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious... more on the verge of going bad. \n\nOne person joining us had the deconstructed tacos, which she barely touched, as the fish was more like fish jerky, and the side of beans totally tasteless. I shared the \""best turkey sandwich\"" with someone, and had high expectations with a name like that. It was a soggy mess of flavors. None of the ingredients stuck out, and it quickly fell apart after the first bite. \n\nNothing was exceptional. Sort of bummed by the experience, but at least it will be a fun place to grab a beer on a lovely fall evening."
1,"Dessert fans unite!\n\nI am not one but the wifey definitely is...  She dragged me to the original Serendipity 3 in NYC and we've been to this one in Vegas quite a few times.   It's almost always a dessert trip here so I don't have any advice on the food.  I did have the Fried Oreo Cookie Sundae which is just about one of the best dessert's I've eaten from a restaurant.  They don't do the classic County Fair fried oreo... Here they \""bread it\"" with Corn Flakes and when it melts the ice cream a little... its like dunking your oreo cookie in milk when you are eating it together with the ice cream.  \n\nMy wife has always been a fan of the frooozen hot chocolate and now they have many different flavors.  I think we ended up with the classic one for everyone to try.  We had gotten the apple cobbler ala mode also to share with the group and it was a pleasant change to the other dishes being that it didn't feel like a complete sugar overload.  The apples had a perfect tart contrast with the cobbler and ice cream and it created a nice addition to the mix.\n\nI'm a fan... are you?"
0,This place refused to serve me after 1 beer. This place is a joke and should go out of business already.
1,Great spot and friendly staff. Highly recommended!
1,Soto on St.Paul (I think) was our favorite place for sushi when visiting Montreal and were very sad to see it go. Luckily we found out the chef had opened his own place called Juni on Laurier. The menu is missing a few of our past favorite dishes but it still outstanding and is a must if you enjoy sushi. Make a reservation because it is always packed and try the B52 roll that has rice crispies in it. For a drink try the Baldwin Barmacie across the street.
1,"I've taken my kids there for lab work and the clinic personnel are always very nice and professional.  It is not as busy as the bigger clinics, so I prefer to go there instead of where our docs are when we need labs done between visits."
1,This is a great location. Right near several of your shopping or eating needs. The store is very big. It is clean and the cashiers are fast and friendly.\nWhat I love is the Deli. The type of lunch meat they offer is good and they have many meats and cheeses to choose from. \nThe restroom is clean. They do have a bank located inside so it is convenient but I actually found them very rude and hard to bank with and went elsewhere.
0,"I have never been overly impressed by Sentry but it is the neighborhood store closest to my home.  Therefore, I end up there for groceries more often than not. \n\nThen came yesterday:\n\nI have been looking an issue of Time magazine.  I have tried a few places with no luck.  So rather than waste gas money, I began calling around.  I live about a mile from the Sentry store and thought I would give it a call on the way home.  The phone was answered and I simply asked: Do you carry Time Magazine?  Her response was: Maybe, yeah I think so.  Before I could ask if it was in stock, she hung up on me.  No good bye.  Nothing.  If she was busy she could have said that.  \n\nSo I go into the store to search for it, assuming it is there.  I do find it in the magazine rack and I check the head of the registers.  I hear a voice and immediately recognize the woman who answered the phone.  She had a peach colored fleece on.  She is an older woman in her 50/60's with graying hair behind the customer service register.  I pass her up because I am completely upset to see her doing nothing.  The fact that she hung up on me and I come to the store and I see her sitting on a chair doing nothing angered me.  \n\nI continued to look for my magazine.  One of the cashiers asks if they can help me with something.  I tell her I am looking for Time Magazine.  Her response: Well, umm, what?  Never heard of it.  \n\nNow, I could care less if they do not carry it, but thus far I have been told you might carry it by a woman who hung up on me and then a cashier who has never heard of a national magazine.  I keep looking.  I ask another cashier who might know.  After all, what if I just overlooked it?  She says she does not know.  And that is it.  \n\nThat is my whole experience trying to find a magazine.  I walked out feeling completely terrible.  I shop at the store because it is near my house.  Last night, I decided to stop shopping there.  I will drive to the belt line and go to Pick and Save or up to Sun Prairie.  I will NOT go to your store."
0,"I like Zoyo, but I'm not sure I would come here if it weren't for the little girl I babysit who loves their yogurt. Sometimes I just feel like their flavors are too processed, and all of their yogurts regardless of dairy content or flavor have high fructose corn syrup in them. \nIf you do go here, try the cake batter or the oatmeal cookie flavors, with toasted coconut."
0,"20 oz beers OK, but  $8 for that beer, hrm. Loud thumping music makes it difficult to have a conversation - on the phone or otherwise. If you've got to wait for a plane, meh, it's alright, but wouldn't be my first choice in the future."
0,"Although the decor is pretty this place is pretty ghetto. \n\nI was shocked at all the good reviews, but realized most of them weren't for the hotel itself. \n\nOur room was dirty with hairs from the previous guest in the sink (it was clogged) and bathtub, the floor had a lot of stains on it, hardly any of the television stations advertised worked alongside the buttons on the phone. When I drove in from LA on a Wednesday morning I was informed there would be parties from 10am-6pm and again at 10pm-6am. Since when do hotels take preference to the low budget crowd vs. hotel guests during weekdays? There was no room in the hotel that could avoid the awful music. Even when the place was empty they were bumping some type of techno. \n\nWhen I attempted to express my issue with the front desk it was discarded and I was given an \""oh well\"". Extremely bad customer service and room service (Mood). I will never come here again."
1,"I dig five guys because of the quick service, great burgers, and tasty fries. I ordered a small, but I somehow received enough fries to feed five people, which I'm not complaining about.  I ate it all.  As for the burger, apparently a regular is double patty goodness, and this fat chick scarfed every bite down.  I love that the toppings are free, so I grabbed some onion, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and relish on mine.  Divine.\n\nThis place isn't crowded before 1pm, so grab one for breakfast when they open at 11."
1,Best haircut of my life! The highlights were great too. Ask for Jennifer D. Can't wait to go back.
1,"I had heard about this place for years but never went. Tragic I know! Just recently I discovered that it was literally walking distance from Jester'Z Improv where I work. Oh, how i must now make up for lost time!\n\nPop the Soda Shop is a true place of brilliants. They have a fantastic selection and a very knowledgeable staff. When you come to pops that is what you are looking for, product. And they have the best selection in town. \n\nA couple of recommendations. Doctor Eli's Blueberry, Jackson Hole Huckelberry, or really any thing in the Birch Beer section!"
1,"One day I'll make it there for something besides breakfast, but I don't know why to bother when the breakfast is so good. They do stop breakfast at 10:30am though."
1,"Ordered the 7 course tasting menu.  Excellent flavors and impeccable service.  My husband had the 5 course tasting menu.  Great view,  Nice wine selection...had Chardonnay and Malbec.  Good choices. Good idea for watermelon pairing with heirloom tomatoes and balsamic vinegar.  Duck breast and spicy quinoa was a good pairing.  Loved the poached pear.  Beautiful plating and dish selections."
0,"It's a nice park, but they don't allow any tailgating.  We show up with 15 people and an RV and were expecting to BBQ but none of that is allowed.  It would have been nice to know before we bought all the tickets.  Never going back again."
1,"first time today and what a surprise! ! they have live music. I ask one of the girls and she said is every Sunday.... \nMe and my wife we both had some soup perfect on these weather, next time I'll try one of the pastas.."
1,"Our 12 hrs layover at Charlotte: Midwood was our second lunch.  My bf and I shared the combo platter.  The meal consist of brisket, spareribs, sausage, pulled pork, hush puppies, baked beans and Mac n cheese!  All that food for only $22!!!!!  All the meat was deliciously smokey flavored.  My favorite was probably the spare ribs.  Hush puppies were not too greasy, just wish that there was jalepeno in it.  The baked bean was just perfect, great tangy smokey taste.  The Mac n cheese was sooo good, especially the top crispy crust.  Our waiter Andra was very friendly and attentive."
1,"Great place to fix your glasses. Very friendly and genuine staff. My glasses screw fell off and the nice gentleman who helped me, fixed it in 5 minutes. 100% recommended."
1,I always get great food and good service. Never disappointed. I usually get the chicken shwerma or kebob.
1,"This is my favorite mexican fast food place in the Old Town, South Scottsdale area, great flavor, good portion sizes. If you want something to finish off a night of partying in Old Town, this place will be open late for you!"
1,"I love this place because it feels like your really in Japan, when you get inside there are menu items posted all over the walls around, in english and in Japanese. atmosphere is great, servers are cute and friendly. most of all the food is really good."
1,"Comfortable & quiet.  I feel nurtured in this joint.  I eat in the bar so I can feel close to the piano (weird, I know).  I don't go for the food, but it is enjoyable.  The chicken marsala has an eclectic sweet taste which is refreshing.\n\nPS.  Don't call old Vegas tacky, it's Fabulous Las Vegas, not \""7 shades of Beige\"" Las Vegas.\nRIP Liberace"
1,"This place is perfect! Somehow, it can accommodate a family setting with children and a typical scottsdale bar hopping crew at the same time! It has delicious food but the drinks are unbelievable. BEST BLOODY MARY in town!!"
0,"Terrible service to start off with\n\nWe were seated and waited about 5minutes for the waitress to come by to take a drink order. She didnt tell us any specials of the day and when I asked to be moved to a table and not a high top I got the worst snob ever. We went to another table and the waitress in that station came over to get out drink order however we told her the other waitress got it, just not our order. We mustve been invisible to her because she didn't bring our drinks nor tell the other waitress what our drinks were. The table next to us got water and drinks before us, so I waited a few more minutes and the waitress came over to say that she didn't know what was going on but what was our drinks. Forget it, im leaving because this is just poor service.\n\nThat waitress should find a job she enjoys doing because this is definitely not her thing! I run a restaurant and that's by far the rudest staff ive met!"
0,"I feel like Twitter is pretty useless so far; I have an ok amount of followers I guess, but I feel like they're all following so many people that anything I say gets lost in the mess of their feed. I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\n\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\n\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\n\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\n\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door."
1,"I love this place!  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I try to have dinner here whenever I'm in Vegas.\n\nThe patio is one of the best on on the strip, right across from the Bellagio fountains.  The interior is dark, but very inviting.\n\nThe steak frites are excellent.\n\nThis is a great place to go for a romantic dinner or even a night out with the guys/girls."
1,"I can't comment on the restaurant, as we didn't eat there.  But we had a scoop of the chocolate mousse gelato and it was out of this world, very flavorful, but light and refreshing."
1,"Nice little Sushi spot in Copa. The California Rolls and the Insanity Rolls are bomb. Had the Gyoza and Beef Bowl also. Both were excellent. Got to come back and try more stuff on the menu. The customer service could have been better, but overall this place is little hidden gem in Copa."
0,"We went here out of desperation when so much else was closed and the hotel food was predictably bad.  The coffee was lackluster and the food choices were not that interesting.  There wasn't much that was edible for a vegetarian.  They had set menus for breakfast and even though one included a croissant, you couldn't order a croissant a la carte. I would think that a croissant would be a staple but I guess not.  The english muffin I got instead was small and tasted like it was from the grocery store.  Mostly tourists ate here and we did too but only out of desperation.  I must find better options so I don't have to eat disappointing food like this again."
0,"Brews Brothers ... a play on the Blues Brothers ...  I came in with a party of 6 only to find high top tables for 2 or 4 ... no problem, we just pushed 2 together.\n\nThe 1st two tap beers I ordered they were out of ...  +40 beers ... I hope they are keeping their lines clean ...\n\nOrdered a water to find the straw was about an inch short of the top of the glass.\n\nFood ... Burgers, turkey burger, pulled pork ... those are your choices ... no other options all burgers cooked to well done.\n\nThey have a handful of sides including home made chips (which were a bit rubbery) and hand cut fries (which were like mash potato sticks; they needed to be cooked a lot longer).\n\nThe burger was decent as long as you are okay with well done.  If you need a fork you have to ask for one (oh and it is a plastic fork).\n\nmy recommendations:\n\n1.  take out some tables.  it was jammed full of tables and chairs, making it supper hard to walk around the place.\n2. If you are going to only offer well done burgers you might was well have a slow cooker full of done burgers to help speed up the process.\n3. the fryers have to be to small for the volume of fries and chips they need to make (this is why they are mushy).\n4. They need other menu items.  How about chicken or a salad?\n\nRight now it is at about dive bar status ..."
1,Michael Mina's Pub 1842 is an amazing pub restaurant. The Peanut Butter Crunch burger is AMAZING!!! The bacon jam mixed with potato chips on the burger is just heavenly. I would highly recommend those whose are staying at the MGM hotel & casino to stop by for a bite to eat. The Lobster Corn Dogs are also equally tasteful and delicious. This is one of my favorite restaurants located in the MGM. I have been a regular several times now when staying at MGM.
1,"I agree with the other reviewers who are reluctant to give a good review because they don't want this place getting \""too\"" popular and crowded. However, I had such a positive first experience that I must spread the good news. \nThis place is unique and a welcome addition to the other cookie cutter restaurants @ 7th Ave & McDowell. The menu is also unique and a refreshing change from the typical breakfast fare offered at most other places. The ambiance is modern, and comfortable. The portions are plentiful and I had no chance of leaving the restaurant hungry because the chef skimped on anything. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant with friends."
0,"I went to the stall in the Atwater market to get some lunch.  We got a Cheddar Bacon sausage and a Peanut and Coriander sausage.\n\nBoth we not only cold inside, but the cheddar bacon one was almost raw.   The taters were overdone.  We ended up bringing them home and cooking them ourselves and the flavor of the bacon cheddar one was pretty good, but the peanut coriander one was a real disappointment.  It was super dry and we threw out most of it. \n\nSounds like we missed out on the pogo, but for the price (8$) for each sausage I won't be trying them out any time soon."
1,"Nom! I love Pinks! Especially their spicy sausages, they are extremely flavorful and are happily spicy.\n\nBut one of the main reasons why I love Pinks is because of its location, it is located right outside of Miracle Mile so you can enjoy a one mile stroll and work up an appetite before you gorge yourself on hot dogs and sausages. But make sure you take an extra stroll at the Forum Shops before hand so you can enjoy the delectable Chilli Cheese Fries. They are super yummy, and if you get in a decent work out during your shopping run you won't even feel that guilty about it."
1,"Bakery Wee created our baby shower cake, which was amazing!!!!  The taste was just as great as the looks!!!  Hoping to get our sons birthday cake done as well!!"
1,Carne Asada chimichanga...very good and tasty!!! The flavor and marinade is good. Lots of food for your$$$$. They have chicken tacos on special for $1.20 each. Quite a great deal if you ask me. The staff is very friendly and professional. Robertos is always awesome for anytime munchies.
1,"I love XS. \n\nI'm not a fan of the indoor portion of the club. In fact, I'd probably avoid it in there altogether because it gets relatively stuffy and crowded.\n\nBut the outside.. the outside area is amazing. There's so much room to roam and frolic when the mood suits you, and what's even better is that there's tons of places to relax your feet without bouncers telling you that it's a bottle service only area.\n\nThey have so many tables that initially they ushered us to a daybed/ enclosed area right amidst the pool. After that area got sold, they gave us our own cabana. And their cabanas are impressively large. Granted, I'm sure that us being 25 girls was likely a large determining factor. \n\nEven club-o-phobes can appreciate the less pretentious atmosphere that envelopes XS. Everyone's too busy having fun amongst their group to even prowl the crowd. We were able to  enjoy each other's company without having to swat douchebages away. \n\nOutstanding design. I'm blown away with how well this club is put together.  Oh and TONS of beautiful girls. The guys are meh."
0,"The salesman, David, was great.  But, that was about it.  Our used vehicle had scratches and dents, but we drove over 175 miles for the vehicle on New Years eve, and didn't have any other options.  The car runs great and looks great, but we were never told about the scratches.  They offered to take $250 off and fill the tank, however we noticed after leaving that those were promises were not kept.  I wouold not use them again."

0,"Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Customer service was awful and my car wasn't even clean. Seriously, as I was driving away I noticed it hadn't even been wiped down inside. I would have driven back to complain, but was too upset by how I was treated by the men who were washing my car. Never going back. Ever."
0,"If you hate flavor, come here! Chicken unseasoned, and overcooked till good and dry... generally flavorless food. Mexican food without cheese, pay $1 extra for that.. pass next time. Manager was friendly at least... only reason for the second star..."
1,"Headed by the former Wan Fu chef, this place is great (and I know my Chinese food).   This place is mostly a secret among the  Chinese community (for now); food is delicious and authentic. Vegetables, fish, walnut shrimp, fried rice, all good."
0,Horrible service.  To and from drivers changed every pickup/dropoff resulting in inconsistent pickup time/location. We had the bus for 3 nights.  Pickup was late one night and bus literally broke down the other.  Save yourself the hassle and money--stay far far away from this service.
1,I liked everything about this place. Brady came up to our table and was super friendly. My date loves the HMS radio show he is on. So he was excited to come try it as Brady talked about it on the radio. I live near it and have wanted to try it too. I got the BBQ Burger which was great! My date got the 3 meat meal. He said he enjoyed it very much. The two sides he got were Mac N Cheese and Fried Polenta Cakes.......both were fantastic. We both plan to go back. I wanna try the Red Neck tacos next time!
1,"I don't know what happened when everyone had such bad experiences. Throughout the entire night from the moment we walked in, ordered, ate our food and left, we were completely satisfied. How about those sunsets! Our waitperson was very friendly, courteous, and informative. I went with her recommendation on the Cuban sandwich, which was a special. All I can say is Awesome! I tried my daughters fried fish and that also was very good. We will be back."
1,"Le Burger Bar mon petit coup de c\u0153ur pour les burgers! Je m'y suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendue \u00e0 plusieurs occasions et pour ma part, je n'ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7ue! Leurs hamburgers sont un d\u00e9lice, la viande est de qualit\u00e9 et fond en bouche. En accompagnement on a le choix entre des frites \u00e0 la patate douce ou une salade verte/salade de choux. Personnellement quand je mange un hamburger, je prends toujours la portion de frites, et je peux vous dire, en tant que belge, nondidju qu'elles sont bonnes leurs frites! Par contre, ayez l'estomac bien grand car les quantit\u00e9s ne sont pas moindres! On en a pour notre argent! \n\nLe tout se d\u00e9roulant dans une ambiance agr\u00e9able et l\u00e9g\u00e8rement tamis\u00e9e, un ptit fond de musique et un personnel bien sympathique. \n\nUn petit conseil, si vous \u00eates plusieurs(plus de 2 ou 4), le mieux est de r\u00e9server car c'est un endroit qui a du succ\u00e8s. \n\nEnfin, tout ce que je peux vous dire c'est : GO! Testez le! C'est un incontournable!"
1,Oh my goodness oh my dayuuuum. This place is delicious. There free appetizers are better than most places entrees. A must eat place when in vegas or new york. Lobster ravioli was amazing.
0,Any bakery that is by appointment only should not have a huge marquee and have posted on there doors that it is appointment only.  And then when you walk in look around confuse a man with a box of raw meat shouldn't treat you like a hobo looking for a place to squat
0,"Hung over?  Need a GIANT bowl a Pho no matter what the exorbitant price?  This is your spot.  Not particularly spectacular, but passable enough.  Still feels detoxifying and hits all the right flavor profiles.\n\nHowever, this 3 star review got bumped for AWEFUL service.  Took forever and the staff (both hosts and servers) were less than welcoming.  I felt like a cow going to slaughter.  We were treated with the equivalent amount of respect as well.  Hospitality needs some work."
1,"Meh on the atmosphere.\nWHOA to the food.\n\nWent here on a Saturday night with a friend to grab some grub before going out. It was a nice night so I opted for outdoor seating. I did this after seeing the interior of the place. Per the name, I expected to see a place decked out in New York memroblia, photos, newspapers, jerseys, etc. but sadly it looked the inside of a Pizza Hut. Nothing exciting on the walls, just booths and tables. Although the space was big and the bar looked pretty stacked, I wasn't impressed with the inside.\n\nOn the back patio, which had iron tables and chairs with a bar playing the Giants game (there's the festivness I was looking for) we ordered a side of Honey BBQ and spicy honey mustard boneless wings. OH SWEET MERCY, they were good. I love me some boneless wings and they were killer. I drank the kool aid and I am now a believer of why this place is proud of their wings.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the California Clucker. Chibata bread, grilled chicken, bacon, a mayo of types, and avacado. Served with wide-cut steak fries, it was delish. THe bacon was a little too crispy for me, but the avacado was just smushy enough. I couldn't finish and saved half for a late night snack. Even hours later I was 100& satisfied. \n\nI'd go back here on a wing special night and just eat my little heart out."
1,"I just bit into the mole street taco.  Delicious.  I've lived in Puebla, Mexico, the birthplace of mole and La Condesa's is the best mole negra I've had outside of Puela.  This little restaurant is a wonderful suprise in this otherwise unassuming part of 16th Street."
1,"Yes, the owner of this shop is a bit curt and unwelcoming.  And the turnaround time on some of the items is not the fastest.  However, the work I've had done there -- by both the owner and her employee -- has always been very well done and sturdy.  I recommend this shop!"
0,"I said all right after reading a couple of the better reviews... I don't need hand holding and I am not high maintenance.  I called for a small tile job in a low end rental property.  The first call went great.  After that, completely and utterly downhill.  Unprofessional, unethical, and disorganized.  Scheduled for measurements (which I paid $50.00 for), guy didn't show up.  Called, Marie said she forgot to tell him about it.  Re-scheduled.  Guy went and took measurements.  Was supposed to get a bid the next day, in the morning.  Called, Marie was behind.  No bid.  Called later in the day.  No answer.  Texted Marie.  Said she would have it soon.   Evening, no bid.  Called.  Marie said she was working on it, gave me a deal on my tile.  Um, wrong tile.  Marie texted me a bid.  Measurements were over 100 sq. ft higher than what I had measured, not including the extra 10% of tile needing to be ordered.  The next day, I finally got the bid.  Called several times throughout the day, no answer.  Next day, called again.  Finally someone answers.  Marie is out of the country, she has no idea what is going on, has to find my paperwork and will call me back.  At this point, I threw in the towel and decided I didn't trust them to actually put in the tile and do a decent job.  I called someone else to install, figured at minimum I could still get the tile from them, the prices were good.  The new installer told me to go to Floor and Decor, prices were better.  Service was better.  Done and Done.  Went to Floor and Decor, picked out tile at $.16 cheaper per sq. ft, bigger selection, better tile.  New installer at the house now laying new floor.  Done and done.  You are welcome AZ Discount Flooring for my $50.00.   Lesson learned.  What a headache."
1,Went to Cowtown today to pick up a pair of work boots and my experience was splendid.  The service was excellent as was the selection of footwear.  I went to the boot barn after to compare the prices and saved myself a nice amount buying from Cowtown.  I will revisit them next time I'm looking for some new boots for sure.
1,"We absolutely LOVE Lied Childrens Museum, every single time we go in we discover either an area we missed, a new way of playing or doing something, or like this last time a whole new exhibit. Lied, goes above and beyond what I would have ever expected. My four year old son spends hours playing with the various stations. As a Mom standing by while he connects the piping to make something work, tries over and over to make the ball go the right way, tries to stop the mini tornado, tries really hard to make a basket from the wheel chair, plays car repairman on the little Toyota, airport worker, bubble blower, grocery store cashier, plays in the tree house, and our new favorite playing with the abundance of Tinker toys is such a rewarding experience. Although, I am usually on the floor with him pushing him a little further to understand. Looking for new ways to not only expand their minds, but let them work those imaginations is tough, but at Lied its all in a single visit.  We bought the family membership a month ago and it has already paid for itself and them some. \n\nThe volunteers and workers are always so cheery and just excited to get down and play with the kids. My son and I's favorite is Krystal, who every time we come in is always so happy, and gives off amazing energy! \n\nMy nine yr old loves Lied too, and is always entertained. =) So pack up some lunches( they have indoor and outdoor picnic areas), and be prepared to spend at least two hours of fun!"
1,"One of my favorite places to stop for lunch. The service is quick and efficient. The food is tasty and prepared super quick. If you're near Pitt's campus and need something quick and delicious, Gyros on Forbes is definitely worth the try. It opened relatively recently and I've quickly become a regular. \n\nI am completely satisfied with special 1 or special 2, but I'm planning on expanding on the menu soon. Their homemade pastries and sweets are totally worth trying!"
0,"20 years dinning at sushi restaurants and this place makes the list as the most destructive.  I cater sushi, been making it for 20 years, buy fish from all over the world.  Blue Ribbon is an establishment whose sole agenda is to con you into spending $200+ for a basic meal.  It's Vegas, likely your pumped up on adrenaline or alcohol and you do not notice a serving of $8 salmon is ONE PIECE.  Normally it is two pieces.  $16 for an average serving of farm raised salmon is a crime.  Most I have seen it, wild, primo, is $8.  I can buy super premium salmon from New Zealand for $20/lb, that is 16 $8 servings at Blue Ribbon !!!  For better fish !!!!!\n\nWhat I have expressed so far is just the beginning of YOUR bad experience here.  The Sake appeared to be watered down with added sugar.  I make my own Sake, I understand the product.  And a GLASS of Sake is a SHOT GLASS for $15.  This is also a crime against the customer.\n\nIn addition what I ordered was not delivered.  The chef serves the profit, NOT YOU, and when confronted BS's you into shutting up.  Except in my case I understand Japanese food.\n\nThis place should be avoided at all cost.  You will wake up in the morning upset and feeling used - because you WERE USED.  I have never been taken advantage of more then this scam house.  My experience in Vegas was damaged."
0,"I went to Baseline Dental for cleaning and the annual x-rays. The last time I went there was in summer of 2012. I have no issues with the Dr. Payne and the Hygienists, but I definitely have an issue with their communication on charges for something as simple as a filling. \n\nIn summer of 2012 I was told that I needed 2 fillings and that I would only have to pay $48 out of pocket, while my Insurance will cover the rest of it. The amount they quoted seemed reasonable (I also double-checked with a Dentist friend of mine who runs her own practice in NY). I get the work done, and a month later the real drill begins!\n\nI started getting letters from their collections department saying I owed them another $218. This is after I had already paid them $48 that they told me I owed when I got the treatment done. I paid that amount the day of my treatment and thought I was done! Magically, a month later, they realized they needed to charge me more! I called my Insurance company and was told that the Dentist is charging more than the normal amounts, and that the Insurance will only cover what's reasonable! \n\nMy issue is that a) Baseline Dental needs to charge competitive rates, charges that Insurance company won't refuse to pay, and b) If they get turned down by the Insurance company, stop harassing the patient who actually paid the amount they were asked to at the time of the treatment! \n\nOf course, I called numerous times in Fall of 2012 to get this charge off, wasted hours as I got transferred from one department to another. Baseline Dental wants to rip off their patients so bad (either thru the Insurance or directly harassing the patient), that last year they filed collection on my account for the $218. Luckily, my credit history is really good, and this hasn't impacted me much. However, I am severely disappointed at the greed a business can have, and how this greed and their practice of over-charging has turned a regular patient away! \n\nNote: I still live within a mile of this business, but refuse to go back there as a result of their unprofessional behavior. I will be going there one more time in person to sort things out, but after over a year and half of this battle, I wanted to share this with yelp and get the word out!"
1,"This is a very good restaurant. The atmosphere is beautiful; very well decorated. The set up with the fountain is amazing. The servers are very friendly and very nice. Extremely helpful if it is your first time at a Brazilian steakhouse. \n\nNow, the food: everything in the salad bar was delicious. The salads, the mushrooms, the pasta, the soup; excellent. Along with Fogo de chao, this salad bar is quite possibly the best in town. The meat...now, I am not a connoisseur of steak, but I could tell a difference in not only quality of the meat, but also the taste from other Brazilian steakhouses. The overall quality of the meat seemed lower than at other places; I felt it to be quite rough, even though I asked for medium cooked slices. By comparison, fogo, and even Fleming's, was very tender. It was okay at best in terms of quality. In terms of taste, I found the ribeye (sniffle) to be salty! The RIBEYE! I literally had to spit it out, it was that bad. The lamb was salty as well and it irritated me. The New York strip steak and filet mignon were dry...VERY dry. This saddened me even further :(\n\nHowever, the top sirloin was amazing, I could eat that all day...\n\nAll in all, via is a good place to eat... But for the price, I don't think it's worth it; for $50+, fogo is the better choice."
0,"Been here a couple times and really want to love it ....but just can't.  \n\nLunch this week was just okay.  Our server Jill was very enthusiastic and efficient.  For some reason this place is noisy in a very annoying way.  We endured clinking, clacking and other such kitchen/bar distractions during most of our meal.  Try having a conversation!  \n\nWe ordered meatloaf sliders w/ fries (I know, at an Asian place no less!) and pad thai.  The sliders were okay but at $11.95 not a value.  Pad thai lunch-portion was $7.95 - a bowl of noodles w/ some chicken & shrimp and a few onions & shredded carrots.  I guess next time I want \""Asian\"" I'll go all the way to a Real Chinese restaurant.\n\nOn the upside, I counted 7 different kinds of sake on the menu.  If you're a sake drinker, maybe this makes up for the so-so food?"
1,"Ahh, me thinks Tesco at Dalkeith should take lessons from their people at the Musselburgh store. The check out operator was a tad on the sullen side.\n\nT'was here to pick up some food for dinner tonight."
0,"Meh exactly meh. Ive been here twice over the past 2 months or so....The first time there was a screaming kid there the entire time. Not the restaurants fault right? Yea technically i know but after 45 min of it, when the whole restaurant is visibly uncomfortable the staff should have requested the child be taken outside. Food was okay, nothing spectacular and that damn screaming kid...Jesus people, Chucky Cheese is at the other side of the shopping center. \nSo, i didn't diss the restaurant due to that experience. Went back a few weeks later. Christmas Day actually. Twas earlier in the day so it wasn't super busy yet. The table beside us was already noticeably frustrated with service and wait for their food when we arrived(they eventually ended up almost walking out). Good sign right, lol? Well everything was kinda disappointing. Service was shotty, food wasn't that good(or hot) and took forever to get to the table. It felt like asking for a refill was an annoyance to the server. No bueno, not for me. Next time ill pass."
1,"I'm not big on steaks - but this one do serve very good, tasty ones! We were staying at the Wynn (on comp of course!) last 12/2-12/5 and decided to try this one out one night.  Decor was subdued but when you walk in, you know there's a theatrical feel to it --after all, the dining room walls and ceiling folds and lights changes every half hour! Hence, the name Switch Steakhouse (wink!). Service was up to par - since I did not write this review right when we came back -forgive me but I totally forgot what we had for appetizers-but I do remember we had no complaints! I do remember what the main meal was- filet mignon bone-in! with side dishes of wild mushrooms, veggies. Let me tell you that the meat was truly like butter! We also shared lobster tails - two medium size ones. Those were delicious also and cooked just right. Needless to say, no desserts for us! too full and happy---and yes, we did ok in Vegas--I actually did not even spend all my 'gambling allowance' but with $200 left over--hubby was ahead by about $300...so overall, a good trip over there. By the way, Wynn is beautiful and the room we had was really nice and large--service was very good."
1,"I've always loved cattivo, in that sort of neighborhood bar kind of way. I've never really gone here looking to meet girls, so I can't speak to that, and I tend to drink early and leave before it gets crowded. Maybe that's why I like it so much. The bartenders are nice and the happy hour crew is a good mix. They'll make me a pizza or a calzone with no cheese, and that's kind of a big deal for me. Their dough is my kind of perfect -- crispy on the outside and not greasy, but chewy. Ever since they made the switch to mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce, the salads have become a meal on their own. I don't come here as much these days (living on the top of the hill and no longer having a girlfriend who lives right across the street), but I sometimes miss those days."
0,"This place was ruff on my stomach, I got the yellow curry here.  I heard about this place on yelp because me and my friend wanted some chinese food.  \n\nWell the place is clean and my friend said that his dish (Orange Chicken) was just ok,  After I was done eating I felt my stomach screaming 'WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN YOUR FRIEND'.  \n\nThere is also a pei wei in the same area and I wish we just went to them because it is a bit better quality then this place.\n\nI even had it a couple hours later after the meal cold, and I dont even know why I just felt like giving it another shot, but nope it was still making my insides hurt.  \n\nRecommendation: I would try somewhere else unless you hate your stomach,and if you do, try something else then the curry."
1,"Very good sushi and not too expensive. Off the strip in Chinatown in a small, quiet restaurant. A great escape from the noise of the Strip. Worth a stop if you want good fish without having to deal with the typical vegas scene."
0,"Literally the worse meal I have ever had in Vegas....ever.\n\nI reaaalllly wish I had looked up the Yelp rating before we ended up here, but we were hungry and my phone wasn't working, and it is a chain, so I thought, how bad can it be? Mistake #1\n\nMistake #2? Ordering the lobster...I know, I know, ridiculous to think I would get decent lobster here, but my husband knows I love it and again, I thought, how bad can it be? BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD First of all it was 22.99 and I swear the two lobster tails were each the size of my husbands finger. If they hadn't come attached to shells, I would have thought they were large shrimp. They looked terrible, but I was so hungry, so I gave it a shot. First one, WAY WAY overcooked, took two bites to finish the whole tail. Second one? Took one bite and thought \""I am going to be throwing up tonight\"" It was horrific, and made my stomach lurch immediately, so no finishing that one. \n\nWhile the lobster was definitely the defining bad moment of dinner, I will also add that I asked for garlic mashed potatoes instead of baked potato, got baked potato, had to ask for the mashed and once they came my stomach was so rocky from the lobster, I couldn't eat much, but they were pretty salty and not that great. Also asked for rolls, three times, finally got them and frankly that was about all I ate just to have something on my stomach. \n\nSooo, the best thing I can say is, I did not end up sick that night, which I feel is some kind of a miracle given what that lobster tasted like. I guess I will add that my husband's burger was fine, so there is that I suppose, but I refuse to give more than one star to this place. The staff was nice, but incredibly slow and like I mentioned above, screwed up my order and really didn't want to bring those rolls. Dinner was $50 and I am still insanely irritated that we even paid it. I should have talked to a manager, but we just wanted to get the heck out of there and try to salvage the rest of our night. \n\nDo yourself a favor and DO NOT eat here. You could pick up a candy bar from the store down the street and have a better dinner."
1,Pizza is Always Hot and ready never need to wait! Taste good for the price of $5 pies
1,Delicious sushi! Lots of variety. Good drinks. Great for lunch and dinner! Full bar. Also they have coupons time to time on GroupOn. Would recommend.
1,"Delicious food, Awesome Customers Service,, and Delicious Food.  Oh, I already said that.  lol.  You can go and taste it yourself.  Yummy.  I\""m addicted :)"
1,"New Zealand Cafe is a treasure hidden in an old strip mall.  The food is good and inexpensive -- a great combination, in my book.  Sushi is one of those things I am always hesitant to order (although I usually enjoy it once I do), so I have yet to try any of NZC's offerings in that area.  However, their bento-box esque dinners are delicious.  For $6-10, depending on your selection, you get the main entree, two chicken skewers, two crab rangoons, rice, and a salad.  It's hard to beat that value, especially when it tastes so good.  I especially recommend the Fantasy Shrimp (with a unique, delicious fruity mayonnaise sauce) or the Crispy Scallops.\n\nThe only reason I New Zealand Cafe doesn't get 5 stars is because the inside is cramped, which means that the lines can be long and the dining crowded if you don't feel like take out."

0,"So Sage was booked the night after a tremendous meal at Tao.  After reading the reviews we were both very much looking forward to the meal/experience.\n\nI'll begin by stating the service was \""top-notch\"".  Probably one of the best I have ever had in my 36+ years.  Our dinner reservation was on the early side, 6:30pm as we had a 9pm show and wanted to allow enough time.  We arrived on time and were promptly seated at a very private table for two towards the back of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself is very attractive in a dark, purple sultry type of way.  Now with that out of the way, the reason we went here in the first place... the food.\n\nUnfortunately this is where I truly feel, it was just \""ok\"".  If I'm putting down over two bills for dinner, I want to at some point be blown away by the entire meal, or atleast one of the items experienced.  Once seated and having reviewed the drink menu, we started with our drinks.  I was in a beer mood so went with the Sierra Nevada on draught, and the gf went with a pino grigio.  When the drinks arrived, my beer was only half-full and was issued an apology that the draught system is having problems, and I would need to select a beer off the bottle menu.  Not the way I was looking to start off the meal.  After going with a different selection and review of the dinner menu, I opted for the 4 course chef tasting and the gf went with the halibut.\n\nThe choice of bread was good, as we both went with the bacon infused and the amuse that arrived was just \""ok\"".  Some sort of jelly that was pretty much tasteless.\n\nMy first course was the beef tartar which was good and a decent enough portion to share a significant amount.  The second course was the scallops.  They were cooked fine, but honestly the portion size was a bit ridiculous.  Two very very tiny scallops.  I mean verrrry tiny.  Third course was the 48 hour beef belly.  LET DOWN.  This was about 98% pure fat.  Pretty much inedible.  As normal the course was brought with a separate meat knife.  Unfortunately the only use was to try and find any meat at all in an entire plate full of fat.  Even writing this review now, i can't believe that was served as one of the courses in an $80 4 course menu.  The fourth course was a warm carrot cake with cream cheese ice-cream.  I'm not the biggest carrot cake fan, but the gf is and I didn't much care for the other dessert option.\n\nThe gf had the halibut for her main course.  It was a nice piece of fish, however, when you drop close to $50 for a piece of fish, what you don't want to hear is \"" it's good, but I can do this just as good at home\"".  Problem was that she was right.  There was nothing spectacular or anything to set this dish apart from a very fresh piece cooked at home.\n\nWould I eat here again...no.  Would I recommend anyone else to go who has only a brief period of time to experience vegas dining....no.  Was this meal worthy of the number that arrived on the bill... not even close.\n\nHad two very good meals at the same exact price point while out there the last three nights ( Tao, Emeril's ), and unfortunately Sage was quite a let down when it came to the food."
0,"Sub par.  Too expensive for too little mediocre food.  Not likely to return.  Beans are soupy and taste like dish water, better suited for a straw than fork.  Salsa is horrible.  One small mediocre enchilada for $10.  Sat on patio which was very nice.  Staff not at all attendant, such as soda glass was empty for more than 5 minutes with them frequently walking by.  Finally after waiting almost 10 minutes asked for and got my check."
0,"They don't honor refill discounts here. Apparently it's at the manager's discretion. Let me explain why this irritates me so. Throughout the day, I'm in all different parts of Las Vegas. One of Starbucks' great competitive differentiators for me is that they are everywhere and I can get my iced tea refills throughout the day with a refill discount. (I usually grab a breakfast sandwich too.) This keeps me a brand loyal customer. I can only deduct that this manager is desperate to increase revenue in any way that can be had. I politely walked out without completing my order. I will take this location off of my route."
1,"We found Bobbee O's during a stop in Charlotte on our way from Ohio to South Carolina. The restaurant is an unassuming store front with a small, bright dining area fronting a massive kitchen, complete with black box smoker.  The three of us ordered:  two pulled pork dinners with sides and a pulled pork/brisket combo with sides.  Portions are massive, the meat selections filling half of a large styrofoam take-out box, the sides in their own containers, with buns (or bread) and a small container of sauce on the top.  The pork was tender and juicy with vinegar tang.  The sauce was rich and like the meat, had just a bit of kick.  The brisket was some of the best we had ever eaten, with a dark smoke edge and moist and well-seasoned  beef.  The mac and cheese was different and delightful.  Sweet onion added depth while a bit of heat came out at the end.  The coleslaw was sweet and chopped instead of shredded, and the collards were flavored wth the crispy pork ends.   We had trouble finishing off our meals, making us sad we were staying in a hotel where we couldn't wake up to leftovers for breakfast.  A side note on the service:  although the dining area is utilitarian with plastic tables and chairs, Bobbee and his kitchen staff made sure we had everything and checked in several times to make sure we were pleased with our meals.  You can bet that Bobbee O's will be on our list the next time we travel the I-75 corridor.  We've had \""Q\"" all over the country, and this truly was some of the best we've licked off our fingers."
0,"This place is so gross!  Stale bread, rude employees and a boring sandwich makes for a place we will never visit again. Sorry jimmy you will never see another dollar from me.  Go to jersey mikes it's way better!"
0,"This place was just not good, that's all there is to it.  I waited for 30 minutes on a very slow Monday afternoon, and their thoughts were to stick me at a chair and let my feet soak.  Lukewarm water ten minutes into the waiting, I knew this was a lost cause.  The place was not inviting, I thought the interior was very tacky, trying way too hard.  Pedicure was rough, not hurtful, just not gentle and very rushed.  Manicure same thing, very very rushed.  I only tipped because I'm a decent person but if I didn't have a soul I would have considered not tipping at all.  Save your time, go somewhere else."
1,"Came for a HH and stayed for dinner.  I really enjoy the atmosphere (minus the fact that it was very warm and a little too loud), but I really like walking in and seeing the large windows and open kitchen.  It's almost like walking in to fancy barn or greenhouse with tables inside!  Tables can be put together to accommodate large crowds and the service was very good.  \n\nWe ordered a pizza that had mozzarella, eggplant and garlic, and the malfadine (rock shrimp, home made pasta, delicious!) which were both very good.  Hopefully they'll fix their air conditioning issue (or maybe I'll just wait to go when it's not 118 outside!).  But I'll be back for some more fresh Italian goodness.\n\nNote: there is no parking, and is valet only, but at least its complimentary!"
1,"I visited this place with visitors from Hong Kong and China looking for a break from American food. We decided on this place based on reviews of having an American menu and a Chinese menu. The direct response from our expert visitors was the chicken was good, the vegetable was too sweet, noodle with beef needle a little more flavor. All in all difficult to compare to authentic Chinese food, but was a welcome treat for weary Chinese travelers missing home."
1,"Tried the Mahi Tacos. Served with beans and rice. Rice was good but the beans were nothing special.  The tacos were refreshing.\nMy only complaint was the owner/manager had a bit of an attitude and kept criticising the servers, who I thought were doing a fine job."
0,This is your standard Mexican restaurant serving a standard American audience. It is extremely cheap given it is in an off the strip casino.\n\nThere really isn't any reason to eat here unless you are at the Tuscany and do not want to travel anywhere else for food.
0,"I have been a subscription customer of westfield comics since the late 80s, with a couple of hiatus(es) while in graduate school or moving around the country. Sadly, I am canceling my standing orders due to poor customer service and failure to answer my questions via email. Its a serious decision because now I'll either have to figure out which of the dwindling number of comic stores in my area will pull titles, or find another company online. I am giving them 2 stars because up until now, I had a great experience. Kind of feels like a betrayal after approximately 25 years, but I'm a big boy with a nice income to spend with a better company with better customer service."
0,"Again, the hotel provided a 2-for-1 appetizer coupon here, so we indulged before heading out for the night. The place was mostly dead, save for a few families and their annoying children. We didn't dig the menu all too much, and we weren't all that hungry, so we just ordered 2 appetizers and a bottle of sake. Our waiter asked, \""Is that all you want?\"" using the kind of tone that suggested I was maybe cheap for not ordering more. Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe you have some kind of mental ability that allows you to know my innermost thoughts and you're assuming I didn't order as much as I really wanted to. Do me a favor: just take my order. Maybe I didn't want to order a $20 sweet and sour chicken entree that probably tastes marginally better than the combo meal at Panda Express. Sorry to waste your time with my paltry order, jackass. For what it's worth, our two appetizers, potstickers and won tons, were mediocre at best. Both tasted like the kind of cheap frozen appetizers you'd buy at Albertsons. Luckily, the sake made the meal worth it. But I thought the staff was impolite. I won't say they were totally rude, but there was an air of arrogance I detected which fouled up the evening. Add in obscene prices and I can't think of a single reason to waste any time here."
1,"Came here for restaurant week 2012. $50.12 for 3 course dinner.\n\n5 stars for the Bellagio fountain view.\n3.5 stars for the food. \n\nVenue: Decent sized restaurant with great view of the Bellagio fountain when you sit outside.\n\nService: was good. Server constantly came to check on us and helped us take multiple photos :)\n\nFood:\nComplimentary Bread and Olives (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=QGy2akDArGCERH9U9bqUqg) - OMG their Breads are sooo good and i think they are fresh baked in house too! I had to ask for seconds.\n\nJumbo crab salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=S5coFUVVZqdl6_mr0nMwUA) - This salad was really good!! It had large pieces of crab mixed with. Great Presentation.\n\nVegetarian tart (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=lj3RPIjbpfPvoh2sAm3_Jw) - This one was very tasty as well. Tasted like a thin crust pizza with thin slices of squash on top.\n\nBlack cod (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=tHt9c087_EdPqod0x1xgNg) - The cod was moist and came with some mashed potatoes. Overall this dish was slightly better than mediocre. \n\nMascarpone strawberry cheesecake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=reYczOIuUb05FHpvPO1OXQ) - This one was pretty decent. The cheesecake was dense, but I still had better.\n\nPrice: I wouldn't pay more than $50.12 for this 3 course meal. \n\nOverall: This experience was well worth it to have such a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Food was just okay... But good deal for the price."
0,"Tried to rush us out, waiter who sat us down never returned to us with an answer to our query. Ordered the seafood noodle dish which was bland, cold in parts (i.e. Squid and prawns). Rice porridge was a nice change to the usual Chinese menu and the next server did ask if we whisper for side plates / bowls so we could share our food which was a nice little touch. Small but varied range of beers (three comes to mind). Overall a very disappointing evening, based on a recommendation of a befriended flight attendant."
0,"Yuk! Edible, but not good at all. We were in the mood for fake Chinese tonight and had a flier from this place. We ordered quite a bit, and no one really liked anything. Egg Foo Young--overwhelmingly garlicky. Crispy Noodles with Chicken--the same style of noodles that you get out of a can. You get the idea. \n\nThe second star is due to the fast service. \n\nWe had been considering ordering carry-out from Mandalay Noodle World, which we tried a few days ago and liked a lot. But, not finding a menu online, we went with this place. Big, $45, mistake."
1,"One word: Wow.  What a great place to eat!  My wife and I are big Gordon Ramsay fans, so I insisted that we visit the new place for dinner during our last trip to Vegas.  We were not able to get reservations because the pace was booked for the whole weekend, but we did find it relatively easy to get seats at the bar.  The bartender was absolutely great.  She made us these drinks (cant remember the name) with muddled blueberries in it, antioxident something or other, that was oh so good even to me who does not enjoy fruity drinks (whiskey please)!  Since it is one of the favorite things for Ramsay, I had to try the Beef Wellington which more than lived up to my expectations.  My friend had the New York strip which he said was excellent, and my wife even had some kind of gourmet baked potato (always watching her already outstanding figure).  Prepare to bring money though, our tab for 3 people was over $360.  Good thing we were in vegas so I could try and win some of that money back!  I didn't."
1,"Really enjoyable eating at this place, it's runned very well...service is great.  And the burgers are awesome.  Very laid back atmosphere and you leave there feeling full."
0,"A quick trim and she did an okay job, but I had the impression that my stylist would have preferred to be taking a break instead of cutting my hair. I'll get another stylist next time.\n\nThey have an app so that you can check in when you're on the way, so you don't have to wait."
1,"When you're running out of date night locations and your significant other is getting tired of Domino's cheap weekday carryout deals, it's time to treat her to a fancy restaurant. Preferably one that constantly offers $20 for $40 online coupon deals like Cajun Queen does.\n\nThe location is very nice - it looks like a converted home with outdoor patio seating and an enclosed back porch for when the weather is nice. There's live music most nights and a bar upstairs if you just want to sit and enjoy a cocktail or two while you wait for a table.\n\nThe food was excellent - we got the Cajun BBQ shrimp as an appetizer and couldn't stop raving about it. Save your dinner rolls to mop up the delicious juice! Ask for another basket when they drop the shrimp off! We ordered gumbo too just to splurge but it seemed bland in comparison to that excellent BBQ shrimp juice.\n\nI always feel bad waiting sitting through a waiter's shpeel about the daily specials and not ordering one so I ordered a steak special and my lady got chicken Diane. The steak was cooked medium rare as requested with craw fish etoufee and hearty mash potatoes riding shotgun. The chicken Diane's gravy was rich, flavorful and tasted fantastic. The portion sizes were enough to feel full and take enough home for meals the next day.\n\nThe service was excellent as well - our server was very personable and friendly. He make jokes, answered our questions about the menu, and never kept us waiting long when we needed something. \n\nThe entrees at Cajun Queen are around the $20 range which makes it really easy to blow your Groupon for a date night. In addition, there's a $5 charge for splitting an entree. I'll definitely be buying another coupon for Cajun Queen. The prices are a little beyond making it a regular spot (even with a coupon) but it's perfect for a memorable date night."
1,"I have very tiny nails and so it can sometimes be difficult to fit acrylics to them. Not with Michelle! She skipped gluing a tip on and just sculpted them out with acrylic. They have never looked so beautiful in my life, they are so cute and dainty (but still strong). Aside from my fantastic looking nails, Michelle was a blast to chat with. \n\nI should start by saying she texted me all week trying to get me in (as a first time client) at a time that works with my busy schedule. This goes beyond what I expect from a business into downright brilliant customer service. And then within seconds of meeting her, we were having a naturally flowing conversation, which I have never experienced at a salon because most are filled with predominantly non-english speakers. She is just the loveliest person.\n\nI'm sorry, this review is so long, but I have so many great things to say about the salon. I'll list them now:\n\nMichelle is the best. The rest of the staff is also the best. Michelle is an artist with nails, not just a technician. The spa is adorable. My nails don't feel like clunky acrylics, but like dainty little extensions. The staff is committed to your satisfaction. This is my go-to salon; I will not stray."
0,"I went to Cadillac Ranch on Wednesday 5/8/13 with 3 friends. The reason we chose CR Tempe was because they have a great patio overlooking a stage at Tempe Marketplace where the winner of \""the voice\"" would be singing that night. We were told it was going to be a 25- 30 min wait for the patio- not a big deal. 45 minutes later the hostess finally takes us to get seated and she tries to put us at a table on the back patio. I asked to speak to the manager (since I told her we came there solely for the good view of the stage and good service) and miraculously we were sat at a front patio table. Our server was actually great- she made sure we were taken care of and was happy we were sat in her section. To be clear-this one star review has nothing to do with her. I ordered the sliders with chipolte ranch, my friend ordered a salad with chipolte ranch, and my other friends shared the tacos. The food was pretty good and the concert was awesome. It wasn't until later that night I found out that something about my food was actually not good.Around 1:30am I woke up with a very upset gargling stomach. It wasn't long after that until I got sick. I was sick all night and only got about 3 hours of sleep. The next morning I felt a little bit better and got ready for work- since I am right out of college, every minute of work counts. I got to work at 8am and at around 9:30am my stomach started acting up and I had to leave work for the whole day. I am losing money on my next paycheck because of Cadillac Ranch. I believe they owe me a day's worth pay. I'm still only able to eat bland foods and now instead of getting together with friends tonight, I get to go home and sleep to get over this. Yay fun weekend for me.. not.  So take it from me- do not go to Cadillac Ranch for food unless you want food poisoning and your weekend to be ruined. I will not be returning anytime soon, if ever."
1,"Oh... my... lord. \n\nWent to Savor Scottsdale's Notorious P.I.G. event at Digestif and can't even put into words how great everything was. All the credit does not go to Payton Curry, as each course was from a different chef and a different part of the same pig, but WOW. Chef Curry was certainly the entertainment for the evening, with personality that just doesn't quit. And having him gush to our table about his Easter Sunday menu, beginning with carrot soup, ending with carrot cake, and everything rabbit in the middle, I will certainly be visiting Digestif more often. We've also seen him at the farmer's market, picking out the freshest produce he can find... it's not just a schpeel, this guy is serious about utilizing local ingredients.\n\nAnyway, back to the pig. Every course was made to perfection, half of which I had never heard of before... and paired perfectly by Todd Bostock with Dos Cabezas wines. I could go on for pages, but suffice it to say that you all should support your local chefs and watch out for more great events from Savor Scottsdale, a non-profit organization working to put Scottsdale on the map as a culinary destination.\n\nProps to Chef James Porter of Tapino, Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Chef Brandon Crouser of Atlas Bistro, and Chef Tracy Dempsey of Cowboy Ciao, et al. They can whip up the most amazing dishes from the most obscure ingredients. Did I mention the trotter salad or bacon ice cream?\n\nhttp://thedish.freedomblogging.com/2009/04/27/photos-notorious-pig-dinner-at-digestif/6939/"
0,"I recently had dinner at Carnevino with 4 friends.  While I've eaten in Batali places before, this one really takes the torta on overpriced food and fussy/condescending waiters and service.  Being from NY, I don't take kindly to snowjobs -- and this place was all about that.  \n\nOur server, a dweeb from LI to boot, who made lots of chit chat with us at first, was all about getting us to spend as much $$$ as possible.  He was good with the stories \""aged beef, so carefully prepared...be sure to pick up the bone and gnaw on it - like Mario would do if he was here.\"" Oh pleeze.  So pretentious.  The tale of the cannoli prep was the best, as another server made up seemingly compelling stuff as he went along.  I was anticipating and fully ready to vomit up my overpriced meat in response to the line, \""each cannoli shell is carefully rolled between the nubile thighs of 16-year-old virgins\"" if it came to that. And in Vegas, that'd truly be a rare thing.\n\n\nAfter having 3 small pasta plates to share, we went on to the mains. And, by the way, one of those pastas, the penne with anchovies, was about the worst thing I've ever tasted and should be fully avoided. They push the steaks, but as we were two couples, we could have saved some money with ordering one steak to feed 4 of us.  Mr. Server Douche never bothered to mention that the Florentine Porterhouse steaks are big enough for 4 people.  Nope.  He just had us purchase 2 steaks at the cost of $80 PER PERSON!!  The menu is misleading, as we thought it was $80 for 2 - not EACH.\n\nBasically for me, this restaurant \""jumped the shark\"" in every way and it'll be a long time until I eat in one of Batali's joints - anywhere.  Figures he's friends with Goopy, by the way.  Ugh."
0,"The food is good, but that's the only redeeming quality. The seating \nis cramped, you will always get bumped into by one of their obnoxious \""regulars\"". The waitresses will never get your order right unless you just order fries, and even then she will get you the wrong kind of beer. The waitress is more concerned about getting you out of there than trying to up sell on dessert or another round of drinks. Don't bother bringing ANY kind of coupons or gift certificates, the staff will argue with you about accepting them (don't bother telling me that I didn't read the conditions on the coupons, I did read and totally understood that you cannot use coupons during happy hour, we ordered food AFTER happy hour and our coupons were still not accepted). And lastly, I want to add that I worked in a couple local bar/restaurants and currently work as a waitress in a major strip casino, so I am very forgiving with any wait staff that I come across, and already have the mentality that \""the customer is always wrong\"", but the staff is horrible and rude. Mark Riche's and the Chinese place next door are WAY more friendly and appreciative of your business."
0,"Have had breakfast 3 times here in the past year, each time the bacon was a greasy undercooked mess. Once the over-easy eggs were nearly raw. The rest of the breakfast was just ok. The french press coffee is pretty nasty, don't use the last half of the pot or you will need to chew the coffee. Nearly $30 for two people at breakfast."
1,"My go to spot for curry and pad thai in my neighborhood. There are very few places that I visit on a consistent basis that make me as happy as a trip to Archi's does. It is my guilty pleasure without the guilt.\n\nLets start off with my favorite dishes. \n\nThe yellow chicken curry is a balancing act of perfection. A carnival of different flavors melded together to make one kickass curry. Throw in some potatoes, onions, and carrots with whatever meat you desire and you have a hearty delicious meal on your hands. Choose your desired spicy level, give me a side of rice, and I'm done!\n\nNow the pad thai is easily one of the best pad thais I've ever had. It is not some fancy rendition of pad thai with overcomplicated ingredients or an unnecessary presentation. It's pad thai, with a side of chopped peanuts and baby sprouts. That is it. It does not need to be more than that.\n\nI will say that not all dishes are created equal at Archi's. Their fried rice is just not that well put together. It looks delicious but it just really falls short on the flavor department. And another shortcoming of Archi's is their inconsistant spice level. I usually order a spicy level of seven but it will vary wildly from mouth scorcher to somewhat mild. I think it depends on who is preparing it but make sure to keep that in mind when ordering.\n\nDespite the complaints, Archi's still goes down in my book as a solid place to get some pad thai or curry."
1,"This restaurant is interesting, and I like it!\n\nBasically you can get some general chinese food, wonton soup and an egg roll...or you can get a nice sandwich, with your choice of lunch meat ranging from turkey to pate to smoked salmon.  To accompany your sandwich you can add a salad, and you can even mix two salads.  The Clafouti just sales a little bit of everything...even hard boiled eggs!  You can walk out with a sandwich, a medium salad and a drink for less than $10.\n\nThe food is good, quick and convenient.  I think they make their salads daily.  Highly recommend for those looking for a quick take out lunch around square victoria."
0,"i am really wondering what perception altering \""enhancements\"" people are on when they wrote these positive reviews about loving this place!  this place is run by a bunch of slimeballs who only care about money.  when you own and operate a business that is supposed to be relatable for a specific part of the population, it's important to stay true to the purpose.  the customer service of this, dare i say, business is severly lacking.  in a place that should be a judgment free zone, you are judged the moment you walk in the door.  i will say that the drag show was fantastic and kudos to the queens who were in it, they have nothing to do with the other happenings at the Free Zone.  if you want to see the drag show, i encourage you to go!  maybe have a drink and once it's over, leave.  you'll contnue to have a better time elsewhere."
0,"Somebody recommended this dog sitting company to me.  I called to get an appointment, but did not get a return call for days.  I had to write everything out in writing what I wanted.  I put down the hours I wanted, and figured everything was taken care of.  I had the girl take a picture of my dog while she was there.  I luckily noticed the time, and it was hours before she was supposed to come.  What a big disappointment.  The simplest things were screwed up from the beginning.  I would never use them again.  Also, after numerous requests for my key back, I still don't have it."

0,Machines are very old - many out-of-order. Premises not very clean.  A tacky place.  Will not go there again.
1,Great food great service! I've taken multiple friends here and have recommended it to lots of others who enjoy authentic Thai food! Love Thai House!
0,"Their customer service is great and the place is nice and presentable but as far as their work goes, it's not the best. On top of their work not being the greatest, I have never seen them sterilize their tools. I've been there several times because they are my last resort when I need something done last minute and out of all the times of been there (6?7?) not once have I seen anyone pick up new/clean tools from the sterilizer. I asked once if they sterilized and they said they did yet I've never witnessed it."
0,"Have always enjoyed the Mediterranean food and very quick service here. However, the past two times my boyfriend and I have been to Aladdin's it has been bad news!\n\nSeveral months ago we were eating dessert and in the middle of the German chocolate cake we were sharing, we found a big green spot of mold!  So this means that the cake was old and/or stored at an incorrect temperature... gross either way.  The manager took the dessert off our bill and that was it.. no offer to discount the check, etc.  Think about it, we ate half of a piece of moldy cake that you served us.. not charging us for the cake is a  NO BRAINER.. but what are you going to do as a way of making this better? They did nothing and I don't like to make a scene so I let it go.\n\nA couple nights ago, recovered from the mold incident, we tried Aladdin's again.    But, my Kibbie was ice cold in the middle and had to be sent back.  It disrupted our meal and was an overall bad time.  Again,  no apology or offer to make it better.  \n\nI think management needs some retraining on how to make someone's bad experience OK again.  We have learned our lesson this time and won't be back; which is a shame because we used to really love it there."

1,"I ordered 225 mini cupcakes for my wedding and they were fabulous!!! Their tiramisu cupcakes were to die for and my guests enjoyed the classic and the tux as well. We sampled a few other bakeries in Madison and Madison Sweets was the winner hands down! \nLet me reiterate that the cupcakes were absolutely delicious! However, their timeliness to respond to questions and follow through with placing our order could have been done in a more timely fashion. Other than that, they were a delight to deal with."

Sheets were clean but had holes. Missing light bulbs, broken light fixtures, carpet in the living room so dirty it was gross. I had to call for them to send me over a room service book! WTH?! Bath tub drained very slowly and a nasty stench would waft up from the shower drain. YUCK. Will never stay here again. EW EW EW!!! Trying and failing to be Upscale...So Ghetto!!! :::shivers:::"
1,Andrea and George are the bomb!  Used them for both boarding and day care and felt very comfortable leaving our (2) dogs in their facility.  George also helped socialize our Doberman and made him comfortable with other dogs during their visits.  We drove 30+ minutes one way to visit these guys primarily because they are one of the few kennel/cage free facilities in Vegas but grew to trust them completely with our babies. Our dogs could not wait to go to K9 and it became a home away from home for them.\n\nThanks George and Andrea for taking such good care of our pups! Best of luck with expansion plans. \n\nHighly recommended!\n\nTodd & Sandra
0,"Snobby Service!  I came here to listen to music in the bar.  Shortly after we arrived, we were briefly acknowledged by the hostess, seated ourselves (which is fine), but then we were ignored for 20 minutes.  Fed up, I went up to the bar to order our drinks.  The bartender wouldn't even look at me and I had to walk back and forth around the bar to get his attention.  He was not even doing anything!  The drinks took about 10 minutes and they were just draft beers.  I ordered a tiramisu from the waitress, who finally showed up after about 45 minutes.  The dessert arrived after 30 minutes.  I have never seen such a pathetic tiramisu.  It was smaller than a piece of toast and about 1/2\"" thick.  This place is ultra yuppi-ish and frankly, I think the reason for the bad service was because we rode there on bicycles, but I was dressed pretty much like everyone else in the restaurant.  What a bunch of snobs!  I wish I hadn't left a tip, too.  I won't come back again to this place.  Watching the parade of yuppies going in and out of the place was entertaining, though."
1,"Took our son and daughter-in-law and their two little ones (9 and 6) to see Mac King this past weekend. What a great show!! The kids thought it was great fun, but I think the adults enjoyed it even more than the kids. He is incredibly funny, engages in a really fun way with the audience, brings young ones into his act, and he's an amazing magician. We think he's a great talent!\n\nSee it, well worth the modest ticket price. We'll certainly see him again.\n\nMichael I."
0,"I think anyone who gives this ore than 3 stars must never have had a decent burger in their life. You  can't tell me with a straight face that the burgers here are better than Five Guys, In-N-Out, etc...Sorry, they just aren't.\n\nThe decor is nice and there are TV's everywhere, including at every booth. That's a plus. \n\nThe staff and hostess were very nice and I thought they did a good job.\n\nBut the food lacks. The $16 Kobe beef burger is bogus. There was no difference between that burger and the $9 angus burger my friend had.\n\nWe had the skinny fries and sweet potato fries. Nothing special. Period.\n\nWith 2 sodas, tax and tip, $55. NEVER AGAIN."
0,"I'm seriously so over sprint. Spotty coverage, half the time my apps don't work because of low coverage... dropping calls, etc. Not to mention messing up payments and bills.\n\nTonight, however, I'm livid. My iphone died and I plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes. No luck. I tried two other chargers and still nothing worked. So I took it in to the store.\n\nSome employee with blondeish hair and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted annoyed he even had to help me. I explained my problem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but \""if its anything more than that, youre gonna have to wait\"" Ummmm ok, rude.\n\nHe told me it was working fine and that I could just buy another charger if I wanted. No, I'd rather not waste my money. I got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now, and it's still dead.\n\nSprint might want to have knowledgible employees when it comes to Apple if they're going to be dealing with iPhones. Guess I'll head over to the Apple Store for help tomorrow. Sprint and their employees are useless."

0,"My assumption is that this place is supported exclusively by dog lovers.  It sure can't be the food.  I came here for lunch and got a pizza and salad combo. \n\nThe pizza was bland but tolerable (the old \""pizza is like sex\"" joke is apt).  However, the salad made me feel like I had teleported back to Iowa in 1973.  They use ONLY iceberg lettuce on their salad.  What sort of restaurant does that in this day and age?  I thought maybe that it was just the side salad that was this way, but a coworker got a \""Fajita Salad\"", and it was also just iceberg.  The fajita salad appears to basically be iceberg and cheap-looking grated cheddar.  It also had a side of chicken and grilled peppers and onions, but those looked rather sparse.\n\nThe atmosphere is a bit too Disney-ish (read: juvenile) to make this a good bar to drink at, and the food is pretty mediocre.  Again, I have to assume that people who are obsessive dog lovers cannot resist coming here because there are so many adorable dog photos on the walls.  I, however, am just a dog liker.  Therefore, I can and will resist Uncle Bears."

0,"I am very particular with customer service. Being \""born and bred\"" in retail, i expect great results.\nMy first visit to HYVEEs was on March 20th,2011, accompanied by my 79 yr old mother and my 21 yr old son. I was actually excited and the chef in me is always pursuant to great finds.\nUpon entering I came into the produce department.  Seemed to be a nice selection but the prices were scary. Not entirely the retailers fault i am sure.\nWe perused the isles for items that were needed at my mom's request, and I must say the demographics are not very easily navigated.\n\nI did alot of pricing comparisons also, and I must say there were few deals to be found if any. Especially on SEAFOOD. wow they were way overpriced.\n\nThe worst part of our experience was when my mom needed to purchase a Cranberry Juice. We entered the food isle where the juice was located and there were two employees, one holding a device, chatting about work. My mom was having a hard time locating a Cranberry Juice Only Brand. I was trying to help and the horrible thing is, is that this woman employee (the other employee had moved on at this time) heard us in our plight and was standing no more than 4 feet from us, and never acknowledged or asked if we needed assistance after at least a full three minutes of our obvious scanning back and forth amongst  the shelves.That was just plain bad customer relation.\n I realize grocery stores are not a typical full service establishment, but she did work for HYVEE, not a scanner from an outside company.  She could have assisted or been aware and at least said something.\nI never experienced one employee during my visit who smiled or looked the least bit friendly. It would have been nice to at least get a \""hello\""  somewhat like the HYVEE commercial portrays. \nI won't be back for the reasons of way overpricing and lack of customer service. Many other places offer both."
0,"My friend's club promoter friend were able to get us into XS for free, and he also said he'd be able to hook us up with free drinks at Blush at 11pm so we dropped by here after we had already gotten admission into XS.\n\nBlush is called a \""boutique club\"" for a reason - it is on the smaller and more intimate side.  There's one long bar area and some booths with a very small dance floor.  The crowd here is mostly older - I saw A LOT of cougars on the prowl.\n\nAs for the free drinks, it wasn't quite what we expected.  We thought it was unlimited alcohol of any sort, but they were only offering free CHAMPAGNE to the women.  You had to get a wristband and be on the guestlist to get the champagne.  Eh, I guess champagne counts as alcohol, and nothing beats free.  This place definitely cannot compete with XS, which is just down the way in the same hotel (Encore)."
1,"Love the atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious pastries! Highly recommend! Great place to relax with a cup of coffee and your laptop."
1,"This was my first Yelp Elite event and my first chance to meet Risa, as well as some other great people! What a warm, lively, fun, creative and delicious way to spend a chilly Sunday night! \nI'm going to try to write this review without using too many exclamation marks, but that'll be a challenge. \nDanielle, the glowing hostess, was on fire in the kitchen! I mean, she whipped up individual stir fry plates for every single guest (and there were a lot of us), hot and beautifully presented. And, THOSE PEANUTS. Seriously - I don't even really like peanuts but I was even grabbing a handful on my way out the door despite being already painfully full. Where were they from again?? Also, it'd been a while (like many, many years) since I'd had tempeh, and I now feel like I've been missing out! I'm definitely going to go back to check out Noble Bean, our tempeh supplier for the night, housed just upstairs from Cuisine Culinaire. Who knew?! Now we do. \nInstead of waiting in line for stir fry, I decided to go to dessert first and sample some of the cookies brought in for the swap... and really didn't even know where to begin with those... There were sooooo many good cookies and such a variety. Thankfully I had my partner with me so that I could just take a bite of one to sample it and hand off the rest to him to finish for me. Ha! Cookies for days. What a FABULOUS idea to have a cookie swap. Everybody got to leave with something. :)\nNow, Cuisine Culinaire is one of over a thousand community kitchens in Quebec, so we were told, and this blows my mind! Quebec wins! It's really good to know about this place, and I hope they have a website, because it would be awesome to go back for a cooking class sometime!"
0,The ladies that were working today\nWere almost skeptical after I used\n2 coupons like the coupons were\nFake or something so this is where\nMy issue is \n1 uninformed employees\n2 as I ordered they never asked\n   Was there anything else so they\n   Just kept telling me the price when \n   I wasn't done ordering \n3 They didn't bother to ask me was it for\n   Here or to go until they had it all together\n4 just all around inept customer service
0,"We wanted to grab a frozen hot chocolate for a late afternoon snack. Well, the wait at 4 pm on a Monday was so long for 2 people that we ended up eating dinner. I had the veggie burger, which is housemade and served with a spicy roumalade and avocado slices. It was really, really good. The sesame bun was grilled crispy, but the inside was soft. Probably the best veggie burger I've had.\n\nI got the Cole Slaw as my side and it wasn't good at all. It was the prepackaged, mayo based kind so unless you like that kind of thing, stay away. I tried a few of my friend's fries though and they were good.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was disappointing though. I have not been to the original, but my friend had and she said it was not the same. It came out melted and didn't have the strong, rich chocolate flavor I was expecting.\n\nOh, and we sat outside (on the patio facing Las Vegas Blvd) in June (it was in the 90s) and it was hot, but not uncomfortable. I actually enjoyed the water misting fans."
1,"Yum! For all those skeptics who fear trying vegan cuisine, this is the place to start. I have not had anything on the menu that I disliked, and you would never know that these dishes are completely free of animal products. The Green Burger and the Mexicali Burger totally satisfy my need to chomp into a big ol' burger, which I occasionally miss since I became a vegetarian. The Drunken Mushroom \""Chicken\"" Bowl is amazing. All of the vegan \""meats\"" and \""cheeses\"" they use at Green are awesome. They even sell some of them in their mini grocery store so you can take that vegan deliciousness home with you. And the desserts... oh, boy! If you haven't tried it already, go now!"
0,"Just order a Bring It On Burger,the meat was so dry ,the lettuce was old and turn bad already! The meat taste like cooked 2days ago and than reheat when someone order\uff01"
0,"I really try to be understanding about food taking some time. I am very willing to wait for quality food. Its actually my tagline for yelp...however, this place takes too long to get my to go chow mein out, I mean...its chow mein! I order it because its quick.\n\nWouldn't be so bad if it were better, or I could get the guys behind the counter to give me duck sauce at least.\n\nBTW, what is it with Chinese places and duck sauce? They seem to act as if they have never heard of it, every time. Although it says 'duck sauce' right on it. If you only get it when you order duck, fine. Tell me that, I can accept limitations. Its just when there is a blank stare or, even better, a \""We don't have that\"" (when I can clearly see it) that annoys me.\n\nYou get a good amount of food, its pricey though, a drink and dish, not a combo, are over $10. Again, if it were better..."
1,Food was excellent as always!
1,"Been a couple times but last Sunday was nuts! This is a place to see & be seen, foreal! It's a place where you get to see just about everything Vegas has to offer... my wife & I just kick back and gotta laugh at some of the naughty things we've seen here, especially on the dance floor.\nGreat venue but they really shouldn't have placed the DJ booth in-between the dance floor and pool view. It cut off one of the major veins to outside so the side door was one big traffic jam.\nCover is $30 for girls & $50 for guys but you can talk your way down if you got females with you (unless they're fugly!), just see one of the line hosts. Also try to find passes on the strip, which may or may not work. The line is usually long but it moves swiftly and be prepared to WAIT for drinks too. If you find the right spot on the inside dance floor ceiling AC vents will point right at you... find those spots!"
1,"White Boy approved tasty Mexican treat! \n\n5 Caliente Peppers! \n\nThe Al Pastor tacos are oh so delicious. This street taco restaurant is friendly, fun and clean.   \n\nDrove through from the Hoover Dam trying to avoid traffic. Worth including in your plans."
1,I like to come here to focus on a project.  Great coffee house vibe.  The staff clearly likes being here.  Everything is unique and delicious.  I had the soup of the day.  Baja chicken.  Excellent!!!
0,"Can somebody please give me a tongue scraper??? Quick! The taste (or lack thereof) of the crappy $9 bloody mary is piercing my tongue! One of the things that irks me the most, is when you go to a restaurant, spend ten dollars on a \""signature\"" cocktail and it tastes like garbage. \n\nIn this case it tasted like water tomato juice, with a sprinkle of pepper. And a massive celery stick that engulfed the glass. \n\nSo you say, you should drink beer when you go to these places. You're right! But then don't put crappy drinks on the menu, just to fill up space. \n\nAll in all, we are in Scottsdale after all...there are a million places to go that have more to offer.. \n\n\nI left after the drink. You got me at \""hello?\"" No, not so much."
1,"THE BEST crab puffs, hands down."
1,"Live music, mind-blowing performances, and hilarious innuendos are only half of what to expect from this show. This is my second Cirque du Soleil show (first was O) and as expected, the performance was spectacular. Couple of tips: Don't ever buy the tickets at their original price, because you can always find discounts. Merely 1 week before the day I was due to arrive in Vegas, I used the main Aria website and their Summer discount to get SECOND row seats for only half the price. Sitting so close to the stage really does make the difference. If you're going to see a high quality show then only the best seats will suffice."
0,"If you play any kind of miniatures wargaming, you've heard of Battle Foam.  If you haven't, that's because you're new to the hobby, don't know about the hobby or are that cheap bastard that stores his minis in pistol or rifle cases...or you're really hard up and make do with cardboard boxes and egg crate foam (hey, I've been there, I don't hate).\n\nProducts are great.  \""For gamers, by gamers\"" and all that jazz.  Some of their trays are awesome, others need a bit of fine tuning.  However, my issue lies in their online ordering.\n\nI ordered a PACK for my Trollbloods warband.  Battle Foam had the exact loadout I wanted and it had a few 5-star reviews.  Coming from other gamers, that's high praise.  Placed my other on January 10.\n\nWaiting.\n\nAnd waiting.\n\nGuess what, more waiting.\n\nToday (1/31/14) I go to their website to check the status of my order.  \""Awaiting Fulfillment\"", whatever that means.  If the foam or PACK was on back order or something, I would have appreciated a call or email (since I gave you both forms of contact information). \n\n I could have ordered this from Steve at the War House and paid his small markup and have this by now.   Hell, all it takes from Steve is a call to Berkeley (or whomever he uses as a distributor now) and maybe a two week wait.  This three week \""pending\"" order is getting ridiculous.\n\nGreat product, but pretty piss-poor execution.  Get to together, guys."
0,"I've always wanted to try this place and I personally wouldn't go back. Food was OK, def get something bbq b/c it's better. I had the wings and they sucked. Being treated like s*** was interesting but they prob could do w/o that angle if you ask me. The atmosphere was cool and they guy working the bar was super cool! He totally sold us on getting one of the insulated cups with the slushy drinks and he did his own mixture that none of the refills could beat down the strip. I would do the outside bar again but that's about it."
1,I was recommended by a coworker and this place is great! Won't be going anywhere else! Not only do they do a great job on designs they don't make you feel uncomfortable for asking.
0,"The cashier/hostess Caresia must've been having a bad day. She was not friendly or personable at all. The food wasn't good. I ordered the strawberry cream cheese french toast. There was so much cream cheese, whip cream and artificial strawberry sauce that you couldn't enjoy the French toast at all. It was soggy. No need for syrup at all because it was so sweet. Definitely won't be going back to this place. The only thing good was the hospitality by the waitresses that's why I give it 2 stars."
1,"ok, I yam eating here cuz the Yelp machine told me dat dis here res-taur-ant is good eatin'"
1,"Best burger I've ever had and best burgers on the strip! I'm very picky with my burgers but these are perfection! Everyone in my party of 8 were very happy with their meal. I loved it so much that I almost went there a second time during my trip to Vegas. I recommend getting the truffle parmesan fries with your burger..so good! I would also recommend the hummus and Maui onion rings for appetizers. The hummus is super fresh and unique tasting and the onion rings are to die for! Don't plan on being seated right away and they do not take reservations. You put your name in and they text you when your table is ready. In the mean time, you could walk around the miracle mile shops which are right next door or gamble a bit. The food is definitely work the wait!"
1,"Best snow cream in town! I had the Mangozilla last week with a friend, and it was a great treat before going out for the nights festivities. I definitely will be back for the Panda berry...looks too good to pass up."
1,"This is my favorite venue for entertainment.  I went to Maragaret Cho here and all of the seating is very good no matter where you are at.  We paid for a higher price point ticket which was at about row 19 towards the center section.  Staff are friendly, the vendors prices are  a bit ridiculous,so passed on any libations and got some afterwards.  I won't fault the Dodge for this directly but the vendors contracted.  Crowds also tend to behave not as trashy as at US Airways or Cricket pavillon which is a plus"
0,"What happened to you, carnival? Almost 10 years ago, they were my favorite buffet. Seriously, the flavor, the options, and the service - it was all there. My plates were cleaned, the flavors were immense, and damn, were the desserts heavenly.\n\nFast forward now - even for their price, which is consider on the more affordable hotel buffets, just leaves me with a stomach that hurts. I like that they have so many options - seriously, you'll burn some of the calories just walking back and forth, searching for your table because you were too hungry to remember as you dashed to the seafood station. The taco station is a nice visit if you're interested in making your own tacos, hard shell and all.\n\nThe dessert station, which I used to be quite fond of, is now mediocre. It's like everything is just tossed together - no flavor. Just loaded with sugar and HFCS. The gelato is good, but I would say that about many other buffets serving gelato.\n\nYes, the lines are long. I never had a problem in the past because for the most part, I went through the Diamond line. And the few times I waited in the regular line, it was at odd times, so I barely waited. The wait isn't an issue - that's bound to happen at many other popular buffets."
0,"I'm not going to lie, I fell asleep maybe 3 times. It was hard to keep my eyes open. I don't know if it was from lack of sleep, drinking all day or just pure boredom. I'm gonna go with probably pure boredom since when I looked around the people to the right, left, front and behind were all sleeping. RIDICULOUS for a Cirque Du Soleil show. The story line was somewhat hard to follow. Alot of battles and fighting. I thought there would be more acrobatics and just anything to make my jaw drop and go WOW! Glad I only spent $66 on my tickets on smartervegas.com\n\n\nI've seen Zumanity and that was a WOW show,definitely recommend that over KA. KA is more of a broadway type of show than anything."
1,"I reserved a RT service for my sisters bachelorette party to be picked up when we arrived and for the return. \nThe pick up was great he had my name displayed and was very helpful with our luggage. I don't remember his name but I'm horrible at remembering names. Some how he managed to fit all 6 of us women's luggage into his trunk, and we don't travel light I might add. Also, he was helpful in getting my other sister, who was to arrive at a later time that day, a earlier service than reserved for her. Even though we were running a tad bit late and we just told him last minute that there would be 2 hotel stops instead of one, he didn't mind at all. Overall airport to hotel was great. OH did i mention the bottle of champagne we managed to finish at 9am? \n\nFor the ride back was just as pleasant. I had reserved a stretch limo originally but they didn't have any available at the time of my pick up, so they showed up with a stretch Cadillac Escalade Limo! I wasn't even mad :) . The driver Ralph Z was very nice and attentive. I only remembered his name because he gave me his card. Any ways, he gave us great conversation the whole time and understood us (but us I mean me) being a bit ill that day, so we made the ride as smooth as possible. He even took pictures for us by the limo and told us we needed to pose and everything. I enjoyed the ride.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience to and from. Presidential Limousine is a great place to reserve your services at. I'm never taking a bad cab ride again! I will definitely being using PL again.  Hope I was helpful enough."
1,Great place for lunch or dinner Grimaldi's thin crust coal brick oven pizza is awesome.
1,"Put some fries and hot sauce on that chicken shawarma wrap, it's called Sultan style.  I'm just kidding.  I just made that up... don't say that to the cashier, they will be confused.  But you should still ask them to put fries and hot sauce on your wrap, it's a nice touch.  Thank you My T for the tip brosky!\n\nThis place has really bad reviews.  Granted service is not like you're going to get at Robouchon, but cmon, it's not that bad.  I really like the fatoush, it's more authentic than most places in Summerlin.  The chicken shawarma was great.  So juicy, not dry at all, I'm surprised at what everyone else is saying.\n\nI will come back!  Someone mentioned waiting 15 minutes for their food?  Is that really that bad?  Cmonnnnnnnnn"
1,Favorite shawarma in town\nHard to decide between the chicken and beef\nPrefer the plate
1,"Great Pittsburgh Happy Hour! $5 dollar apps and dollar off tap beers.\n\nThey have a wide selection of draft beers, so if you like to enjoy flavors other than Miller Light this is a great place to go and enjoy some IPAs at a good price.\n\nWide selection of $5 apps too. We ordered the BBQ Nachos, and they were amazzzing with multiple z's! I crave them all the time now.\n\nGreat service too. Our server was happy and excited to be there. She made the atmosphere more fun.\n\nGet there :)"
1,I was in the market or a new Computer and thought I would give them a try. I went in and talked to Mr. Cady about my options. He showed me some models that where out with Linix on them. I checked them out and was very impressed!!!! I did not know that with Linix you get free  software. So they built me a new computer that I have been using for about a few weeks and I could not be any happier. Thank you Redseven
0,"If a negative review was possible I'd post one. This is a shame of epic proportion. Firstly, cost... Register gal tells me it's $20/30 for local gals/guys but visitors pay $75 and up. I recommend people say they're locals. Then it's loud, smoky, and drinks are much overpriced. Drop $595 on a bottle of grey goose... Seriously!?!?\nDoorman says show gets started around 11:15 so we show at 10:30 to get a good spot to watch stage. No show till after midnight!  And really didn't start till around 12:30. Then it's short, unimpressive, and uninspired vignettes. Boring. \nFrom a guys point of view, the serving gals were hot, but If I'm dropping this much dough, someone better be getting naked. I've paid less at high class strip clubs!\nOverall, I feel ripped off, lied to and deceived about this production. Sad at MGM. Sorry they got behind this hot mess."
1,"Family owned and in my neighborhood. Everything, and I mean everything, is delicious here! Get in the car right now and go there! Try the manicotti or chicken piccata or the mussels...yum!"
0,Met up with friends recently at Fez. Have never been a huge fan of this place but it's been a few years since my last visit. Nothing has really changed. Food isn't all that great or special. I do like their drinks menu. Only thing truly special about Fez is Monika Avalos!!!
1,Had breakfast two mornings in a row while visiting the area. Great staff and excellent breakfast. It is supper cheap also.
1,Chicken nachos....wings....football....cold beer!  Love it!!
1,"I was admittedly nervous about everything to do with purchasing a new home and especially having it financed with all of the new restrictions in today's market. However, Matt Baker made it truly simple and precise. I can not begin to express how knowledgeable and professional he is throughout the whole process. I would and do whole-heartedly recommend Matt and his team to any and all of my friends and business partners. Thank you Matt!\nGreg P."
0,"I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give two stars.  Probably closer to one.\n\nI was flying back to the LA area and hadn't eaten anything all day, so when I got to the airport with lots of time to kill, this was the first sit-down option available with a table.\n\nI ordered a coke with a taco salad with steak.  The coke was OK but crazy expensive ($3.60).  The salad came and had some scary looking steak in it.  I took a picture with my iPhone ,but haven't uploaded it to Yelp yet.  I will later.\n\nThe flavor was rather bland.  The guacamole looked packaged and overall it wasn't very good.  The entire meal was kind of nasty.  I should have gone to burger king!\n\nJust say no to Jose Cuervo."
1,Any and every frozen drink you can imagine lives here. This place was a God send. My friend and I walked into this place everyday while on our vacation. The frozen drinks were definitely welcomed since it was extremely hot during our Vegas experience. I can't wait to go back.
0,"The people at the front desk are always on their phones, watching tv or talking to each other. I was waiting to get checked in when there was 3 LA fitness workers standing around talking with each other, I ended up just walking in with out getting checked in. Not to mention their intensity cafe totally sucks at making protein shakes. They are bland and almost pure blended ice with no flavor! \nI make the extra trip to workout at the LA Fitness in Scottsdale from now on."
0,"Umm, what did I just eat? 9:47 pm and I had a sweet tooth, it was way in the back lol. I had just taken my kids to Baskin Robbins a few days earlier but I didn't get anything that' time, my kids really loved it, but they're kids lol. Anyway I call them up to see what time they closed and to my surprise they were still open, close at 10 pm. I'm there in 5 minutes and decided on my favorite ice cream of all time, Butter Pecan. It was disgusting, extremely flavor LESS! I'm not sure if it was the ice cream or the cone but there's a burned taste in my mouth, never again will I go there, the employees were nice though...  My 2 scoop waffle cone was $4.56, not to expensive but I still want a refund."
0,"I have been taking my three kiddos to Gilbert Peds since they were born. I have since decided to find a different pediatrician for them. \n\nWe started off with Dr. Auxier but after he kept asking me why I was not Mormon any more and saying that my husband would be a great priesthood holder, we decided to change doctors, giving the practice another shot. \n\nWe started seeing Sam Shumway, and he appeared to be just amazing. I referred tons of people to him because I really did like him. The last visit we were at I was there for my 3 and 4 year old. They both had ear infections and strep. I asked him about my 2 year old and he just checked her over since we were there. I asked him and even offered to schedule another appointment to take care of her if need be, but he did it as a favor since I was already there. Pretty awesome if you ask me. Before the end of the appointment, he does what he usually does, he looked me in the eye and said if I need anything, call him. \n\nSo the next day, when my two year old that he just checked over spiked a fever, I called and left a message. The nurse, who had been completely flat out wrong anytime I have ever asked her for advice, tried giving me advice but had no clue that Sam had looked over my little one the day before, as it wasn't notated. Totally a favor. No big deal, I ask her to please have HIM call me since he would know the situation. A few hours later, the same nurse called me back and said that Sam was slammed and couldn't call me back and continued to give me advice even though she didn't know the situation. Moral of the story, he didn't honor his words when he said to call him with questions. Honestly made me feel like he isn't truly a doctor who can provide care for my children. Bummer. \n\nWe have since been black listed because of a balance past due. They didn't have my new phone number, and I was too angry to call and pay the balance. But the other reviewer who said he was blacklisted is credited because it happened to us too. We are paying it, but it's a sure sign that this is no longer the place for us. \n\nThe billing lady, Jamie, is awesome. But the front staff is always dry and the nurse is dead wrong every time. Once told me to Rush to the office because my son had \""RSV\"" which ended up just being a cough, and another time said that my daughter, who was 4 months old just had a cold and it was no big deal, I finally took her in and she had double ear infections. \n\nA big bummer, but I am optimistic that we will find a pediatrician who seems like they actually care about the kiddos."
1,"J2 Cleaning did an outstanding job of cleaning my carpet and floor tile. Charles was absolutely wonderful! Jesse came out to give me a quote and Jeff set up my appointment. Everyone was so pleasant and professional. Mike also stopped by to help stretch my carpet in two rooms. I had several cracked tile and knew they probably would crack again if replaced. Charles used a filler and they look 100% better.  I will never use another company for my carpet and tile cleaning needs, trust me they are the best! I should also mention their rates are more then fair.\n\nMaryellen Amaro"
1,"My coworkers have raved about this pizza place I finally went with then for lunch. \n\nWe were greeted promptly, asked for our drinks. Nice atmosphere with a taste of NYC.\n\nThe waiter came back and took our order. We all opted for the lunch special of pizza, salad and drink. The salads came back a few minutes later and was a good size with a nice vinegarette. \n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the pizza arrived. I really enjoyed my pizza. I ate my personal pizza quickly. I wish I had more.sausage on my pizza. That would be my only complaint that each slice had maybe 1 or 2 bits of sausage. \n\nService was very good. We were in/out within 45 minutes.\n\nThis will be a place I will head to for lunch often! Great pizza at a great price."
0,"I won't go back. Here's why. \n1: Misdiagnosis: One doc I won't name couldn't figure out what was wrong with me on one occasion so she writes 2 scripts, recommends tests, and sends me on my way $120 lighter for the visit, plus $130 in script costs. When her scripts fail to work I snap a picture of the problem and send it to a family doctor / Hospital Chief Of Staff we know in Nebraska. She immediately diagnosed it, recommended over the counter stuff and I was healed in 72 hours. And when I told the COS what the scripts were she laughed and said Seriously? She gave you THAT? You wasted your money! \n2: Book a 15 min appoint to make sure you cover your issues, she rushes through and doesn't seem to really listen to you. \n3: Won't renew even simple scripts for $4 meds without an expensive doctor's visit. \n4: Loves to make referrals and especially to labs. Lots and lots of lab work. \n5: Front desk staff: Overworked and it shows. \n\nIn short, Las Vegas healthcare already has a bad rap. This clinic does not help the perception problem one bit."
0,"Staff was outright rude.  They were condescending, never apologized once for the wait.  Also saw crickets and roaches near kitchen and in bathrooms which made me want to vomit.  Unless you want a roach roll do not eat here!  I will be spreading the word that this place should be condemned!"
0,"The food was great, the service was to amazing, drinks even better. So I suppose you're wondering why I'm giving 2 stars? The poor staff is stretched so damn thin there it's disgusting. My friend and I went many times when we were there because of their vegan menu. It was tough a couple of times service wise. But one time our waitress (who was such a sweetheart! I don't remember her name but she was a lovely, thin yoga teaching girl) was trying so hard to make sure we got our food and drink in a timely matter. The bartender was too busy not paying attention to the orders, and then they ran out of margarita stuff! We were there for punk rock bowling, and I guess the manager (who you could tell was there wearing some hideous lilac colored shirt, really dude?), was too busy sitting on his phone to notice his staff was running around trying to do the work of 5 people per person. \n\nLong story short, food is awesome, drinks... awesome. The waitstaff, fantastic. But man, I hope they're more prepared next year so I don't have to wait 30 minutes for my food and or margarita."
1,"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this gem! I was browsing through Yelp and they had a deal $10 for $20. The reviews were good, so I bought the deal. I am glad I did. I have been to Thailand and love Thai food. This place had Kana (Chinese broccoli), it wasn't listed as a side, but I requested a plate of it and they delivered. It was good. \nThe best part of the meal was the Tom Yum Kai. It was like what I had when visiting Thailand. The lemongrass really shined in this soup. I loved it.\nThis establishment offers Issan style food, which is a great benefit and sometimes hard to find. Duck is all over the menu, which is a bonus as well. \nEverything we had was delicious and we will definitely be back."
1,"I was expecting something out of Austin Powers but felt like I could have been at a bar at a beach in San Diego.  I was there on a Friday night and it was busy but not butts to nuts like you'd find at a place on the strip.  The beer is a little pricey.  $5.50 for a Newcastle, but this is Vegas.\n\nParking is a little cramped but I got lucky and got a good spot just as another guy pulled out.  They had a dj playing songs off an apple laptop and he was playing a good mix of stuff.  Made me feel like I was back in college when he put on Crazytown.  When you're here, check out the upstairs area where you can kick back with some pool.  Another interesting note about the Crown and Anchor is the it's the hangout of choice for boxer Ricky Hatton when he fights in Vegas."
1,I absolutely loved this place. Adam was great. So caring about our group.was there with daughter & 3 of her friends for her 25th birthday. The appetizers all down to dessert were good. Filet was tasty and everything hot and well prepared. I can hardly wait to return.
1,"Best mid-range shopping in Vegas - large, spacious with a good blend of mid-range to higher-end labels. Good layout and generally not as hectic/crowded as Forum Shops (dark) or Miracle Mile Shops (trashy). Head to Crystals or Wynn Esplanade for couture boutiques."
1,"Kudos to a great company. If you have looked at any of my posts about other tree services in town, you know that I may have a bit of a chip on my shoulder. That being said, First Choice exceeded my expectations. Great customer service, tremendous follow up/through, best prices I found, and quick turnaround from initial call to completion of the service.\n\nI would highly recommend these guys to anyone. Special thanks to Roe for restoring my faith in Vegas tree service companies. Roe was amazing."
1,"I have been here several times, and I'm from Southern California.  The only time we're in the area is for work.  I travel with about 5 Iranian coworkers (I'm Iranian as well) and this is one of the best Persian restaurants we've ever been to.  Who knew we'd have to go all the way to Scottsdale for amazing Persian food? \n\nThe atmosphere is very elegant and the service is very friendly, even for a large group."
0,"My roommate and I have been residents here since January 2014 and our lease ends in November. We're both working college students and one of us is a veteran. We picked this place for convenience, security, and just to make a place a home for our quiet, busy lives.\n\nMove in process was great. It took us two weeks while other apartments usually take a month. They do check your credit score while you do your application. The whole process is done electronically. Our credit score and rental history were fine, which meant no down payments or proof of income for us.\n\nOur unit is one bedroom on the first floor. Rent and water bills may be paid online through the apartment's website. Electricity is through APS. We have cox, but we were not able to get satellite services because buildings/trees block the dish due to where our unit is placed.\n\nManagement here lacks and their priorities are off.\n\nThey are petty with decor or patio furniture regardless if it looks appropriate or if it doesn't bother other residents. We have a nice wooden working table that had a device on it. They told us to remove it. Tools are not allowed in your patios even if they mounted to the table. At one time we had shopping bags of tools set on the working table. The director, Tina, told us to remove it. It was very unnecessary considering they were still in the shopping bags. We literally just placed them there to put in our storage.\n\nAlso, she saw your American flag and told us to take it down. The reason was because she didn't want other residents to be motivated to put other flags/decor up that maybe offensive or inappropriate. Our flag was in code and we had the legal rights to keep our flag up. However, we decided to put it down because we didn't want management harassing us more for petty things. It was just very disappointing for a veteran to be told to put his flag away.\n\nPools are frequently locked on weekends with no given reason. Not good, especially during the summer. Also, the BBQs are in a state of disrepair and are unusable. In addition, parking is chaotic. They don't seem to give you covered parking spots that correspond with your unit. However, there seems to be a handful of uncovered parking. If you don't use your covered spot, neighbors will assume that the spot isn't claimed by any existing resident and will park in your spot.\n\nFirst floor can be a pain because maintenance use leaf blowers and are constantly blowing debris into our patio. This is a gated community, but the gate/gates are FREQUENTLY broken or \""in repair.\"" Although it's not the worse neighborhood in Phoenix, but it's far from the best. Therefore, the gates are a concern to us and we are paying an extra $100 compared to non-gated communities surrounding the area. Maintenance is not on top of things. The light in our breezeway have been out for weeks.\n\nOther then that, Paradise Falls is affordable, the application process is efficient, and it is a \""gated\"" community, there's security here as well."
1,"If you're in town with buddies and the gals are at home, this is the place to go.   Rooms weren't bad, they weren't big, but seriously now, you're not there to sleep, you're there to gamble.  Food at the 24/7 place wasn't bad at all, for the $ it's a a good deal.  Comps are fantastic, get a card, you'll get a free room, eventually.  People were nice, we were chatting with a guy dragged into dinner with his wife, while waiting in line, not the sleezy feeling you get on the strip.  \n\nDidn't see a roach problem, looks like that was taken care of, having worked as a health inspector yrs ago, someone would have caught that and fixed it.  One place to avoid (just because the food isn't that great) is the place right near the exit where you go out to Fremont.\n\nWill stay there again when I can, worth the time, promised the missus I'd take her to the strip next time so it'll be a while with the guys,"
0,"Boba was good! But I do have to mention the ants crawling all around the inside of the \""pick up\"" window!! Ahh so gross"
1,"Rolled up on a Tuesday night since I had to kill about 1.5 hours while waiting for someone to arrive at the airport.  Old Pewter Rose location (RIP).  Place was pretty busy and since I didn't have time to wait they offered us the counter right at the kitchen which was open.  Kind of like a Chef's table but they called it something different.\n\nThe experience was doubly awesome since we got to watch them prepare all of the yummy dishes.  We were right there facing the line cooks and chefs.  Both me and my co diner ordered the nutty fried chicken on the recommendation of the server.  It was served with sweet potato mash and asparagus.  The entire plate was quickly devoured and I must say it was very tasty.  Oh, and they started us off with one of the most wonderful, fluffy rolls that I have ever eaten.  Since I was right there I noticed a sign that said that the rolls, before being served had to be approved by a chef before going out.  Pretty cool, and maybe that contributes to the hot, doughy perfection that I ate.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience at a renovated old favorite restaurant of mine.  I will definitely return so I can try other things on a menu that I really didn't have time to properly peruse but remember there was some pretty great stuff on it."
0,"Not even worth to try. No complaint for service and I respect that, but food quality was very poor. It felt like all microwaved food...specially when food comes to table in five minutes or less."
0,Good for a beer but that is about it.
1,"I haven't been to many gay bars in Phoenix, so after Yelping my options, I decided on Icepics. It looks rather unassuming on the outside, but once you walk in, the space is fairly large and the bar extends back quite a bit. They have TONS of alcohol here and there's really no drink they can't make. \n\nWe didn't know, but it was happy hour and I was served a pretty heavy pour. It didn't take long until I turned into my cheap-date-red-Asian-glow look. I'd say this visit was a success. \n\nThey have a separate room they use for drag performances, and sad that I had to leave before the show started, but it looks like it would've been awesome. The bartenders are very nice and the crowd looks diverse. Can't wait to go back and get red again!"
1,"This is one of those amazing places that could easily be overlooked.  For more than 14 years, the owners of Cafe Forte have tirelessly made a name for themselves by providing unadulterated cuisine or comfort foods for folks who like their meals freshly made with only quality ingredients.  \nBRAND NEW Comfort Hours from 3-5pm features awesome appetizers like their roasted Polenta cakes!  They also feature $4 glasses of select wines and beers, too!\nOne of their signature dishes is the Cafe Meatloaf with a light burgundy sauce and smashed potatoes.  They also feature many fresh seafood entrees as well as fine Italian specialties.\nBecause the restaurant is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale,  on Main Street, just east of Goldwater Blvd,  you can enjoy the works of fine artists as well as the fine foods at Cafe Forte.\nI recommend  beginning your meal with the baked brie and sliced apples along with a nice Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.\nCasual atmosphere with little votives and a fresh flower on each table is what you will see when you first enter the main dining room.  There is a bar area and when weather permits, an intimate garden for romantic dining.  They also do amazing pies and tortes for dessert.\nGreat for dinner on Thursday Artwalks or for a casual lunch with good friends!"
0,"Another gripe:\n\nWhy is it that most of the bus pass vendors are sketchy check loan centers such as Check City or Money Tree? And at the same time you guys take forever to supply the bookstore at CSN with more bus passes(as of today, they have been out of them for a week).\n(P.S. I'm already aware that they finally decided to start vending them at Alberston's, which, you know, makes sense seeing that it is a grocery store, which is a place that people are more likely to go out of their way for than a fucking Check Cashing place. That's besides my point). \nExcuse me for not wanting to be forced to pay 3-5  bucks more for a piece of paper which you guys already charge too much for to begin with so I don't have to be forced to spend close to ONE HUNDRED dollars in one month on the bus rides I need to get back and forth to school every day. \n\nJust needed to let that out. It always feels slightly better to ride Las Vegas public transportation when you have an outlet to air out your frustrations about it. :)"
0,"I'm always excited for locally-owned restaurants and was really enthusiastic until the food came.  I'm really only giving them 2 stars, because the service was fine, the patio was nice, and the salsa was good.  However, the food was both bland and barely warm.  I read on their website that the owners are part of the Someburros family, so I thought it would be good.  I was willing to pay twice the price for good Mexican in a higher end atmosphere.  My husband joked that the person who recommended Isabels owed us $40 and an apology. Lol!"
0,"We were looking for a place to eat one night and were just going to randomly choose a place, and then we walked by here and saw that it was jam-packed, line waiting to be seated and so we all looked at one another and walked in thinking: \""Wow, the Pho must be amazing!!\""  and... it was ok, definitely not the worst Pho I've had but it wasn't the best either. I guess I just don' t get it because the Pho back home is so much more rich and flavorful, this just tasted like slightly flavored water to me.\nThe service was ok, and the seating is tight so be prepared to sit next to someone who you don't know.  I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't be a in a hurry to return here."
1,"I reather enjoy this place.  The food is overall pretty damn decent and it's not expensive.  The crab puffs are really good.  I wanted to crawl inside of it, camp for three days and eat my way out like a tarantula wasp larva, but I had work....\n\nIt goes without saying, but the service is incredible.  Everyone mentions it.  The lady who works there gave me soup on the house simply because my girlfriend ordered a meal with it and I didn't and didn't want me to be lonely and without something to eat.  That's rad.\n\nAs I was leaving she also gave us free cookies.  Fuck yeah!\n\nEach time I've been here, there've been loud-as-hell people for some reason.  One time I went and there must've been, a World of Warcraft convention in town or something because there was a table full of kids with plastic battleaxes telling jokes with such punchlines as, \""Wookie bowcaster,\"" and \""Purple light sabers!\"""
0,"I just don't get this place.  The atmosphere is trying to be upscale, the desserts look upscale, but they simply don't taste all that great to me.  Totally not worth the money."
0,"They do NOT match their on-line prices, I was NOT impressed.\n\nI reserved a book on-line for my daughter and since I dropped my wife off at work across the street from this location I waited the 30 minutes I had to for them to open.  That was my choice and no big deal, what was a big deal was the attitude when I got inside.  I went the customer service counter to get the book I reserved and was told that it was at the checkout counter, I go the the checkout counter and when it couldn't be found, and I explained that I had just reserved this morning, the sales lady got rather rude and asked if I had gotten an e-mail that it was ready.  I was then advised that it was at customer service.  I explained that I was at customer service and was told it was supposed to be there.  So with continued rudeness I was told that since I had just reserved it on-line, it was still at customer service desk as they had not had time to bring it to the front.  Wow, it must have been my fault for reserving it on line and arriving to soon after-wards to get it.\n\nI asked about the $2.00 difference in price and was told they do not match on line prices.  The \""excuse\"" I was given was their \""overhead\"" was higher.  I was born at night, but it wasn't last night and I do not for a minute by that line of B.S.\n\nFor for these reasons, I'll buy either second hand books or from independent book stores.  I'm tired of corporate America's attitude that I'm here for the sole purpose of giving them my money to make them even richer."
0,"Tabu Ultra Lounge is just Lounge...nothing ultra about it.\n\nIt is disguised as a club but has an inconsistent crowd, inconsistent music, and incosistent bartending (prices change/lie about drink specials/sometimes good drinks/sometimes bad).  Ladies on the one star added for you because if you are looking hot you should have no problem getting in free if your willing to put up with the rest of their crap this could be a good thing."
0,I stopped going to this Einsteins awhile ago but when I was hungry walking by it the other day I just stopped thinking I would give it another chance. Boy I was wrong. Same old Einsteins I always new. The service was terrible and they rushed everything. Next time I need to remember to stay clear of this place and hit up another Einsteins
1,You do not I repeat do not have to be a Beatles fan in order to love this show. It wasn't over the top and it ended in the perfect amount of time leaving you wanting more (just like they taught the bands back in the day). The acoustics were fantastic and keep your ticket so you can get a buy one get one free drink at the Beatles lounge that doesn't play Beatles music. The lounge was badddd. My personal tip get a seat in section 200 or above because the best stunt in the show you will not be able to see if your sitting close.
0,The coffee is great ...\nThe staff is really hurtful... I mean i told him i wanted two ice coffees... And he gave me two hot coffees .. So i said he was wrong  and that guy with the mustach started to curse me (in intalian i guess) REAALLLY??!\nI should have give them 5stars if the staff were really really nicer ...
1,"My family and I are food people. That said,  Osaka is our destination for great Chinese food. After catering an event we hosted and knowing the owner for years, we've grown quite close to this restaurant since it first opened. \n\nOnto a review. Decor is pretty simple, very   Nice and clean, but not too formal. Kids are welcome, the servers are nice. The food is delicious, and I always come here as it is a quick local stop. When I don't want to go out, takeout works perfectly. This is my favorite restaurant in my area. \n\nOnto dishes I recommend. The orange beef or chicken is great. If you don't like your chicken fried or would like to eat a bit healthier, they are fine with a different way to cook it if you ask. Also, the sesame beef and fried rice are great. We always order the string beans too. Every appetizer I've had was great, and I only recall one not-so-great meal there a few years ago with the beef with broccoli because the sauce was bland. The owner will also often come out and talk to the diners, when he's there. Not always though, because he may cook at times or the restaurant is packed (it's busy when we go.)\n\nGo. It is a great experience, much better than what the other people say. Try it!"
1,"Have been going here for over 10 years and always get the chicken bowl. Have never been let down by them, always great service and have never had a problem with my food. Don't like the location all that much and isn't the cleanest place but it isn't dirty."
0,"I really wanted this to be like the one in NYC. I'm obsessed with that one, more than obsessed with their frozen hot chocolates. So, when they use a mix to make their drinks, one would assume they would be close to each other. They are NOT.  They are not only a lot smaller than the NYC version but they aren't as good.  There is something off with theirs.  However, it still somewhat satisfies the cravings when you can't get to NYC every weekend. \n\nIf you can sit outside, do it.  You have a view of the entire strip and that makes it worth a little wait. Just don't eat there. The food in the NYC one was never great, and the LV isn't any different. LV has great restaurants, go to one of those and then here for dessert. If there is a long wait, don't wait around. Go to the bar, order it to go, and get out of there and enjoy Vegas!"
0,"I hate this wal-Mart I hate it! Yes it's wal-mart and well they are always busy and large and what not. But this one is confusing and annoying. It makes me want to punch wal-mart in its face if it had one. The lay out is a freaking maze! Of course I know not all wal-marts are created equal. But this one clearly got the short end of the stick, the drop out, the designer few wish to speak about cause they are \"" different.\"" Well wal-mart needs to bitch slap this lay out into one people can figure out cause right know it's one hot mess"
1,"I have been sending packages back home for several years from this store. The staff are always friendly and helpful, and help me to choose the most cost effective method. I was in there just today, and was helped by Alexis, who was cheerful, and got me on my way happily in no time! Two thumbs up!"
0,"Pretty much a no show, no call.  Tammy set one appointment, rescheduled for another day, didn't show or call, then I found she emailed me saying she couldn't make it. Then nothing!!!"
1,I was with a group of 7 girls and we were looking for a somewhat low-key night. We went to V Bar and it was so much fun! The bouncers were friendly and the cocktail waitresses were really attentive. We sat in one of the lounge areas and never waited more than 5minutes for our drinks. The DJ played great music and we danced for most of the time we were there. The crowd was pretty mixed and all in all it was a good time! Definitely go if you're looking to dance without being stepped on or groped!
1,"Great intimate show! Very talented people especially the beautiful leading lady. Every seat in the house is fine, I sat in the center F section. This is worth seeing even if you've seen the O show. It's a different feel in an intimate setting."
0,"I wanted to give Joseph's 2 stars for the excellent service, but I just couldn't bring myself to mislead anyone into thinking there's even a sliver of a reason to eat here.\n\nThe food, while authentic, was atrocious.  \n\nBoth the chicken and beef dishes had a very heavy, less-than-fresh odor and taste to them.  These were not meats they should have been serving.   \n\nAs I said initially, the service was excellent.  It's definitely a family run joint, and they were so kind that we didn't have the heart to tell them the food was rank.  We politely pretended we were stuffed and asked them to box the rest of our food to-go.   And promptly ditched it in the trash can once we were out the door.\n\nI would have loved to recommend this place, as Las Vegas is definitely in need of some genuine, authentic middle eastern cuisine -- but do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs."
1,"Fantastic wine selection, impeccable service, sublime menu options. Have been many times and always very very good."
1,Really great particularly the tuna tartar nachos
1,"We were told about this place before visiting Scottsdale and decided to go.  We were not disappointed.  The margaritas were terrific (a great selection), and the food was equally good.  It is one of the best restaurants I've been to."
1,Went to Rocco's last night with the family. We had calamari app its was fresh and amazing. My son got a cheese pizza after a few bites of that I looked at my husband and said we should order another to go Lol! I had the veal piccata the veal was nice and tender with a great lemony garlic sauce and my husband had rigatoni zigarati (?)  Very big portion with lots of sausage! We also couldn't resist their pastry counter and ordered cookies and cakes and my son had a personal cherry Italian ice he gobbled that up in no time it even had fresh cherries in it. We will defiantly be back especially since its rt down the street for us! And their to go pizza special one large cheese pizza for 9.99 will go great this summer by our pool! ; )
1,"Baja loco: good food, nice staff, great atmosphere, my favorite is the grilled fish tacos, along with the margarita, it makes a great meal."
0,"I went to the new Salad and Go on Higley and Williams Field Rd. It just opened a couple of weeks ago and was excited to see what it was all about. I ordered the cobb salad and was very disappointed. First there was lots of lettuce and it looked clean and fresh. However the rest of the ingredients were very much lacking: eggs, blue cheese crumbles (almost none), bacon (chopped so fine and spooned on to) and 1 very tiny slice of avocado. There were lots of tomatoes. Since I didn't open it until I got home I was pleasantly surprised at the size. That being said they gave one little container of water downed blue cheese dressing. No way would it have dressed the entire salad. I was willing to pay the $5.69 for the salad but did not get my money's worth with the extra ingredients for sure. I will go back and order a different salad to see if I can get a 5 star salad next time. I would certainly look closely at the list of ingredients and compare it to what you actually get."
0,"Autrefois une bonne adresse \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Aujourd\u00b4hui, une catastrophe en cuisine comme en livraison. 90 mn d'attente pour une pizza \u00e9videmment froide et tr\u00e8s mal pr\u00e9par\u00e9e. Un cauchemar. \u00c0 \u00e9viter ... en attendant la fermeture !  Dommage."
1,The yellow tail and spicy tuna are excellent.  The Japanese Dynamite Salad was watery.  Overall an excellent lunch experience.
0,"I came in here with my service dog once and was publicly embarrassed when the manager came up to me and told me to wait outside. And no dogs were allowed. When I said he was a service dog and that he provides service for my PTSD she told me that law doesn't apply in Arizona. I didn't even know how to react. Under the American Disabilities Act (which is federal law) you are allowed to bring in a service dog to help with post traumatic stress disorder and employees are only allowed to ask if it is a service dog and what service it provides. My dog is trained, doesn't bark, doesn't pay attention to any people, and just sits by my side. I've never been kicked out of a restaurant or store before. They didn't even bring me my drink. I just sat outside and they left it inside where I was no longer able to go."
1,"After an excellent but unfilling dinner at Jaleo down the hall, my family wandered over to the secret pizza place. My dad had gotten a slice before our dinner and we knew that we would be in for more. After walking down a hall of records, I came across a white tiled pizza shop with no name.... yes, no name. After walking up to the counter I read the small menu on the wall, and all of a sudden, a worker with a heavy brooklyn accent asked what i wanted. I ordered a slice of sausage pizza, by looking at it i knew it would be good. I was rung up for a total of 5 dollars for a nice sized slice, after we just spent 225 for 4 at jaleo. This pizza was so simple but so tasty. Crispy thin foldable crust, hearty sauce, and authentic sausage. This is one of those stupid pizzas that everyone tells you about that taste so simple but so good. All together this place was great. After  i wolfed down the slice, i asked the lady at the register what the name is. She replied, \"" we don't have one, on yelp we're known as secret pizza\"". This made it that much better. Everytime im in vegas, i'll know to go here when i don't feel like burning money and i want a great pizza."
0,"The food isn't horrible, but it's pretty underwhelming compared to the other options for Spanish fare in this town. The prices are also a tad out of whack. For example, the Chorizo / Filet stuffed Mushrooms are a \""medium plate\"" and cost $9.00, but what you get are three mushrooms smaller than a golf ball. I don't know how the waitress dropped it on the table with a straight face. \n\nThe service was polite, but definitely slow paced. (This, in and of itself, isn't a bad thing --just something you should know before coming in.)"
1,"I dined at Bourbon Steak recently and was really impressed. I have been to many of the valley's fine steakhouses and loved the casual atmosphere (unlike the stuffy Capital Grille). Everyone from the hostess to the manager seemed thrilled we could join them for dinner.  The amuse bouche fries were very pleasant and I couldn't stop myself from picking before the appetizers came out.  I enjoyed the Hamachi Sashimi which was nice and light and a little fun, but not exactly amazing.  My husband had the steak which was wonderful and I had the fried chicken.  This fried chicken was awesome, wonderful flavor,and a no-bone chicken breast atop mac and cheese with a wonderful onion jus that really balanced the dish and made it pop.  For dessert my husband almost licked the bowl of the butterscotch pudding while really enjoyed my super thick and creamy chocolate custard. Then as the check arrived a nice little bag of caramel popcorn was dropped off to take home. How nice! Everything was wonderful except for the waiting. This is the one downside to Bourbon Steak, and what kept it from being 5 stars. A coke would sometimes take 10 minutes and dessert took 15. Always presented with a smile and apology for the wait...but still a shame.  I would totally recommend, just understand it may take a little longer than expected."
0,"For anyone who gives this place five stars-I seriously question your taste buds.  This is the Hometown Buffet of mexican food and it left both my friend and I feeling extremely ill.  If you want to spend a lot of money for canned food, then Valle Luna is perfect for you."
0,Vary Poor customer Service from the front door to the Bartenders. The Worst of them Was the So Called Manager. they really all should take Customer Service 101 Training I Would Definitely Not Recommend Any One to Go There. Manager Should go Have His 200.00 Walmart Suit Pressed Out.
1,"This was the perfect end to a tiring day in Las Vegas - good beer, tasty food, and fun atmosphere. \nWe had to wait by the bar for about 30 minutes before getting a table, but it was fine with us to have a drink and take time to read over the rest of the beer and food menus. They are pretty extensive, so if you can't find something that strikes your fancy, you may need to broaden your horizons a bit...\n A few people have complained in reviews about the loud music - we sat in a booth by the bar and had no problem with volume. The place was jam-packed. To me, that just says that its a popular place and people would want to be there. I've risked it with other restaurants that looked good on the outside, but my first clue should have been all the empty tables. This isn't the case with PUB - let the always-crowded dining room speak for itself!\nI had the prime rib sliders and oh, wow were they delicious. My husband did one of th DIY sandwich options on the menu - he had just finished the Las Vegas Half marathon, and the amounts of food and beer we got were just what he needed. Sure, the prices are higher than what you might pay at a pub in another city, but for Las Vegas, it was fantastic. If you're looking for a low-key, not too stuffy place to have some good food, good service, and good beer, this is it."
1,"Came here on a Friday night for Jesse's birthday.  It's right up the street from our humble abode, which adds the awesome cuz we're definitely coming back.\n\nBefore embarking on our quest, I browsed the Gasper's site and found that I could make an online reservation.  So I did.  Not that we really needed it, we were chomping early so the place wasn't anywhere near capacity.  Upon walking in I scoped the interior and found it to be tres bitchin.  Mood lighting and cool wall things and other things as well which were cool, I gotta say someone put their big boy decorating pants on.\n\nAt first I thought our server was a miserable bitchy Buzz Killington, but she turned out to be very awesome, just rough around the edges.  We immediately ordered the bruschetta, which was prepared fresh so it took some time.  This we made do with, even though I was foaming at the mouth.  The wait was worth it, as the bruschetta  was awesome.  So were our entrees.  I had the salmon and Jesse ordered her trusty chicken parm.  At one point, one of the other servers faked like he was going to topple our tough old broad server's tray.  Her eyes flashed and she almost came unhinged on the poor flamboyant fellow.  Easily the highlight of my night.\n\nJesse's highlight was the pumpkin cheesecake, delivered on-the-house by the owner since it was our first time there.  All in all, this place rocks.  Check it out post-haste."
1,"****Review of the Casino Only!****\n\nMy friends and I had the most wicked fun time gambling at this place.  I can't imagine a better group of people I would rather lose my money to!  We played craps and blackjack mostly so the drinks were free flowing.  Darina, our cocktail waitress, was so sweet!  Marie, our blackjack dealer in the Champagne Pit, had us singing and high-five'ing everyone at our table.  The craps dudes were all fun, gave good advice and were all around fun (well, except Glen...he was a bit of a hardass.)  I really had an awesome time here.  I won't be staying at the hotel anytime soon after reading the other yelp reviews tho I highly recommend going to throw your money down at the casino."
1,"A beautiful beautiful hotel, with the same room layout like the Palms, and a little bit easier to get in and out of with valet, no casino, etc.  The staff are all gorgeous and very very helpful.  The rooms are high tech and very sophisticated in design. \n\nIt would be great to have more choices than one relatively small restaurant, and a tiny bar (Rojo) in the room, and it's a long walk via something they call the \""Sky Tube\"", (which is, it should be noted, neither in the sky nor a tube) to the Palms, where the action is at.  The jacuzzi tub and rain from the sky shower is great. \n\nEnjoyed this stay quite a bit."
0,"The location is easy to find however the food leaves a lot to be desired. Mac and cheese although very appealing to the eye and cheesy, taste is quite bland. The greens taste like canned Glory greens with a hint of vinegar. And most importantly  the prices charged differ from those listed on their website. Although the price discrepancy was brought to the attention of the owners, we were still charged $6 more than the advertised prices. Not good business practice, kinda gave me the feeling of the old bait and switch. Overall will most likely not return."
1,"For $20, I got a large pad thai, 5 BBq pork skewers, three chive dumplings, tea leaf salad, 2 roti with sweet milk and a quart size bag of kumquats. Well worth the money! Next one is on June 23rd, it's gonna be hot so I'm gonna try to get there early!  There were a lot of things I didn't get to try ( fish cakes, beef noodle soup, papaya salad etc).\n\nIt starts at 9:00 am and ends at 12:30 pm so get there early if you want to get a table to eat at.  I live close by so taking food home was fine.  Overall, people were really nice and I would definitely go back next month!"
0,"This was the first restaurant me and my wife came to upon moving to Charlotte, and we had good food and a great time.\n \nRecently we returned expecting more of the same, but that is not at all what we got. At some point they totally changed up the menu from fine dining to more of a overpriced tapas mess.\n\nThey still listed a few entrees, so I ordered scallops from the entree menu. The restaurant was not busy but our food took a half hour to come out, our waiter was trying and came over to tell us he had checked on the food and it would be out soon.\n\nWhen the food finally came, there were exactly 2 scallops on the plate and the meal was $27.\n\nSeriously, $27 for 2 scallops and they took a half an hour.\n\nSilly."
0,"We ate here because we had free money on our players' cards and we didn't feel like driving anywhere.\n\nPros:  The onion rings were fried well and not too oily or burnt.  The tuna melt was just ordinary.\n\nCons:  The Monte Cristo was small, mushy and not put together well.  The potato salad was extremely runny and started to smell a little sour.  The chopped fruit that came in a cup with the Monte Cristo had frost on top of it and some of the pieces were frozen in the middle."
0,"I was not impressed but was shocked by the prices. RIDICULOUS!  I guess they assume you have extra money to throw around since you're in LV. Anyhow, loved the lobster tails besides the excessive amount of filling. The cannolis where not great. The lb of cookies was 16.95. I think. Cupcakes 3.50 ea. I didnt not expect to pay so much for pastries.  \n\n To top it off we stood in a LONG ASS line to order and when i was called to pay and pick up i was told my order of cannolis was taken. Wtf! How does that happen?  Its called shitty customer service and a waste of time.  I saw a pregnant lady leave upset. I would be too, if i was pregnant with a craving!  \n\nSeriously, avoid this place unless you wany to give it a try. You were warned. I will try to post up picture of receipt."
0,"I'm rooting for this neighborhood restaurant, but they really need to work on their customer service. The atmosphere is great, very cute and so far, after 3 visits, I can only say the food is just okay.  I would and want to continue to come back, but their service is NOT good. They really need to work on improving. C'mon, step it up! We want you to stay in business!!"
0,This is a review of the male dance review\nA girlfriend and I went to this club on a Sunday night. The strippers were mostly amatuers and they all danced like girls. We called Palomino and they picked us up from OG and we ended up having a great night!! But you know different strokes for different folks!! I'll pass on OG.

1,"I only went in to buy a few fish the other day, but the two ladies who were working in the aquarium area were so helpful its my new favorite fish place. They explained what fish would be best for my biTube, introduced me to a nice snail to clean my tank, and overall just made the experience very nice, quick and satisfying. I'll be going back for sure.\n\nBased on the other reviews, not sure I'd ever bring my dogs in there, and if they do actually sell dogs and cats that's very bad mojo. However, for fish, its a-ok."
0,Customer service was just kind of bleh and the burritos were just kind of bleh. The kind of food where everything tastes the same. Bleh
1,"This place gets five stars for the customer service alone! They are always on point, happy and friendly. The service is quick and the espresso beverages are quite delicious. Try the Iced Cocomo.. Add an extra shot!"
1,"Delicious food, knowledgeable staff, and a modern-chic setting. I loved the Vogue Martini and my husband enjoyed his Vogue Manhattan. The Vogue Burger was nothing short of perfection. It was prepared just as I ordered it and had a well-balanced flavor. The sweet potato fries with maple dipping sauce were a perfect pairing. We moved to the area this past spring and love living here even more now that we have a restaurant like Vogue Bistro on our block. It's perfect for a date night or even a night out with good friends!"
1,"This old restaurant is still alive and kicking. You want a big and filling meal for your money's worth, go here! Every time I go to Vegas I stop by here at least once during my trip. This restaurant is open 24 hours and has great food. They also have a lounge in the back which is good size, nice fire pit in the middle of a small water fountain, some pretty hostesses, and decent price drinks. The menu is your typical American food you can find at Dennys, Norms, Spires, etc. But the quality at Peppermill far surpasses those places. I would recommend this place to everyone going to Vegas!"
1,"My admiration for Public House started as my colleagues and I enjoyed our first round of drinks and an incredible meal here upon arriving to Las Vegas. Among many other things, the menu was refreshingly unique compared to the other options that skirt the strip and casinos, but then, the food was delivered by a personable server with some noteworthy and rare selections of wine & beer...the meal was SO good and the drinks made a perfect pair,\n\nBut wait...there's more. The next night we decided to take our clients here for drinks after our dinner meeting - we had about 40 in our party and the service, let alone the drinks and atmosphere were onpoint. The manager's and servers ensured everyone was taken care of and our client feedback was truly spectacular - sure, they were in good company but that was just icing on the cake in comparison to the incredible drinks, service, and atmosphere Public House provided.\n\nWe will be back!"
0,"My husband and I had a chicken sandwich with fries and coleslaw.  The chicken had no flavor, bun was soggy and lots of fat in our chicken.  We did not like the coleslaw.  Fries were good.  Our hotdog was mediocre at best.  Food is below average for price you pay.  2 chicken sandwiches your way single, 1 fries, 1 coleslaw and a chili cheese hotdog was $19.43.  I am never impressed with the folks taking my order either.  We are done.  We won't go back."
0,"I've heard some good things about this place, but not sure what all the hype is about. I went here for lunch today & got the special - spaghetti with corn & green beans on the side. The spaghetti was mediocre at best, very bland & unexciting with watery meat sauce (I think I could make it better and I've never made it) The sides were canned (not always an issue) but they were flavorless. Whoever posted about this place having fresh food is lying. I guess the atmosphere is attractive to some but I'm not a fan of restaurants that don't dust or clean. Sanitation rating 90.5 - not impressive. The place was packed, I guess this is the cool spot where all the \""hip\"" people come. I just want good, quality food & to even begin to call this \""Southern\"" food is a disgrace to my culture. My friend got the Southern chili & said it was the consistency of a Hormel chili, not great, not horrible. The cornbread he got was hard as a rock and was left uneaten after the first bite on the plate. The service was friendly & quick, that's about the only positive I experienced. I won't be rushing back to Lupies but since it is down the street from me I may try it again & see if it can get more than a 2 star rating. Keep in mind, I'm not a food snob but I know good food when I eat it & this was far from good..."
0,My first visit I waited 20 minutes in the drive tru only 4 cars ahead of me. Food was what I was expecting charbroiled burger that you can get in any corner in california. The food gets a 3.5 stars. Bacon avocado burger was good. Fries were OK. Pepsi fountain drink.\n\n2nd visit after 4 minutes in the drive tru Window without a Hello or please wait... I reversed out. I called the manager and let him know why he was getting 2 stars. He mentioned making everything from scratch takes time and the crew is all new locals who obviously don't have drive tru experience. I don't mind waiting for good food. In fact I went to in n out which is down the street. 6 cars in front of me.. 9 minute wait. \nI might give this place a try again..but with so many options in the area... it's not going to be soon.
1,"This place is awesome! The employees are friendly, the place is always clean and well stocked.  Even if there's a line out the door, you'll be in and out pretty quickly.  Oh, and their flavors and toppings are pretty delicious too."
0,"So disappointed... Every yelp search for 24 hour food totally sent me towards the Earl, and when I needed them the absolute most (right now)... They are currently closed. :( sadness doesn't even describe what my tummy feels like. My wife is so pissed that she actually told me to write this or sleep on the floor. She is the best thing to ever happen to me. The Earl gets 1 damn star because the lady told me very frankly that they can close at any time and do not have to stay open for any reason. Alas, we are starving and relegated to room service at $20/person for sub par food."
1,"I had been dreaming of this bagel palace ever since seeing it on the travel channel. Bagels coming out of a wood fired oven, WTF. I couldn't wait to taste them. So off to St-Viateur the oldest bagel shop in Montreal. As you walk in you see the assembly line of bagels going to their wood fired death. But they don't come out all burnt, instead perfectly toasted to a crisp outer deliciousness. Well I ordered a half dozen mixed and preceded to devour them one by one. So much for being off carbs. \n\nThere dough was light and fluffy inside with a crisp crusty outer shell. It was one fine bagel. No disappointment here, just satisfaction."
0,"The actual maids that came to my house were very punctual efficient and hard working. However, the other aspects of the service were very terrible. The main office that you call is hard to deal with and don't answer the phone. The main reason we called the service is to get the landscaping maintenance too. The guy came when I was not home, trimmed three out of the seven bushes in my yard and left without blowing out his mess. We called the office after finally getting in touch they said they would send him back and he did come back and blew bush pieces everywhere and still didn't trim the other bushes and asked us if we wanted to pay for another service.  We will never use this service again!!!"
1,"I came to this office before reading any reviews or researching it. I really lucked out with my experience! Upon arrival, Aimee gave me a full tour of the office. As small as that may sound, it made me feel like a valued patient already! It was very thoughtful of her to not whisk me into some room, but rather show me which rooms were for what purposes. After that, she went over a full review of injuries, pains and problems I have been having. I then met with Dr. Scharf, and he was so nice! Very easy-going and friendly! And he genuinely seems to love what he does! I plan to keep returning for treatments!"
1,"Its as good if not better than what every one says it is, We will definitely be back when in the area."
0,"Bland food just like every other Mexican place I've tried here. Nice place, great service."
0,"I did hear lots of goods things about Noca especially if you want to go and have fish.  But after my Sunday experience I would not recommend Noca at all, especially not on Sunday when they do have their Sunday Supper, where you can only choose from 2-3 dishes and they charge you flat $35. For their defense, they do give you three corse meal, but when I go out I would like to eat what I want and not what you decide to serve me.  You do have an option to upgrade to something better but thats additional $10-$20.  Now do you get good quality and good food for that much money?  Yes, you do and at the same time you don't.  It is about quality of food and experience and not how many plates can you throw in front of me. One of the choices was fry chicken with mash-potato (yes that is on the list), I think you can go to KFC and get better chicken and potato. I did have fish and I must say It was great but when you sum everything up it's not worth it at all. Place is small, looks modern, low light, but due to their service it looks more like fancy burger joint than upscale or romantic place.  \n\nAt the end of the night I did have some questions about my bill but manager (Elliot) was not helpful at all; and no I was not asking for free stuff.  I did manage restaurant for several years and as manager you should be about customer service because when someone is coming to your place for first time (as he was told) make that extra step and have a customer who is going to come back, especially today when restaurants are disappearing overnight.   I may have given them different review if went there on a different day than Sunday and had better customer service but overall it's not worth your time or money.  Its sad, fish was very good :(.\n\n________________________________________\nResponding to the Restaurant: \nActually when I did make reservation I did ask if I could use my Groupon on Sunday and I was told I could.  So that is the reason I did decided to come to the restaurant on Sunday and not any other day.    People do not go out with the plan to ask for something to be waived or anything like that, especially if they are aware it's stated otherwise.  When I gave my Groupon to the server I was told I could not use it, I did not ask for the manager or for server to take anything of my bill.  I guess server did call for the manager and once manager did show up it stated I can't use it, which I was aware at that time.  Again I was not complaining about my bill, my question was about service, I was told I could use my Groupon on Sunday which was mistake of the restaurant. Its restaurant customer service 101."
1,"Excellent food, thanks to yelp for finding this.  BTW, please follow everyone's recommendations before ordering.  The salt-roasted beets and beef filet flatbread were recommended, we tried them and were impressed.  We ventured on our own and ordered the shrimp with fingerling potatoes and it was over-powered with vinegar, so it was just marginal."
0,"What a disappointment! This place is plagued by inconsistent food and servce. My family and I have dined here a half dozen times since it opened and have had mixed results. When it's good it's really good, but if you can't be consistent then what can you be? We ate there for dinner last night. The guy behind the counter put us on hold while he made some shakes. He was also the one to deliver our food. Since we had dined there several times before, we knew that the onion straws and the fried pickles came with sauces. There were no sauces served so we asked him for the accompanying sauces. He looked a little frazzled and said he would be right back with them. My wife took a nibble at my daughters fries and they were cold. Not even warm but cold. The server returned with only the onion straw sauce. We reminded him that we wanted the fried pickle sauce also and let him know that my daughter's fries were cold. He tried to make light of the situation and said how cold fries were no good. He left to go get the sauce and some hot fries we assumed. As we dug into our burgers, we noticed that the onion straws were not their usual crispy, hot selves. These were luke warm, oily and limp. The plan was to let the server know this when he returned with the fried pickle sauce and the hot fries. He never returned. Sure, we saw him floating around the restaurant which wasn't busy. Poor service & inconsistent food are never a good combination. The thing that really sucked is that my wife and daughter were so looking foward to having dinner there and they left disappointed."
0,"Hmmmm I thought reviews couldn't be taken down. Avoid this place like the plague management is a bunch of morons , you constantly walk in on drug deals happening in the stairwells, groups of guys on the sidewalks blatantly smoking dope and even though It takes me 3-4 mins to walk to the front office it took mgmt 52 mins to get here with the golf cart. Girlfriend came over and said guy was out front with his hands down his shorts and sure enough I look out and he is going to town and again when mgmt finally showed up 45 mins later he was gone. The noise is unbearable ppl in stairwells screaming at all hours loud music people arguing about smoking dope and mgmt refuses to do anything about it saying it's a police matter but when you call the cops they tell you if they can't hear it from the outside theirs nothing they can do . They will keep raising your rent but get nothing in return! Stay away from this place!!!"
0,Beyond disappointing....Wannabe Heaven...Overpriced ... Bunch of kids running the place... I wonder what it will be called next year after this one fails....

Not Calling Him Back!  Rip Off"
1,On my visit to Edinburgh. This place was the perfect spot to start the day with a delicious breakfast. The eggs were cooked and scrambled to perfection and the bacon was crisped just right. Help yourself to some delicious pastries.The coffee is smooth and not at all bitter (no sugar required). And free wifi that is actually quick and useable. (For those gluten free hippies ;) out there it's all here for ya too!) \n\nLots of people here meeting friends on the couches or doing there course work on laptop.
0,"I have purchased two bikes here.  The products are great but the service isn't.  The bike mechanics are generally not very knowledgeable, and the head  mechanic never actually listens to what you have to say.\n\nI had my bike serviced under warranty.  I was promised a turnaround time of 3 to 4 weeks but instead had to wait 3 months.  When I received the bike back it was delivered with flat tires, and improperly adjusted brakes and gears making it un-ride-able.  Under further inspection there were various bolts and washers missing, and the crank spindle was installed without grease when it should have been.\n\nFurther I was assured by the store's owner that everything that it went in for was fixed, however only a portion of the tings were fixed."
1,"Frank... It's not a bar if there is no poker machines... (The Dive Bar excluded.\n\nBarcelona is a great hidden spot in Vegas. It's relaxed, and the sangria is great. Once in after a couple times, the staff knows you by name, and  the food is nothing but amazing. It's great to have such quality in the neighborhood."
0,"Not the best, but good enough when you're craving some filipino food and dont want to go too far."
0,"I hate to review this place like a normal pet store when they are really just a low-budget dog groomer but if you are going to sell food, toys, and clothes too, you should really do it right.  \n\nOh Smelly Dog.  For years I have driven by you and thought \""Hmph, I wonder what that place is like\"" as I head over to my favorite dog wash down the street (Wag N Wash) or to my favorite dog accessory store up Camelback (Oliver & Annie).  Since O&A closed and the owner told us he was sending his supplies over to Smelly Dog, we figured we HAD to try it.\n\nWe walk in and the place is a disaster.  Dog baths just out in the middle of the store with little yippie dogs all tied up near the door.  The floor was wet with pools of water which made it very slippery and dangerous.  The food selection is slim...like you have two choices.  I like that one of them is local but they could stand to carry a few others.  Their toy selection is okay but they could stand to carry WestPaw too.  They dog-clothing is pretty much limited to small dog stuff which is also too bad.\n\nThe one girl who worked there was pretty enthusiastic and helpful but the checkout girl completely pissed me off when she allowed a wash customer to cut in front of me to pay after I had stood there for 5 minutes.\n\nThis place has too many shortcomings to replace the wonderful Wag N Wash.  I'll be going to Noble Beast for accessories now.  Sorry...Smelly Dog is just too chaotic for me."
1,"After seeing the insane lines and the lame-ass food options the UNLV student union, I decided forgo and head for Stephano's. And I'm glad I did. My only regret is not coming sooner! Stephano's offers excellent quality food at reasonable prices. The decor is inviting, clean, and comfortable. The workers are totally friendly and ask if you have a UNLV ID for a free drink. (Good looking out fellas!) My roasted chicken and chicken kebabs (on different occasions) were flavorful and juicy. My meal came with a delicious Israeli salad, hummus, rice and pita bread. Also, they offer this garlic sauce that is amazing. They have a large selection of beers, if you decide you want some alcohol. The joint is across from UNLV and I plan on coming here at least once a week."
0,Went by reviews on Yelp and this place was not good at all.  The lunch special had no different price and two of the buffet table were empty!  Food was bland and not much variety!  Try something else before going here.
0,"I've been here about 4 times and the last was what made me decide never to come back. I will say, the rolls are great. They have  a lot to choose from. However if your expecting it to come fast, think again. The service is very slow here and not friendly. They take forever to come take your order and don't visit your table very often, so when I ordered from here I would try to get most things I wanted in one visit. However that's not even good enough, like I said before, the food comes out very slow. I have no clue why. Last time I ordered sashimi and some rolls. All my rolls came first and then sashimi last. What's the point in the sashimi if I cant even get that first? Anyway I was here with a friend trying to enjoy the night when I noticed a few people down the table/booth seating quickly get up and whimper. Sure enough I look down  at my seat and there's a cockroach crawling right towards my leg. I got up quickly and started to lightly laugh, even though I was less than pleased. I didn't want to cause more of a scene since the other people were furious. They left without paying. The waitress explained to us that it never happens, and they sprayed that morning. Well if have to spray for bugs.. you must have a problem with it? Anyway, we finished our sushi, and no discount was offered for the inconvenience. Needless to say, I wont be returning."
1,"tasty appetizers, lots of beer, sports on tv, who could ask for more."
0,"The pancakes were decent.\n\nThe rest of my breakfast plate was inedible.  Poached eggs with uncooked yolk centers that probably would have made me sick had I dared to try them.  Tiny, shriveled, dry bacon slices.  The \""fruit plate\"" was laughable - 4 small slices of unripe melon with the rinds still on.  Yuck, yuck, and double yuck.\n\nYou're on vacataion - do yourself a favor and spend a couple extra bucks on breakfast somewhere else that won't make you sick."
0,"Have you ever eaten Chinese food?  Real chinese food?  Trust me, it's not like this--this is decadent, greasy, rich American food with Chinese names.\n\nMa Po Tofu is not supposed to be crunchy outside, soft inside, and sweet/sour.  But here it is!\n\nAlso, don't ever order a coctail or drink not on their menu.  I got an unlayered B-52 in a brandy glass.  More like a Yak-2."
0,"It's the worst Thai Express. Very bad customer service. I told the girl I wanted my meal to be spicy (she is supposed to ask me but she didn't so I said it myself). After I didn't see her put it on the bill, I asked her: it will be spicy right? She said yes. And guess what? Not only it wasn't spicy at all, but the pad sew was so dry. I took a take out so I couldn't waste more time to go back. She charged extra when I asked for a bowl instead of the usual tight box when the other Thai Express don't do that. Not only I didn't get something worthy of the money I was paying, the cashier was just busy chattering with her colleagues and didn't pay attention to giving the right service."
1,Great atmosphere and the food was good! Will definitely return!!\\
0,"Went to this restaurant with a party of 12, this place just couldn't Handel it. Poor service, wait time for food was 50 minutes.then when the food was brought to the table 4 orders were wrong and some Cold, manager said she could do nothing to make it right, Mario your places need a lot of help, won't be back( ever )"
0,"I have no idea how this place has 4 stars.   Afterwards, we were practically offended that it cost us over $100 to eat here. \nThe only plus this place has is that the customer service was great.\nThe selection is decent, but for that amount of money, we expected more.  They serve small servings so you can try a lot of different things.  \nThe carving station has sausages, prime rib, and regular ribs.  My husband said the sausage and prime rib were very dry.  The ribs were so tough that even using his teeth, he couldn't pull off the meat.  \nPaella - bland and dry\nLamb Curry -  The taste was off.  Almost like it had gone bad.\nFried chicken - Average taste, but dry\nSushi - didn't taste fresh, was dry\nShepherds Pie - no seasoning at all. It was bland mush in your mouth.\nYou get the idea. Dish after dish, we could only take one bite.  We were so disgusted we decided to not try any more and just try out the dessert bar.  Other than the gelato, it was no better than you would get in any Chinese buffet.  We were so very, very disappointed."
0,"1st time was great service. Husband of the owner was super nice and the experienced barista was sweet as well. Prices were pretty outrageous for a place you walk up and order from but the great service and food brought us back.\n\n2nd time the service was poor. The lady seemed to be hating life and didn't offer a single smile or pleasantry. I paid 14 bucks for a plate of chicken, rice, veggies and a pita which I wouldn't mind if it were a sit-down-and-get-served restaurant but you walk up and order and then they call your name (or bring it to you if they aren't too busy). \n\nBottom line: Good food and nice atmosphere but won't be back due to prices and unfriendly service. I would be willing to return if my plate were 8 bucks instead of 14."
0,Very dirty!!!!\n\nAs soon as you walk in to this place you are hit with a terrible smell. You can tell that it is older so there is only so much that can be done. The laser tag itself was pretty decent but everything else wasnt great. The arcade is small and the food is terrible. Bathrooms were clean enough for me to use but all around not an impressive place.
1,Love their burgers & fries\nPeriod ... !!!!!!
0,"Been here twice now, both times the resturant was completely empty. The staff made a good effort, but alas they were unprofessional. The food was slightly less than mediocre, but it was prepared and served pretty quick. If you're looking for authentic and delectable Asian cuisine, this is not the place. But, if you're in the area and need a quick, reasonably priced meal with large portions Wai Wai is your gem."
1,The decor is modern yet warm and inviting.  The house margaritas are made well.  They offer a variety of great tequila and the food has been excellent on both of my visits.  The bar staff was knowledgable and fun.  What more could you want from a tequila bar.
1,"One of my favorite meals is a good steak and a potato, and I must say, I have never been disappointed coming to the Texas Roadhouse. I love the peanuts at the table. I start eating some of those right away. Iced tea is good and they keep it filled up for me. I've never had a bad waitress here. They wear really skippy short shorts here, which doesn't bother me, just an observation. I imagine that for the guys to get the good tips? The rolls are pretty good, but I wait till the end to eat one due to the honey butter that comes with it. I don't like my sweet at the beginning, only at the end. :) I order my steak medium, and it came out flavorful and juicy. I eat the whole potato, skin and all, its so good. I have met the creepy balloon guy. He's just an old man trying to make a living, cut the guy a break. I just politely said no, I would not like a balloon and he went away. Pricewise, under $20 for lunch, which for a steak restaurant, not a bad deal. If you want that nice feeling of fullness after eating a good meal, I highly recommend this restaurant."
0,"While visiting this place for our first time, my husband and I were looking it up on yelp. While alot of the reviews were not good, we wanted to give it a chance. The service was extremely slow on a not so busy day and the food is tasteless and mine was lukewarm.  We gave it a try but won't be back."
0,Awful. I'm embarrassed for the performers and TI who call this a show.
0,Food was excellent! Service at the bar by Kim H was terrible. We saw our kale salad sit in the window for about 5 minutes before it was brought out. Then patiently awaited our Uncle Louie's favorite pasta for another 10 minutes which sat in the window to get cold. It tasted great but could have been warmer. Would have been nice if she had checked on us and refilled my husbands beer he asked for. Not until the last 2 bites of pasta did she check to see how we were doing... Too late to have another beer with dinner and ask for another piece of bread. Then took forever to run our credit card. With 6 people at the bar she much have been overwhelmed!!! I'll be back to another restaurant for the food but not this location.
1,"Their Lunch Buffet is nice, their North Indian dishes are really really good...Good Ambience.. \n\nThe dosa is also nice but huge... Basic veggies like okra are just ok...but the paneer and cholle etc are really nice..."
1,"Zoom in... Zoom out...  If you need the pressure checked in your tires this is the best and fastest way to do it.  They have a lane dedicated to just checking your air and filling you up:)  Only problem, I forgot to have them check my spare.  Wish they would automatically do it since it is just hanging on the back door!!!"
1,"Confession: I went to Carolinas at 9 am this morning for a tostada. I say it was a good breakfast. Also, in the early morning the restaurant is actually quiet! It's almost nice. Anyways, I'm glad they are open earlier, but I still haven't tried any breakfast options there.\n\nCarolinas is not pretty. It was a chinese restaurant, which become clear as soon as you walk in the door and see the crazy colors and zodiac symbols. The kitchen is wide open and it's always packed with people, so it is very very noisy! \n\nHowever, if you are willing to brave the atmosphere, the food is darn good. I like the beans more than any of the meat products, so I stick to burritos and tostadas normally, but every once in a while a chimichanga is worth a try."
1,"Recommended by my husband's co-worker, and I am very happy with the suggestion!  My husband gets something different every time, but I always get the shrimp w/snow peas.  Love it!\n\nFriendly service, clean restaurant, large portions -- and it's fun to watch the chefs prepare the food.  We will go back again and again."
1,"My coworkers wished me good luck as I headed to my haircut at the wee hairdressers down the road.  I thanked them and said \""I've got long hair, so if it's not a good cut, it'll be hard to notice.\""\n\nI don't exactly know why we were all unsure.  A hairdressers that doesn't serve bad coffee/tea on arrival?  That isn't full of people in totally non-sensible shoes for being on their feet all day?  That doesn't make you feel like you're being churned through a production line, make you feel bad about your hair style/colour, and doesn't try to talk you into spending more money??  A hairdresser where the people have been cutting hair longer than I've been alive??  Hum, sounds strange to me...\n\nAnd it totally was strange, but in a good, quick, cheap, comedy craic kind of way.\n\nIt was a dry cut -I didn't book for a shampoo- and I was treated to a history of the Bruntsfield area, while my hairdresser worked.  He told me that my hair is in great condition and that I really only need it cut 2 or 3 times a year if I'm not changing the style.  Wait, what about every 6 weeks?  \""That's just what other hairdressers tell you to get your money.\""  Oh ho! What about the fact that they're all always telling me to colour my hair and cover my greys?  \""They WHAT?  Those aren't greys, they're fine white hairs that are easier to see because your hair is so dark.  If you start colouring your hair now you will never be able to stop and you will regret it!\""  \n\nAt the end of my cut he explained everything he did, how and why he deviated a bit from what we'd originally talked about and how he is \""a bad hairdresser\"" because he doesn't try to get people to spend more money on their hair than they need to.  \n\nI walked away 30 minutes later, amused, bemused, and only \u00a314 lighter.  Win."
1,love it.\n\ni wouldn't compare this to katz in new york. just different. and both places deserve to stand on their own.\n\ni suggest the to go line because the sit in line was just stupid.\n\nsandwich looks small when you take it out of the bag but basically becomes a meat bloom when unwrapped.\n\nmedium fat was just perfect.
1,"A local joint off of E Carson street.  My girlfriend lives near by so we go when we can.  Nothing fancy, just cheep drinks, good pizza, and a great staff.  A+"
1,"I love going to Yama Sushi. I found this place 2 years ago while living in Vegas for the summer. If you like all you can eat sushi, this is your place. Before my last visit this would have been 5 stars. Unfortunately after my last visit just for stars. My only real complaint is the speed of the food coming out. Sometimes it take longer than I feel it should. Might just be me. If you are eating all you can eat sushi you might realize that after 20 minutes that rice will explode in your stomach. Then that is all you can eat. I love this place and usually leave saying why do a stuff my stomach so much. Only to make a trip back the next time I am in town. The variety and the freshness of the sushi here is among the best. Get of the strip and get over to Yama Sushi. ."
0,"Brussel sprouts and sweet potato on my pizza? OK, Enough is enough. The crust is so-so and while I really wanted to like this place, it didn't rock me. We had the meatball pizza and it was OK. I would love to see a real NY or Chicago pizza restaurant in this town. The Wedge salad was good but I do not like dates with my blue cheese dressing thank-you. \n\nService was good and my friends liked the beer, large and varied selection. On to another pizza place."
0,"PLEASE dont waste your time or money going here! We got 2 nights king room for our 1 year anniversary (before going to a gifted timeshare) and im so glad I ddnt stay longer than 2 nights. 1st off our tub was DIRTY im talkin someones booger, hair and lotion on the wall of the freaking shower. The bed looked worn.   ( u shaped) and had a possible adjoining room so we heard our neighbors cussing out their kids and being loud in the am. Didnt mind all the black people, didnt feel \""unsafe\"" but the hallway smelt like weed strongly. And no ac in halls. Even for a good deal of less than $40 for both nights (groupon) I wouldnt go again. Pool is pitiful thats y they dont even mention they have one. Not kidding. Hot tub size pretty much. Didnt use it. Just overall not a great experience at all. Bowling alley sucks. Movie theatre is average. Bleh. Thats about it. Will NEVER EVER come again. \n\n They also sent me an email saying I had a reservation for the day I checked out,  to come check back in for 1 night so I had to call once I had already left. Waited on phone 10 minutes only to be told they had no record of a reservation and that my card wouldnt be charged again. Bars are closed or stink...seriously"
0,They changed the style and taste after while I liked the taste when they just opened.
1,"Studio B at the M is hands down the best buffet in town! They have a wide array of food selections that will surely please everyone including picky eaters - there's something for everyone. American, Asian, Italian, Soul food...you name it and they'll pretty much have it. It's quantity that doesn't sacrifice quality. Steaks aren't sitting under warming lamps for hours until they get dry and rubbery. Sushi runs out fast so they whip up a new batch every 5 minutes. The variety is pleasantly overwhelming - you'll almost feel encouraged to try every single thing you see (which I've done) even food you won't normally eat.\n\nThe line gets extremely long so you have to get here at an odd time. Otherwise, you'll be standing in line for hours and I'm not kidding!"
0,"I would give zero stars but I am not sure it would post.\nIf you like freezing cold food with warm ice tea , you have found it! Horrible service, we were greeted with a bowl of broken store bought chips and weak salsa, that was the high point! The waiter forgot to enter our order, when the food finally came it was ice cold. The manager picked up the tab, I prefer to have a good meal and pay. This Was torture. The staff is clueless. Sam fox has jumped the shark."
0,"I came all the way from Columbus craving a Caribbean Passion smoothie. My excitement dwindled away with every minute I had to wait for my smoothie. Between one of the employees not knowing what to do without fresh orange juice (don't you just default to whatever orange juice they have) and the upset looks from all the other people who had been waiting for who knows how long... it ruined my experience. 18 minutes is way more than what I should have to wait for a smoothie. On the upside, it was tasty (only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1)."

0,"You'd think a place called Hot Dog Stop would serve a great Chicago-Style hot dog.\n\nYou'd also think they'd have snappy Sabrett hot dogs, since hey, they have 4 Sabrett umbrellas outside.\n\nLeave your assumptions at the door, since neither of the above is true.  My Chicago Dog was the following:  A skinless hot dog, inside a mexican-style bolillo roll, with chopped tomato, jalapenos, sport peppers, electric green relish, mustard, onions, and a pickle spear on the side.  \n\nC'mon guys, at least try to make it look like the real thing.  Give me a poppy seed roll, put the pickle on the dog, give me a natural casing dog, no jalapenos.  Sliced tomato please.  Sport pepper and relish were fine.  \n\nThe owner(?) was energetic, almost slightly offensive.  Tone it down slightly dude.  Customers are uncomfortable when you comment on their perceived hunger based on your judging their body size - even guys.      \n\nThe condiment bar was well stocked, but canned mushrooms?  Yuck.  \n\nAlso very expensive for what you're getting.  I paid $10 for a dog, fries and a drink.  On a positive note, their fries were really good, albeit a little too salty, but really hot and crunchy.\n\nI hope they can get it together, and other hot dogs looked good."
0,"Oh my! This is the smallest Supercentre I have ever seen. The men's clothing is three very short aisles, maybe five metres long. It's like they tried to see if they could put everything in a third of the normal space. Many of the products were only stocked in the smallest of sizes. Maybe this should be labelled as Walmart Urban Supercentre. It's smaller than a regular Walmart and yet they took up a third of the space with groceries. And they really don't understand Quebec... no bakery, no gourmet cheese, no butcher. We left and went to the store on Jean-Talon, so we could actually find products on the shelves."
0,"Was here for a gala at the adjoining conference center.  Service was terrible. The waitress kept slamming food and drinks on the  table. She only brought dinner for half the table and the rest had to wait for 15 minutes. One of the guests had to wait about 20 minutes for the meal. Horrible!\nI've been to many Marriotts before and hold a frequent visitor card, but this one has been the worst experience so far.\n\nI know this isn't a review that completely reflects the hotel or any restaurants inside it, but the fact that this service was under the Marriott name prompted this review and rating"
0,"How does this restaurant have 3.5 stars? The food was mediocre at best. And there really was no service, so I can't even write anything about it. \n\nThe pakodas were downright pathetic, the navrattan korma was drowning in an unappetizing cream sauce, the naan came out of a freezer I'm sure, the saag was the worst I've ever had.\n\nThe dal was OK, but that's because it is almost impossible to screw up a dal. I did like the raita though.\n\nThe dessert was probably for diabetics. Honestly, if there wasn't a sign there that said it was kheer, I wouldn't have known. Seriously, it needed MUCH more sugar, some cardamom, saffron, nuts and needed to be made by someone who knows what kheer is.\n\nNow comes the funny part, they make you pay BEFORE you even sit down!! What is this? A restaurant or a school cafeteria? Our glasses were refilled only once and our dirty plates were never cleared. Needless to say, I did not leave a tip."
0,"On standby with nothing better to do but vent my frustrations about an airline that is completely incompetent!  \n\nTo start, my ticket did not have my TSA precheck on it (despite having called and spoken to the us airways rep on the phone the day prior).  My husband had his number, but not mine. So much for my efforts to call and make sure that was taking care of....doesnt help if only ONE of us has pre check. \n\nA journey from oakland to san antonio took nine hours because both of our flights were delayed.  I was accepting because the afternoon flights are not always timely. I forgave and forgot. \n\nHOWEVER....for our 8:45 flight, we woke up early to be on time.  It was still dark as we left our san antonio hotel (which, was awesome. Highly recommend the Mokara Hotel in San Antonio).  Again, my TSA precheck is not on my ticket but after 15 minutes of confusion, the us airways rep FINALLY enabled that.  Fast lane at security so i can go hurry and wait ar the gate. \n\nThen, waiting. And more waiting. For an 8:45 am flight, our odds were more promising. Not so. For some reason, the plane was not ready until 15 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave. Once boarded, another 45 minutes goes by with an announcement from the pilot that the bags were now on the flight. Really?  An hour after the flight was to leave, the first flight of the day, and the bags just got on?!  So that was why we were an hour late?\n\nSo i registered my concern to the stewardess that if our flight was an hour late, we would miss our connecting.  Not much she could do she said.  Finally, we landed and ran to our gate (mind you, we are with our six year old) and get there on the nose.  The gate agent said they closed the doors and we could not get on. Perfect. \n\nSo now my family is waiting another 3.5 hours to catch an alternate plane on standby. We should have been home now.  \n\nI have posted to my facebook that i am forever boycotting this airline. And guess what? my friends are commenting how they have had similar experiences and will never fly us airways!  \n\nI can only hope that we get in this flight, it is not delayed and are bags reach our destination. I may be back to edit this review...\n\nSo i am back to report that after arriving home (finally), we discovered that both of our pieces of luggage were wet inside and out. All clothes had to be washed or dry cleaned. Unbelievable."
1,Excellent food. Best Italian in Vegas. Highly recommend for breakfast and dinner. The price is so good you would think the food would be cheap but you would be mistaken. AM service was outstanding but the night crew could use some work. May have been an off night. Still worth the 5 stars.
0,"DO NOT RENT FROM PAYLESS CAR RENTAL at the Las Vegas Airport!!!  They are terrible!  This location will not let you rent a car from them unless you agree to their \""optional\"" $2.99/day roadside assistance plan.  They do not tell you this when you reserve online and do not include this fee when they are giving you a quote.  \n\nI booked the reservation on a last minute special I found before I boarded my plane for vegas and it was $10 cheaper than my reservation at Advantage Car Rental.  Luckily I didn't cancel my Advantage reservation as their unwillingness to let me rent without an extra $3/day tacked on would have made my car rental much more expensive.  Since \n\nI already have AAA, I thought the plan provided little value.  \nI went to the Advantage counter and they quickly got me set up in a car and I was off to enjoy my vacation.\n\nOn an added note, I found their practice of photo-copying your driver's license a little to risky for customers in this age of rampant ID theft..  Since I cancelled my rental at the counter, I made sure to get the copy the agent made of my license too."
1,"Great pizza. Had the one with pepperoni, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese topping. The goat cheese on the pepperoni made me happy. The crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside to leave me with a pleasant mouth feel."
1,"We have used Eli The Handyman for years and my apologies for not posting sooner.  Eli and his crew have been so helpful with every service call we have ever made.  Despite his busy schedule, he always continues to amaze in terms of timeliness, quality of work, efficiency, and price.  If you use Eli the Handyman you will get a courteous, high-quality and trusty handyman service and that's speaking from year's of experience and probably 30 house calls and emergencies over the years on several houses and properties.  Eli, Rudy and the entire team's  professionalism, reliability and quality is bar none the best we've ever seen.  We highly recommend you contact Eli for any services you need.....he can do it, and has proven time and time again to do it all.  Thanks Eli again for today's service call and every other one you've done for me, my family and friends.  You rock!"
1,"An absolute LIFESAVER!   SONNY THE MANAGER ON DUTY......A plus customer service!  I made the mistake of choosing the lowest cost offsite parking on the Howard Johnson property...MISTAKE!  I will be lucky if my car is there when I return.  The shuttle wasn't coming for another 25 minutes and I'm gonna miss my flight.  Im sure the HJ manager meant well but he tells me if I walk across the street and through a parking lot I can catch the train.....mistake #2.  I'm sweating my butt off fast walking now down 44th st with luggage.  The manager Sonny at preflight brings me an ice cold bottle of water and grabs one of his drivers and gets me to the airport......he says \""park with us next time\""  \nThank you Sonny and I absolutely will.  That was very very nice what you did."
1,"OH FEZ how I miss you! I have been to Fez numerous times and this review is long overdue. Their scrumptious and delectible dishes are down right amazing. The Fez benedict is my all time favorite, followed by the breakfast kirsa, panini, and french toast. But trust me everything on their menu is fantastic! During brunch they have $3 drinks which are all delicious. The Gspot is soooo good, a concauction of grapefruit vodka, ruby red grapfruit, and soda. I also love the belini as well which is quite refreshing.\n\nIn all this place is worth a visit whether you are near or far with their mouth watering dishes and gulpable drinks! You won't be disappointed and that's a promise!"
0,"If I could give negatives stars I would. If Planet Hollywood was on fire I wouldn't piss on it to put it out.. Let me explain.. I have probably stayed at around 5000 hotels in my lifetime and this was one of THE worst experience I have had.  After traveling all day to get there we went inside to check-in.  The line was probably 50 people deep at 6:00 PM.  At the rate it was moving it would have taken 2 hours to get a room.  We had tickets to Cirque Du Soleil \""O\"" so we had to check our bags at the bell desk and go to the show. We came back at 10:00 ish and the line was 40 deep so we went to dinner to waste time.  At about 11:00 we came back completely exhausted and had to wait in line. it was about 30-35 deep and took us an hour to get to the front. So at midnight I finally get a room.. I was pissed but there were other folks with babies and small children stuck in line... All the while they had 2 perky employees hardly busy for the VIP check-in, so instead of them helping out the normal backlog they stood relatively idle.. So, once I got to the front of the line I asked them \""how are you going to compensate me for standing in line for one hour - drink coupons, what?\"". The replay was.. NOTHING.. Fukking nothing for standing in line for one hour just to check in at midnight.. Also, the timeshare choads that they let prowl their halls are rude, unprofessional scumbags.. they insulted my girlfriend after she rightly refused their crappy deal and told her \""she didn't make enough to buy a timeshare\"".. Bottom line is that unless you are a stupid moron with a lot of time to waste and tons of cash to throw down the toilet.. don't bother staying there because you are not the type they like.."
0,"Oh Excalibur...your castle exterior is quite quirky but we didn't exactly get the royal treatment inside. \n\nCame here with a few girlfriends for a long weekend of bachelorette/birthday festivities. Since our bridal friend & family was already staying at this hotel, the rest of my girlfriends booked a room here as well (we split one room w/ 2 queen beds b/w us 4 girls). We ended up in Tower 1.\n\nThe perks: \n+ Large beds\n+ Plenty of towels & bedding upon request\n+ Decent pricing\n+ Strong AC\n\nThings to note:\n- No free wifi! Only an ethernet hookup (booooo)\n- Thin walls\n- No food amenities/vouchers with booking\n- Rather far from other destinations on The Strip\n- Not enough wall outlets\n- QUESTIONABLE CLEANING...found some sticky pieces of caramel popcorn between my sheets...gross!\n\nBottom line -- if you're on a budget, Excalibur can be an acceptable deal. But you must remember to factor in cab fares & driving through traffic if you want to check out other places on The Strip. There are limited amenities here, but this hotel may work out if you just need an affordable place to crash during your time in Vegas."
0,"I went through the drive through and ordered 1 burrito and chips and salsa. Got home and realized I didnt have my burrito. I didnt have enough time to go back and come back home again, so I got ready for work, and then went back on my way to work. It had now been about 45 minutes since I was at the drive-thru. I walked inside this time, and explained what had happened. The girl didnt' seem to care. She grabbed a burrito that had been sitting in the corner by the drive thru for this whole time apparently. I was hoping for a fresh burrito to take to work, not an old one that had been sitting out. She said they could charge me for a new burrito. I said no thank you I will just take my money back for the one I never got. She did give it back but dropped my money on the counter with a little attitute. I guess it was my fault they forgot to put my burrito in the bag? Went across the street to Carambas to pick up lunch instead. Love Carambas!"
1,Good food. Reasonable prices. Good portions.\n\nFriendly service.
0,"I use to like Ulta. At least, I think I did. I often went to the Ulta at MetroCenter before it closed, and when it did, I had no choice but to start visiting this Ulta. If it were not for the specific makeup I needed I wouldn't bother coming here. The customer service is non-existent. These so-called makeup artists or whatever they are, shouldn't even exist. To this day, not one of them has ever offered to help me when I go to the store. They stare at me when I walk by but continue chattering away to each other, or seek out the one blonde in the store. I walk in, pick up what I need and get the heck out of there. \n\nThe stuff is overpriced. You can get the drugstore brands of makeup for way cheaper anywhere else. The coupon thing is a joke. The points are a waste. Spend hundreds of dollars for a free hair brush?! Are you kidding?!"
0,"I would rate it 3 stars, but the service was horrible. My buddy and I went for pick-up and he had an Entertainment Book coupon which was a \""Buy one get one free.\"" The guy working the counter wouldn't honor the coupon. He kept saying that they were running a special that was a better deal than the coupon. A line starting forming and we just paid the full price to avoid the hassle. Granted, if you are expecting to pay full price, it may be worth it. If you have a coupon, don't even think about it."
0,"I ate here twice.  The first time, I had a steak dinner, and found they forgot to season the meat, forgot to season the spinach, forgot to bring me any bread (I get just a little and look forward to it), and FORGOT I WAS THERE.\n\nTwo days later, 20 people for breakfast, they were OK, but JUST OK."
0,Slowest drive thru and inside is just as bad! It's been bad for years. I don't understand why they can't get it together.
1,Very nice stay.  Amber at the front desk was extremely polite and helpful. All front desk staff were always smiling!\n\nRestaurant staff needs to smile more.
0,"OMG! The previous yelper echoed my sentiments about this place precisely.  I don't know how this place stays in business.  Hydrotherapy is already an uneasy process but this owner's grim attitude makes it even more uncomfortable.  I can overlook a bad attitude here and there because everyone is allowed to have at least one bad day but this one just makes you feel bad for even coming in.  When you walk in, there's no real greeting and even though she's by the front desk, she doesn't address you for a minute.  This makes for an awkward situation. I felt like I had walked into the wrong place at first.  \n\nAnyway, I ended up going there because it was a LivingSocial coupon deal and I had wanted to try the  process.  After one session I reluctantly made a second one, and I showed up for the second one only to pick up the comfort items I purchased from the first visit. I didn't want to give this woman my money. I walked away promising myself that the next time I see a too-good-to-pass-up deal on LivingSocial or Groupon, stop and get Yelp before purchase.\n\nIt has become apparent now that some businesses can only lure new customers from using online coupon deals because they can't keep people coming back for more. \n\nMy advice to this owner is that the whole cleansing method is already an awkward situation, why not go out your way to make the client feel good about being there.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPS: If you read the owner's response, keep in mind that my complaint is not about my appointment time.  I still showed up in enough time to have kept it or make a new one. It's about the ATTITUDE (edited on 7/28/12)."
0,"First off I noticed that the patio was huge, a large open space.  Kind of nice, but it doesn't look like they have done anything too spectacular with it.  The waiter was nice and friendly, but overall not a great server.  I didn't even get my drink until after a 20 minute wait and I had to ask for it again.  I ordered a bacon cheese burger, which was huge, but overall fell short of flavor.  The fries were kind of boring and soggy.  As I complained to my girlfriend about how many pickles were put on my burger (7-8), she pulls a pickle out of her eggs.  What the hell, lol.  Shortly after that, the waiter noticed that there were a ton of red peppers left on our friends plate.  I guess the kitchen didn't get her food right either, she asked for no peppers.  The waiter had taken the drinks off the bill, which was nice.  But he should have taken her meal off the bill.  I wasn't impressed with the food or service.  This place lacks consistency, according to all these reviews."
1,Kaori is awesome :)and the food looks amazing. The decor is simplistic and cute. You can invite friends and be accommodated extremely fast
0,"Went to dinner tonight and it was different  from every other experience I have ever had at Pig & Pickle. This was just upsetting. The server didn't have much time for our table and actually let us know that. The food was good as usual, but the service ruined my night. I'm disappointed. Worst birthday dinner ever."
0,"Decided to give Frank & Lupe's another shot since we were heading to Brush Bar again for an evening of painting fun. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cut it. \n\nThe service was indifferent, rude, and was clearly not interested in us just like the previous visit. We were seated right in the main dining room so no matter what our server had to do, he had to walk by us each and every time. He forgot drinks, food was served to us cold, didn't even bring the appetizer we ordered. If he tried any harder to ignore us, it would have been downright funny. \n\nThe biggest turn off was the glass of water he served to one of my dinner guests which was rimmed with ANTS. It was almost like they dipped the rim of the glass into a whole pile of the dead ants before serving it. How he missed it, I'll never know. It was disgusting. Not an apology. Not a discount offered. Nothing. \n\nThis was the most piss-poor service I have received in a restaurant in a long time and you can bet your last dime it's the last time Frank & Lupe's will ever see me or the 8 other guests I brought."
1,"Yes! Awesome soy cap, scone, and atmosphere. Nice place to hang out & read, and free WiFi with no login procedure."
1,"I've been waiting to try Pizzeria Bianco for a few years.  I've been an avid Grimaldi's fan for quite some time so I wanted to see how this place stacked up.  \n\nWe arrived a little before 4:00 and there were 2 groups waiting already.  Within about 10 minutes 8+ more groups arrived.  After bearing the 100 + degree weather we were finally let in at 5.  My group ordered a Margherita, Sonny Boy and Wise Guy.  It was the general consensus that the Sonny Boy was the best.   \n\nWhile the pizza was fantastic I don't think it trumps Grimaldi's.  I would definitely come back, but having to stand in line for at least an hour means it will be awhile before that happens.\n\nIf you love pizza you should definitely check this place out, at least once, to say you've been to the so-called \""Best Pizza in America\"""
1,"I have put off this review for a long long time for fear that our precious little lounge would be overrun by annoying crowds. But I have to give props where it is deserved and SideBar is on the top of my list. \n\nI first ventured to SideBar early this year after my best friend and I found it during a Yelp search. We got all fancied up and harassed in route at a dive bar we stopped at along the way. Pssh neanderthals they didn't know where we were heading. Well... neither did we. \n\nThis place is great. It is by far my favorite downtown spot. It has AMAZING music that is not too loud to converse over. You can expect to hear Portishead, reggae or something groovy. If it is First Friday most likely a DJ will be set up in the corner spinning. There is plenty of comfortable seating for your date and yourself or group of friends. It is chic and contemporary and you cant help but dig the exposed brick.\n\nTony at the bar is my favorite bartender in town and ALWAYS knows whats up. He introduced my best friend and I to Sammy Smiths Nut ale and Strongbow. This had me voting for SideBar in Phoenix's Best of for almost EVERY category. \n\nI have been to this hidden lounge a lot. I plan to keep venturing there and saying hello to Tony, but the prices are steep so my visits are seldom. Try Sundays if you are on a budget I hear they have 20% off happy hour."
0,"Always in search of a great Mexican Restaurant in Vegas and this ain't it! I wish someone would open a Tex Mex restaurant in town. Wishful thinking I suppose. Beyond disappointed, livid describes it better. 4 people cost $90! \n\nWalked in around 2 or 3 p.m., the place was dead-REALLY dead-no employees to be found anywhere! I literally had to go to the kitchen and ask if anyone was working in order to be seated! \n\nFinally seated, I inquired about a Margarita for Happy Hour and was told since I was in a booth, I would have to pay full price unless I wanted my entire party (me, hubs, 4 year old and 17 year old) to move to the bar! Total BS! We were literally the only people in the joint. You would think the goal would be repeat business or at least taking pride in their job. No such luck. Worst Margarita I've ever had and it made me sick for 2 days due to the rot gut Tequila, despite my request for top shelf alcohol. \n\nAppetizer was sparse and cost $17! Entrees were terrible and tasted like leftovers. Service was equally poor. No tea refills, no chip refills, no free queso like the sign on the table described. Waitress acted like she was in the weeds and we were her only table and in fact the only people in the entire place! I don't know how they stay open. \n\nDriving to Centennial to me is always a waste of time and this experience to me is pretty typical of the area and why I avoid it. \n\nWe won't be back. It was so bad that I really should call corporate."
1,"So I had heard a lot about Tacos El Gordo, but never thought much about it. I usually don't care for tacos that much, and it seemed like just another taco place to me. After my friends kept making a big deal about it, I decided to try it on a Monday night. Upon arriving, I was surprised at how many people were there, standing in line at 11 pm. Despite the long lines, the service was quick, prompt, and ran in a very strategic way.\n\nMy first visit there, I decided to try 2 adobada tacos with everything on them. Upon eating my first taco, I couldn't stop myself from shoving the second one in my mouth and getting back in line for more tacos. It was so tasty and flavorful! The sauces mixed so well with the juicy meat, and complemented each other perfectly. My second round I decided to try the carne asada tacos which also drove my taste buds wild. Everything tasted and actually was fresh! The meat and tortillas are made right in front of you, how can it get any better than that? \n\nTacos El Gordo is one of the best taco places here in Vegas. It gave me a reason to pay $2 for a taco, hopefully it amazes you too."
1,"My boyfriend and I went out for dinner there yesterday night while enjoying a nice night out together, and after our terrible experience with the place we had chosen for lunch, The Cheesecake Factory was a relief. Our service was exceptional, Laura waited on us and she couldn't have done a better job. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and let us take our time and choose what we wanted. Everything was absolutely delicious from the Georgia Peach I ordered from the bar menu to the S'mores Cheesecake I had for dessert. Keep it up CCF always a good choice and we will definitely be back!\n\nYummy - Orange chicken leftovers!!"

0,"I had heard Salerno's is a good option for Italian food in the east valley, so I decided to give it a try. I went about an hour before closing and was seated very promptly by a very friendly employee. \n\nI decided I would try the pasta and went with the manicotti. I thought it was a bit expensive compared to several other options (Casanova Brothers and Buono's) in the east valley, but went forward with it anyway. The manicotti came with a salad and bread, and I selected the Italian dressing. \n\nI received the salad and bread promptly. The salad contained fresh, crisp lettuce, but the dressing was very oily and lacked taste. The bread was decent, but nothing spectacular. Not too long after the salad came, the manicotti arrived. I was surprised to see it on a plate that was dripping sauce off the sides. I cannot recall ever going to an Italian restaurant and receiving a plate that so poorly contained the dish. The red sauce was fairly tasty, but the manicotti was bland in taste and was not hot enough. I wondered if it had been heated up rather than baked. The portion was large at least, so there was food to take home.\n\nOverall, I was not that impressed with my experience at Salerno's. Everything about the place including the service and decor was OK, but not particularly good or memorable except for the sweet employee who greeted me. I think I will stick with my other favorites for Italian food rather than returning here."
0,"This mall- eh\n\nIt's not horrible, but it's a waste of time. \n\nI visited from out of town and it was not worth my while.\n\nThe stores were your typical \""upscale\"" shops, but good luck finding anything with the pacs of shoppers looking to score \""deals\"". \n\nThe only stores worth going to are Gap outlet and J Crew factory. I was excited when I saw H&M but don't be fooled, it's not an outlet store so no \""special\"" deals there.\n\nAvoid the crowds, save the gas $ and go elsewhere. \n\nPros:\n- I got 2 dresses at Gap outlet for less than $20\n\nCons:\n- Crowded\n- Lack of selection\n- Not all stores are outlets even though this is an outlet mall\n- No food courts and when you put your credit card in the vending machine good luck getting your drink"
1,Just cuz i love bbq pork so much. I would definitely recommend this place to eat late night with the friends. I would love to try some other items from the menu
1,The best of everything. Really. The best poker room. The best waitresses. The best blackjack dealers and tables. Enough said.
0,"The yogurt was fine, atmophere is \""modern\"".  The issue we had is they didn't have any information on gluten.  My daughter has Celiac Disease and has to eat gluten free and they couldn't tell us anything.  The guy even stated many people have asked for this information."
0,"Can I give negative stars?...if so Tao would get a negative 2,000. I planned my sister's bachelorette party and could not have had a worse time. I paid for a bottle service and they wouldn't let two of the guests who contributed to the table service in... How is one suppose to have fun when not everyone is allowed in?!? I tried speaking to the \""manager\""of security and was met with pretentiousness and hostility...please do yourself a favor and do not come here if you want your group to have a good time. Overrated and I will never, ever come back here again.\n\nPs. People chain smoke in here, making it impossible to breath in addition to the rudeness you are met with at the door. Awful!!!!"
1,"I've been to Eldorado several times in my occasional travels to Madison. I've always enjoyed the food, drink, and service.  I have to say tonight's meal was the best I've ever had there--green chili meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens.  I don't like barbecue sauce, so I asked to have that on the side, and pretty much ignored it, but the meatloaf lacked for nothing in taste or moisture.  The mashed potatoes were garlicky and delicious, and the collard greens were not the wilted green mess I'm accustomed to (from my dear Southern mama), but lightly cooked, with a smoky flavor to them.  Every meal I've had at Eldorado has been delicious, but this one takes the cake.  (No, I had no room for cake or any other dessert, and in fact took away half of my meal as leftovers--which I very much look forward to consuming!)"
0,"Rose, pretty elegant at first glance. Rabbit, I went down the Rabbit Hole. Lie, this place isnt that great. Wagyu wasnt really wagyu. Strawberry Shortcake dessert was just crumbs that cost you $12. Im glad I ate here free but even so, not worth the money. And the show is closed, no dinner and show anymore. Lies!"
1,Huge portions and a healthy outlook on Mexican food.
0,Too slow. Dish tastes so so.
0,"Went to this place in the Rio (not the one on Spring Mountain) for dinner. Pricing was high, but food was good tasting. Service kinda sucked though. Pretty much was ignored. Difficult to get drink refills. It was not the stereotypical \""rude\"" wait staff, it was plain being ignored. I would give 4 stars for food quality itself, but price/value and being ignored gets a significant knockdown in my book. Think I'll go back to the original KJ on SpringMountain."
0,The people who made the penguin what it is were pushed out by the late property owners greedy ass daughter. WILL NEVER SPEND A DIME HERE
0,I'm giving this place a one star review for one reason only. The bartender Danielle is horrible! Never seen a bartender with such a horrible attitude and I honestly don't know how she still has a job.
0,"I've stayed here many times over the years and the Four Seasons has always been my first choice, but the number of dogs on the property has seriously gotten out of control. On my recent stay I could almost literally not get on the elevator without someone's little yapper trying to bite my ankles, and I almost never walked down the main hall to the lobby without one or more dogs being walked in the hallway. It takes the ambience from elegant to trailer park in a hurry. Fortunately there are no shortage of 5-star hotels in Las Vegas to choose from."
0,"Two stars... one simply because they had cars available and one because they were cheap.  And, if you ask me, the second one should NOT be your motivation for renting a car from here.  \n\nI really think service in this place is god-awful.  Came here with a friend who was visiting and needed to rent a car to drive to Phoenix.  Got here around 11:30 after striking out at McCarran's rental car center.  \n\nThe salesperson helped us immediately but took FOREVER to find out how much the drop off fee would be.  My husband had a quote from Orbitz up on his phone - the drop fee was $160 and the total quote was for $262.  He came back to the desk and told us the best price out the door was $343.  OK, so I understand they have special rates that are only offered on these websites and they may not be able to extend them in-store, but once my husband showed him the Orbitz quote he quickly typed something into his computer and stated, \""I can get you down to $271.\""  Really?  Your best price was $343 and now it's $271?  My friend was so tired of searching for cars (barely any of the rental places at the Mccarran Rental car center had any and the ones who did were charging over $400!) that she didn't want to waste time booking it online or haggling over the 9 bucks.    \n\nThe guy obnoxiously kept pushing protection on my friend, and arguing our reasoning for refusing it, despite us clearly wanting to get out of there.  I know it's part of their job but once is enough.  I'm sorry if we haven't helped you meet your insurance-selling quota.  Get over it. \n\nWe get outside to get the car.  No one was at the booth but two employees were washing vehicles right out in front.  Nobody acknowledged us and we had to speak up to get an employee's attention.  That employee yelled out to another employee, \""Hey, can you help them?\"" and that employee yelled out into space to another employee who was nowhere to be seen LOL.  What kind of circus is this??  \n\nFinally a nice employee came and pointed to a row of cars.  \""Choose one from that row,\"" he said.  My friend chose the first car in the row - a fiat.  She'd booked an economy car and it certainly seemed small enough to be one but what the heck do we know about cars?  We drove it up to the security booth for them to inspect it and let us out. \n\nThe woman at the booth inspected the car and documented the many scratches and dings on the outside of it.  My friend was politely trying to point out to her all of the stains on the leather seats - coffee maybe?  \""Did anyone even clean the interior of this car?\"" I wondered.  The woman then handed my friend the slip to sign and stated, in a somewhat snarky way, \""You somehow managed a very large upgrade. I don't know how you did it.\"" My friend tells her that we were told to pick a car out from that row and she chose the first one.  Would she like us to return it and choose another?  She responded, \""No, I'm just saying... it's a good upgrade.  So... enjoy it.\""  Oh yeah.  Great big upgrade.  Shitbox with coffee stains inside lol.  I'm sure Fiats are very nice cars.  But obviously not when you rent them from fox. \n\nIf price is the ONLY reason you'd rent from here then you'll be pleased.  But you really are getting what you pay for.  I'd sooner take a bus, walk, bike ride, or any other form of transportation than rent a car from Fox.  Just saying."

1,"For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start.  We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us.  The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming.\n\nBuilt within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar.  Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that!  They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road.  The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black & white photos on the dark red walls.  If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows.  Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love \""seeing behind the curtain\"" and watching the action.  I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space.\n\nThe menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty.  We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin ($6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread.  We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three.  For entrees I had the Portabella stew ($11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage ($14) and was also pleased.  Portions were fair sized, enough for dinner for each of us, not really enough to take home for lunch the next day.  Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta.  The greens were good, the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested.  \n\nThis is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta & asked for feedback, which we provided.  He did say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything, of course, so they appreciate hearing customer's thoughts on the food. (Well, you know we're not shy!).  We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape.  A few minutes later, the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza.  Yum!  Dense chocolate cake, rich and sweet, a perfect end to the meal.\n\nI liked the cozy space, it looks like they'll have some fun specials during the week, there were several things that tempted me on the menu, parking was easy, prices were reasonable, service was great... all in all, we look forward to heading back again."
1,One more fantastic spot that I've driven by and not stopped in. BIG MISTAKE! 10$ om let and potatoes that ranks up with the best. Going to be part of my routine now.... can't wait to hit more of this cool menu!
0,"On my last trip to Pittsburgh, I saw Primanti and thought this is a must try. It's a local institution with awesome sandwiches and pop, right?  On this trip, I was able to fit it in - it was an experience that I don't need to experience again.   I hadn't looked at the reviews so I didn't realize that it was so limiting - essentially a meat and cheese on gigantic white bread with vinegar based coleslaw and fries.\nI asked the server for a recommmendation and went with the pastrami and cheese - it was fine - a huge sandwhich and I was super hungry and was able to eat most of it but it's just not my thing.\nKudos to Primanti for knowing how to provide a big sandwich with just the right balance of toppings.  Only the coleslaw overflowed.\nThey go light on the cheese but it's a good thing.  You will be full after eating here and probably will not want to eat anything or look at food for a long while.\n\nVegetarians and people on gluten free diets should stay away in my opinion - the options would be very very limiting."

1,"My friend and I stopped by the American Fish bar area for a small snack before heading to Viva Elvis (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cirque-du-soleil---viva-elvis-las-vegas#hrid:4AnaBZgo6J3ichCpap8UJQ).\n\nWe just missed their happy hour.  What a bummer.  They have a list of about 10 different appetizers to nosh at the bar, all which sound amazing.  We pared it down to 4 items for $28.  The more you buy, the lower the price (up to 4).  We made the correct the assumption that the portions would be as tiny as they possibly could be, but the quality made up for the quantity.\n\nWe ordered Tuna Tartare, Mac n' Cheese w/ Truffles, Lobster Corn dogs, and Oysters.  The presentation was legit, and everything was amazingly tasty as anticipated.\n\nTo drink, I tried a Prado.  I was intrigued because it has egg white in it.  It also has White Tequila, Maraschino Liqueur, Grenadine Syrup, Lemon Juice and Lime.  It took two bartenders to make it.  I think this is just because they weren't that busy at the time.\n\nI'd for sure go back for their happy hour pricing of $5 per item.  The waitress said some patrons order everything on the menu.  I think it easily could be done between a few people with any sort of appetite and a taste for semi-exotic, high class food."
1,"Stopped in for a SUnday brunch whilst visiting in Pitt and were treated to a tasty meal.  I opted for the sweet with Cinnamon Sugar french toast that was supposed to be a cinn-bun spin but didn't quite deliver.  They oversold the \""icing\"" which didn't really exist and played it off with \""it's on the outside\"" referring to the crust.  No, that is not icing, that's a glaze.  Still, it was tasty and the bacon was really nice. The husband got the potato benny with poached egg,  hollandaise, and salmon (our friend got the corned beef on his) and it was delicious.  I would TOTALLY order that again.  In fact, i might make that for breakfast tomorrow....  =)  All meals came with a fruit salad that was an odd mix of fruits with a flavor that did not blend and i, and avid fruit and veggie lover, did not care for the flavor.\n\nThis could have been a 5-er...  So close, yet so far.  The big knock down came when i read on the menu \""maple syrup\"" and what they had was not in fact REAL maple syrup but flavored corn syrup.  Sorry, i'm a real maple syrup girl and if you don't know the difference...  It's just weird, but i'm an upstate NY gal.  That aside, it was a delightful meal for a decent price."
0,"Before reaming these guys, I will start by saying I really appreciated the Friday night quick delivery and thought the wings were good.  With that said...\n\nIf you like thick doughy pizza, defrosted translucent-wilted salad, and rude customer service from a manager by the name of Kendra, then BOY do we have a pizza place for you.\n\nPretty much, everyone knows that salad is one of the riskiest items on any menu, being one of the biggest bacteria carriers.  Our disappointment with this order began with what we found in the garden salad container.\n\nMy wife, being ServSafe certified, noticed a significant portion of lettuce (which seemed to have been frozen and thawed) which was translucent and visually unappealing.   We've posted the photos so you can see for yourself, but unfortunately Yelp removed them on 12/14/12 because \""...your photos looked more like they captured your personal experience\"".  Umm k.\n\nMy wife phoned to bring this to the attention of a manager.  She politely explained that they may want to check their salad, to keep other customers safe, and requested a refund (for the price of the salad only).  I listened in, and can confirm how polite she was.  The manager, Kendra, wanted to give us credit instead.\n\nMy wife explained that we don't plan on ordering from Barro's in the future, and would just like the salad price refunded.  The obviously annoyed Kendra replied \""OK!\"" and then hung the phone up.  No apology, no thanks for reporting potentially out of temperature food.  Nothing but the echo of a dial tone in our receiver.\n\nThe pizza tasted good, but the texture is accommodating to those who prefer a thick and doughy crust.\n\nThere are too many other pizza places to put up with potentially tainted food and substandard customer service.  No thanks Barro's."

0,"Why does the filet mignon taste like carne asada? \n\nSo upset that my meal wasn't as delicious as usual, actually so upset I probably won't be coming back for a long while. My boyfriend and I would always come to Herbs n Rye for our steak and potato fix. Usually, it would always hit the spot, but not this time. It seems like its under new management (not a good thing). I have a few things to complain about, I suppose, and I hardly ever complain about my experiences with food. This is actually my first yelp review. \n\nI'm pretty damn sure they raised their prices on a few food items. The filet mignon happened to be one of them. That's my usual with a few sides. The sides were up to par with my past experiences, but the filet mignon is the reason for this review. It used to be $34 for it (not happy hour) and now it's $10 more! The worst part about this is the fact that my filet tasted nothing like a filet mignon! If anything, it tasted like carne asada. The meat wasn't cooked medium well (what I ordered), it was completely well-done. I don't know what the hell is up with this \""butterfly cook method\"" but no. Never again. The meat was not tender at all, usually it \""melts\"" in my mouth, and it wasn't thick or rounded like how a filet mignon is supposed to look. Maybe it wasn't even a filet mignon, even though the bill said it was. Also, not impressed with the service or that techno/electronic music shit like every other restaurant in Vegas. I'm going to miss that classy vibe from Herbs n Rye:("
0,"Beer's cold, problem is the 2 times I've been there so too has the service.  Sometimes you need a cheap Mexican food fix and this is the place for it.  This place is IN Mandalay Place..... I'd suggest spending the extra couple of bucks on food at Border Grill in Mandalay Bay for more upscale and flavorful Mexican cuisine."
0,"Been here a few times.Yes they are more honest than other places, but still are not completely honest.Also their prices are way higher than most places.Was told when I brought my Lincoln in for so something minor that my transmission was \""going\"".Well that was 2 years ago, and transmission is still fine.Also they charge almost double for parts if you get through them.Can buy online for way cheaper.Even other auto shops charge half of what they do for parts and labor.They warranty their batteries and parts, but if you ever need to use said warranty they will fight you tooth and nail.Also took them 3 hours to perform a simple 1 hour job.I don't get why everyone reccomends them."
0,"The food is eatable, although it tends to fall heavily on your stomach. Fairly mediocre overall, although not disgusting. \n\nBut why, why do the waiters feel the need to clean the table in the small space with very strong cleaning products while you are eating? why?

Our server was incredibly friendly and very attentive.  My pizza was pretty good and my wife's cannelloni was fantastic.  Our desserts were amazing (tartufo for me, cherry cheesecake for my wife). Next time we are in the area I'm sure we'll be returning.  I Highly advise making a reservation as getting a table without one is near impossible."
0,2.5/5\n\nThe food here was simply OK. The sushi was anything-but-fresh bordering on questionable. Their chopped up lobster chunks were plentiful and decent. The hot shrimp was probably my favorite thing. The spicy chicken was actually spicy. The beef was terrible as expected at a seafood place. The soft serve dessert was too icy. \n\nNo one got sick and the service was good for what was.
1,Hands down best place in town for authentic Eastern european food.

I even brought my aunt when she came from Ukraine and she absolutely loved it. Would recommend to everyone.

0,"No me gusta. No me gusta at all.\n\nThis should be my favorite place in Las Vegas: Artisan Burgers and amazing beer both local and foreign. Even the service was grand. What went horribly wrong? There are two factors that make this place a definitive nope: one is the price of everything is out of touch with reality. Sure this is in the Mandalay Bay on the strip, but it's actually in one of those weird connector mini-malls we have so many of. This is a very nice retail passageway, but it's not actually Mandalay Bay proper. Even if it were I am sure I could find a greater value in food virtually anywhere else in the Mandy.\n\nThe problem isn't just the prices, which are certainly atrocious, it's just that the burgers aren't good. I had the Hubert Keller signature burger. It wasn't great. The meat wasn't particularly flavorful,  the red wine and shallots sauce was vinegary and the side of the chipolte aioli was bland and seemed old. The Buffalo was dry the previous time I came here and I chalked it up to being the nature of the meat. It's not, I've had spectacular buffalo since and much better value.\n\nThe beer list is utter torture. It's glorious in it's depth and yet should anyone actually pay those prices they should immediately be carved into servings and fed to starving African Children. A handy strip mark-up is one thing, within reason. But charging eight times retail for a beer readily available at local gas stations almost almost makes me want to go all Reductio ad Hitlerum up in this review. I scoured the beer menu and could not find a purchase I was willing to make. I cannot remember the last time I went to a restaurant such as this and just had a soda. I actually did not purchase a beer.\n\nIf you can afford this place go to a burger restaurant that actually has decent food. Better yet check out \u00e9 by jos\u00e9 andr\u00e9s and save a few bucks."

0,"Yes, CLT is clean and it's central area connecting the terminals is brightly lit from the wall-o-windows, and offers plenty of eating/shopping options.  I'll give it that.\n\nNow, CLT is USAIRWAYS' fortress hub, meaning they dominate this place.  This is not a good thing being that USAIR tops the list for things like lost and/or mishandled baggage, customer complaints, percentage of flights late 70% of the time or more, and the lowest % of flights arriving on time.  So now you're saying, well that's USAIR's fault, not CLT's.

1,"I'm fairly sure if there were a medical condition to describe cocktail addiction, I would have it. For that reason, I am in love with this bar.\n\nAs a student you automatically get any cocktail normally up to the value of \u00a37 (pretty much all of them) for \u00a33.50... Winner. And, as my drink of choice is a dirty vodka martini I was pleased to see that, despite my best efforts on several occasions, I couldn't drink them out of olives and Noilly Prat. The whole place has a relaxed vibe to it and yet it's never boring; in fact during the evenings this place attracts a sizeable crowd. When you see how many different spirits, and how many different types of each spirit they have, it's not difficult to see why.\n\nWhy did I only give it 4 stars then? They've recently put all the cocktail prices up by 5p so that most of them are now worth \u00a37.05 and thus no longer valid on the snapfax deal (I know that sounds really tight but I am a student at the end of the day). And also the loos... If there's one thing that I never like to see when I go into the Ladies' it's a cold-as-ice aluminium toilet seat. Ever.\n\nIt's still by far one of the best bars in the grassmarket area. If you like cocktails even a tiny little bit and you're ever within a ten mile radius of this bar, go."

0,"I ordered delivery from here because of the good reviews. It wasn't gross, but it wasn't good either. I don't understand how all the flavor can be sucked out of thai food. I have definitely had better."
0,"This is not gourmet or a charming hole-in-the-wall. It's a gas station restaurant. \n\nYes, one half is devoted to dispensing fossil fuels, the other to refried beans. Do not expect miracles.  \n\nThey will give you the largest chips you have ever seen.  They will also give you refried beans and salsa.  Fancy.\n\nFood is basic and will meet your Tex-Mex needs.  Do not expect an authentic experience.\n\nAlso, in case you were wondering, the restaurant does not smell like gasoline."
0,"While I have never dined at this restaurant, I am giving this a 1 star for my experience with them over the phone. I was trying to order a bottle of sake for my friend who is celebrating her birthday there this evening because I am out of state. The hostess was very helpful and went to find the manager. The manager told her they could not do it. How do you take reservations for your karaoke rooms? Over the phone credit cards... Basically a lazy manager who did not want to help make a night more special for my friend. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years, and that is not hospitality. So though I live in LA the next time I visit Phoenix, this will not be a place I will be stopping by. Great job!"
1,"This place has bad reviews but I'm not really sure why?\n\nYes, you'll pay a dollar or 2 more for a burger here then you would in main street, Any Town, USA but you are at New York, NY hotel on the Vegas Strip.  Nothing is cheap here, not even the hot dog from the other stand.  \n\nI got a smoked chicken salad on arugula, goat cheese, walnuts and a yummy vinaigrette dressy.  Warning, the goat cheese came fried in a ball, but it was delicious!  The salad is large and a great portion of chicken,\n\nBF got the a turkey burger with some toppings that seemed solid enough to me.\n\nThe server was really nice, we explained we had less than 30 minutes until our Cirque show started.  She explained all burgers are made to order and will take 20 minutes.  Our food came out in 20 minutes, she had our checks and everything ready.\n\nAlso, since the bar was limited to beer and wine, we were allowed to bring drinks from other bars inside which I know a lot of places frown upon."
0,"Even though they have some interesting stuff in store, the service is lacking severely. Next door to Savers, we came in looking for remote helicopters. The owner had to bitch at his teenage son to get him to come help us. We come back to next day to purchase one and he tells us after it has rung up that there is a sale on helicopters that day. \n\nWell gee, I would have liked to have know that before so perhaps I could have picked out a better, more expensive model. He didn't really offer any info on anything but just kept flying that helicopter all over the store. Just really bad immature service and their selection is not the most extensive I have seen, but I was really interested in the items they offered in the store."
1,"T. Cook's is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  I've lived in SF, NYC, and LA, which is where I am from and currently reside.  I haven't had much luck in LA in terms of finding really good \""Western\"" food.  I love LA for its ethnic food. \n\nI've eaten at T. Cook's three times now since I'm staying at the Royal Palms Resort.  Tonight's dinner was OUTSTANDING.  I ordered the sea scallops with shrimp mac & cheese.  It was so good.  Even the accompaniments were delicious - the spinach and the corn kernels.  The corn kernels tasted like they were first soaked in vinegar so it was a nice surprise and really complemented the dish.  For dessert, I had the Napoleon.  It was so delicate.  The crisp was so thin on top of a chocolate mousse.  I loved it.\n\nMy mom had the \n\nI'm definitely coming back next time I'm in town."
0,"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/battistas-hole-in-the-wall-las-vegas?select=fp3gb-ENJa1b3pi-impq3A\n\nI have a friend who loves this place so much that she is having her wedding reception here. When she found out that we were heading to Las Vegas six weeks ago she insisted we had to check this place out. Attached is a picture of me outside the restaurant. Obviously it was taken before we dined because I am smiling.\n\nFormulaic beyond description! The wait staff have everything down to such a science that there is absolutely no warmth. They bring you free, undrinkable wine and point to the menu on the wall. You order from a handful of traditional and delicious-sounding Italian entrees, ranging in price from about $25.00 to about $50.00.  Immediately after ordering they bring a mealy iceberg salad in a wooden bowl, or soup, and some garlic bread which was fine. \n\nI had the chicken parmesan. It was clearly reconstituted, formed, frozen and reheated. I love Italian food and am fond of saying that I have never met a plate of spaghetti I didn't like. I ate one bite of the chicken and tried the spaghetti and pushed it to the side. My husband really tried to eat his spaghetti too but we just couldn't do it. The sauce is weirdly sweet and off-putting. It was just bad and his too, was pushed to the edge of the table. The wait staff are trained or have learned the hard way not to inquire when diners do this because 1) he didn't ask if there was a problem, when clearly there was. He just briskly removed the offending plates, and 2) all they would do all night is have conversations about their bad food..\n\nThe \""cappuccino\"" included with my dinner was half Carnation Instant Cocoa and half Folger's Crystals. Again, undrinkable and removed without a word when pushed aside.\n\nThe ambiance is great...red and white tablecloths, pictures of Vegas legends all over the walls (behind my husband), and high wooden booths. I know this place was popular back in the day but clearly things here are not as they once were.\n\nI was legit hungry when we left and grabbed a burger at In and Out...it rocked."
1,"Love the samosa factory. The staff are delightful, food delicious & such a pleasant atmosphere. I've taken family & friends here & everyone loved it. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for some delicious Indian food!"
1,"The pizza would be a 3 star in my pizza rankings, but the friendly staff, great prices, and homey atmosphere earn this place a star bump. I was pretty disappointed in my lunch special pizza. I've been to NYC quite a bit, eaten a LOT of NY pizza and folks this aint it ! I did love the family vibe, and they treated me so well - I just wish the pizza was better. It was like warmed over mall food court type stuff. It *does* remind me of the food court pizzas I've eaten while in the city (Villa pizza in NYC comes to mind), but nothing special. I need to make it over there again beacuse clearly I caught them on a bad day, but unfortunately it's been a month and I still can't bring myself to go back !"
0,"OK so I've eaten here a few different times and every time its been great. Tonight though i had them deliver dinner because they do offer delivery and was pretty disappointed. I got the brushetta, the pot roast and the chocolate cake for dessert (all for my wife and I to share). The brushetta bread was burnt, the actual brushetta was literally soaked with balsamic vinaigrette so it was pretty mushy and the pot roast looked like it might have been sitting around a while because when we got it the gravy had already cooled down and looked kind of like a jelly substance. Now I know that none of these problems would have happened had we gone in to eat at the restaurant, but I feel like we were taken advantage of because we were not sitting inside the restaurant and they knew that we would not be able to send the food back. For reference, I live about a block away from the restaurant so there's no way that it would've cooled down that much or for the brushetta to saturate in the vinaigrette. What they also fail to tell you over the phone when you order is that they already include gratuity so you don't get the choice on how much you get to give. Overall, definitely dissapointed in the food quality."
1,"We were so fortunate to get two seats at the bar of Emeril's NO Fish House at the MGM Grand in Vegas!!!  This place was packed, most of us waiting in great anticipation for Neil Diamond's concert just around the corner.  We had to stand like sharks and wait to grab our seats as the next guests left, but boy were we glad we did!   We spent the next hour or so enjoying a fabulous lemon creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and several cocktails.  As many of you know, I'm on the hunt for \""real, original, great looking and tasting\"" appletinis and I finally found it at Emeril's!  However, it was only because I spoke to the bartender personally about the ingredients he would used and asked him to substitute \""sweet and sour\"" with Midori.   With that settled, I receive the beautiful, bright green appletini with that burst of flavor only Pucker & Midori can deliver.   I asked for another (not realizing my bartender had changed) and he brought me the cheap, sweet & sour, dirty-martini-looking drink and I told him that was not what I had previously and then had to tell him how to make it).  At least I held my ground and didn't just drink it to be nice.   At $17 to $20 a pop for cocktails in Vegas - get what YOU want, not what you are SERVED!!!   We had such a good time at this bar.  It is absolutely gorgeous and the crowd was fun.  We even had the Neil Diamond look-alike sitting three chairs away from us.  It was too funny - he looked just like Neil did in the 70's!  He, He.  ONLY IN VEGAS!!!"
0,"Where do I start?\n\nThe Tea Room is an open area between the bar and the front desk. The \""tables\"" are about the same height as an end table, so I feel like I am sitting at a kids table. They should have the tea served in the bar using real adult sized tables.\n\nThe tea is not steeped at the table, they just bring it out (one pot)  already made. \n\nHow can you have a high tea without cucumber sandwiches?\n\nAfter the tea was served the waitress never came back.\n\nThe food was very good but the portion size was tiny, we ate here as a late lunch and were still very hungry when we left. \n\nThere is an automatic gratuity added to the bill, cannot remember how much it was. What incentive do they have to provide decent service when they know up front they are getting a good tip?\n\nOverall it was not really a relaxing and lush experience as it should be."
0,Pulling in and we were directed to a new lane opening up. But we ended up waiting for a half an hour in this new line. Horribly managed place. Apparently their equipment broke down. We ended up missing the beginning of the movie with no apology from them.
1,"Very friendly service!  This DD takeover is certainly an improvement over the former crap that was located at this corner.  I found the space to be welcoming and adequate for hanging out, having a latte while waiting to be seated at Pinky's."
1,"If its your first or 5th time in Vegas, this is a MUST! The view is amazing! Great place to relax over drinks after a long day and unwind with some good music!"
0,"The Luxor seems to have lost a bit of its nice-ness over the years, once known as one of the premier hotels when it first opened with a very modernized look and feel, now its trying hard to compete with the newer hotels on the strip - and with good reason\n\nOn my rescent trip there I ended up at the last minute needing a room in vegas for work, so I figured Id go here since it had been about a year and when I was last there they were in the middle of a re-model so I figured id give it a shot - and I was able to find rooms pretty cheap for a weekend stay.\n\nMost of the remodel was done the lounges in the main pyramid were finished and looking nice but they were still lacking in what other casino lounges offer - seating was crowded and service was bad, even on Thursday night when it was slow - prices for drinks were pretty high for a casino that is on the south end of the strip \n\nYour key cards that gets you into your room is also used to get the elevator moving - basically so noone can just go up the sideways moving elevator - heres the catch ...the key cards dont always work well, one time it took so long to get the card to respond in the elevator the lights inside turned off ....once it finally responded to my random button pushing the lights turned on ...but definatly a pain when your hands are full and you have to dig out your room card \n\nHere is another fun one -since the key cards didnt work well in the elevator....they didnt work well when trying to get into my room either I think I stood there for at least 5 mintues one night trying to get in ...and it wasnt cause I had been drinking over priced drinks in the bar \n\nMy basic room was ok - a very typical cheap hotel room in Vegas..my TV was small and had no remote controll - so I had to get up to change the channel every time I wanted to watch something else - which was a real pain. I brought my lap top with me to be able to do some work with my down time in my room but the internet access was absolute crap the wireless couldnt link up at all and it was a big waste of time. So why is there an additional $12 resort fee a day with this place if you cant use the dam internet at least, and not everyone is going to spend their day at the pool. Oh the 12 bucks does include 2 bottles of very cheap and small bottles of water in your room everyday.\n\nNo bathtub in my room just a shower no big deal for me but others may want to relax a bit more than just standing there. \n\nThe sports book is lacking to say the least-it still looks the same from when it first opened, its almost like the Luxor is a bit 50-50 with its remodel and the way the rest of the casino is looking. \n\nThe buffett there which I alwasy thought was one of the best in Vegas is dam near 30 bucks a person ! What ever happened to the cheap buffett's in Vegas?\n\nAbout the only good thing is the Luxor has quick access to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur, but I wonder if the Luxor is like this - how bad is Excalibur and Mandalay ?"
0,"A big disappointment. Greens were aerated a few weeks ago and were in terrible shape. Had we been told about this, would have played elsewhere.  Course play management was non existent which slowed us down. Overall, a forgettable course. Much better places to play when in Las Vegas."
1,"It's always a bonus if you find yourself sitting down in a pub or a coffee shop and see copies of The Skinny lying about. Compared to the double glazing ads and out of date non-news you get in most free papers, it's journalistic heaven.\n\nCompared to papers you'd actually pay for it's not that bad either, It's a bit up it's own arse at times, but if you're interested in what's going on slightly left of centre in the music, film, media and art scenes across Scotland, then it's probably the best publication currently available, free or not.\n\nGranted, some of the content an writing will appeal only to the most insufferable arseholes who bore you senseless by wittering on about the latest no-mark band they've found on Myspace, but even taking that into account there's plenty of reading to be had here."
1,"Switch really was an interesting place. I love the atmosphere, it's definitely high-end. My down-to-earth jock/geek husband wouldn't go there with me on date night, so I went with a girl friend of mine.\nThe food was really great, and the server was lovely. If you want a fun night out, and a place that's worthy of your little black dress and sky-high heels, this is it!"
0,"They give you alot of food... and I don't blame them for trying to get it out the kitchen because its horrible.  The fried steak meal was bland. . It was like eating hospital food. The beef nachos are way over priced, the chips were old. I wouldn't recommend it."
0,"I still love Smashburger, as we love their burgers - still great flavor!  But recently they have made menu changes and took off some of the items I loved. \n\nAnother big change, they changed their fries.  The smashfries recipe is still the same, but the actual fries have changed, which changes the flavors.  I do not like the new fries.\n\nI don't get why so many companies change what works and what people have come to love.  Maybe because they can get a better price with things, but these changes come at the expense of the customer.\n\nWe will now not likely go and will go try other burger places, such a big disappointment Smashburger."
0,"Great looking place, expected a really classy experience.  What we got was a waitress who didn't introduce herself or greet us, clear our plates or fill our drinks.  What we also got was food that would have been just slightly above average had it actually been hot.  The food was lukewarm, refried beans had a burned taste, chips were stale, the fried ice cream was obviously fried a few days ago so it pretty much just looked like a big ball of ice cream that had been rolled in cornflakes.  Not to mention we didn't get the extra garnishes the table next to us got.  We won't be going back, there are way too many other places that are worth the money."
0,"no preface, no disclaimers, and no tip-toeing here.\n\nthe truth of the matter is -- Zinburger needs to live up to their name a bit better. one would expect tasty, delicious burgers from a resto that has the word \""burger\"" in it?\n\ntwo out of four of our diners ordered red meat beef burgers - one was the kobe, and one was the zinburger. the kobe burger was not juicy, and the burger patty fell apart when cut. the zinburger actually seemed to do better, at least, by holding itself together! overall, the burgers lacked embellishment and that something special that i could not get from McD's (at least i might get a toy there?).\n\nremarks for the ahi tuna sandwich included \""not good, it gave me a tummy ache. they lied to me! they gave me lettuce instead of cole slaw\""\n\nfeedback for the chicken sandwich was \""pretty good, but spicy\"". that's probably why this diner had three beers to go along with it. hehe.\n\nsweet potato fries vs. zucchini fries - sweet potato wins for being proper fries that do not fall apart (a recurring theme). zucchini fries dip wins though.\n\nit's a great concept, which was what initially drew us into the resto, but execution? i might need a couple more bottles of Zin to swallow this one down!"
0,Very annoying young staff yelling alot also in that whiny girl voice. Wifi and reception stinks as well. Not a good place to conduct business as they don't clean the tables or floors either. Damn..they won't shutup. Gotta leave.
0,"Service is non-existent.  Ordered 5 drinks.  Took forever.  A group came in wtih a large dog while we were sitting waiting for our drinks.  The dog was served a bowl of water and a large carrot that he tore up all over the patio while we were stil waiting for our five drinks.  A table next to us had an issue with a bowl of something.  The waiter was holding the bowl in the air.  One of the people in my group asked the waiter what was wrong with it.  The waiter, still holding the bowl, looks over and yells back, there's a hair in it.  We had ordered a couple of sandwhiches.  With the waiter's info, we went up and canceled our order and left.  Good luck to anyone wanting to be served and wanting clean food."
0,"Let me start off by saying the Health Department needs to visit this place. Doh sushi has a serious problem with temperature control, they must store their food at unsafe temperatures. Trust me I came here with an opened mind and its not hard to please me with sushi, I love it regardless but honestly STAY AWAY. I'm calling it now, the next salmonella food poisoning spot.\n\nAmbiance: \nCute the decor, dark dimmed, with twinkle lighting. Rustic, felt warm and inviting. Looks like a nice place for a date but looks aren't everything....\n\nSeaweed Salad: \nWhen I sit I automatically order seaweed salad. I had high hopes for this place because their seaweed salad was delicious. Lightly sauced and it still had that crunch of freshness, but you can't really ruin seaweed salad.\n\nBaked green muscles: \nI should say NOT SO BAKED, so my first encounter with their issue of bad temperature. Please refer to my photo, notice that the mayo isn't baked at all. When the order first came out I thought it was a slice of cheese on muscle, and the muscles were cold. Told our server, she apologized and sent out another order, the worst part. It was exactly the same, cold and not baked. \n\nNigiri Salmon Sushi: \nYou know when you leave raw fish out for awhile and then store it at unsafe temperatures it develops this opaque slime layer. Yeah, totally what they served us. The salmon was slimy and not fresh at all. The rice to fish ratio was more rice than fish. Honestly when a sushi restaurant starts cutting corners to gain more profit, their food sucks.\n\nNigiri Yellow Tail Sushi:\nAlso slime layer, more rice to fish ratio. Wasn't happy.\n\nNot so hot Tea:\nNot sure how the hell you mess up hot tea. Okay I understand you don't want to burn customers but warm closer to cold tea isn't considered hot tea. \n\nService:\nNot so great, our tea was never hot. Our server forgot orders, never brought orders out, brought orders that weren't ours out, and we had to send back an order. \n\nLast Note:\nSuper fail sushi night. As you can see, I barely ordered anything. It was so awful I was afraid to continue to eat because I didn't want food poisoning."
0,"While the food was good, we will not be returning, nor would we recommend this place to anyone else--unless you'd like service that's excruciatingly slow, and pretentious, snooty servers and managers.There are other delicious restaurants in Pittsburgh who can offer this quality of food WITH good service as well. Not worth the wait/ snub/ annoyance!"
1,This place is awesome!  I love the chicken strip basket. My husband loves the cole slaw here. Yummy!
0,I have to say I wasn't too impressed with this place. Food was ok but the service was pretty awful. No salsa or drink refills. Ive been twice now and I don't think I'll go again.
0,I was not impressed with this clinic. \nPros:\n1. The vet did tell us where to find pet meds for a cheaper price\n\nCons: \n1.Their website was not up to date as far as their location and address. \n2. The staff was not very friendly. \n3. I felt very rushed to get in and out \n4. Received a card in the mail and thought it might be a welcome note but it was a request for referrals!
0,"I have golfed at this course for several years and it has always had issues with some of the greens along with other issues as well.  The sand traps are awful but the worse part is the staff.  This weekend finally pushed me away for good.  I went to hit balls on the range with my wife and they were having issues with their credit card machine.  This is the statement that came directly from the old so called golf pro at the counter.  I asked if he could try again so he did but then about five other people walked into the shop and he totally changed his attitude.  When he saw everyone waiting he then stated, \""your credit card has been denied.  You need to call your bank and see if there is an issue with target from the issue they have going on.\""  I asked him what the heck he was talking about  and told him I had just used my cards before arriving at the course.  He insisted, really loud so I asked him what an issue from several months ago had to do with my cards today.  He kept saying it over and over and was incredibly rude so I left.  My co-workers and I have golfed there for many years on Friday after work but this will no longer be the case.  This guy was as rude as it gets without using vulgar language.  Cheap course, cheap service, never again."

1,"I've ordered pizza here for years. It's good, friendly service, quick delivery, and it's down the street. It's not greesy like Napoli's and the crust is amaZING!\n\nI love this place and will order from here always. They have tons of other items on the menu but I've always just gotten the pizza."
1,Best sushi I've had so far in Charlotte! Make sure you try their Coastal Roll; my husband and I were floored by the sushi quality and the price!\n\nWonderful restaurant and evening all around!
1,"I lived in little Tokyo in LA and nothing in Vegas can quite compare, however, this place is about as good as it gets.  They offer all you can eat, (which can save you a ton on your bill if you like to go all out like my girlfriend and I!) Its always a bit packed so expect to have a short wait.  The place is small and cozy,  but boasts some of the best sauces and freshest fish in town.  I highly recommend the Salmon/lemon roll.  They also let you order half rolls which is nice to try out new things.  If you are going for sushi in Vegas, eat here first."
0,"I will never come back to this place. Went there for lunch, i paid for lunch price and my husband the dinner price. Waitress will not let me order my husbands choices that was only available for dinner price. Why does iit matter? Theres a limit 1on their special sushi anyway. Even the dessert i wanted mochi and she said it was only available for the dinner price. And her point was? So my husband had to actually order it since he paid for the dinner price.nbad bad service"
0,"Brand new, but lacking luster.  \n\nThe descriptions on the menu belie the actual appetizers and entrees.  This \""gastropub\"" was suggested to me for happy hour by a colleague.  At first appearances the menu suggests interesting twists on standard pub fair, but don't be fooled.  I ordered the \""dewedged\"" salad that claims pancetta as an ingredient.  What actually appeared on my plate was cold chewy bacon bits.  The consensus at the table was that the food fell far short of what was touted by the waitress as being made predominantly in-house.\n\nThere's a caveat to the $2 can Tuesday happy hour: It only applies to beers $4.50 and under.  Sadly, the beer selection is limited generally.  The beer selection priced at $4.50 and under forces you to choose from run-of-the-mill beers like Red Stripe, Blue Moon, and Yuengling.\n\nI had a better experience at Industry Public House in Lawrenceville."
0,Driver did not show up. Had to call him myself to ask if he was coming. The other driver he sent was over 20 minutes late.
0,So I decided to order food from them for lunch for myself and a coworker. The ordering was easy enough and I was told it would be here by 1215 ordered at 1140am... I though sure not a problem... It got here at 1230... After I called to ask what was taking so long. No apologies or nothing... If you say your going to be here at a specific time show up promptly! It's my lunch hour! It was shortened thanks to you and your employees who don't give a damn. 23 bucks for 2 half sandwiches and small salads after tip.. Shoulda ordered something good for this price. I got the turkey sandwich  and it was rather forgettable. I don't think I will be ordering from this establishment again. Shoulda just got in n out.
1,"Size/ambiance wise, this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Weird huh? It just reminds me of my favorite casual neighborhood restaurants/pubs in London, Chicago and San Francisco. \n\nThe first time I went with a girlfriend it was a busy stormy night and we sat at the bar for dinner because we couldn't wait for a table. I ordered fish and chips because I had heard they were voted the best in Charlotte, which is kind of like being voted tallest of the Pygmies. Sorry blokes, the fish 'n chips in the Queen City would not make the Queen happy! So I was hopeful, but they disappointed. Unlike Mike K's experience, my fish wasn't soggy or spot on, mine was over fried and quite hard (3/5). I felt it was a bit over battered and then just left in too long. The chips were great tasting but some were quite greasy and soggy. I would love to go back and have both spot on. But I also had the marscapone & berries crepe which was a revelation (5/5). As great as the bananas foster crepe was, I still actually prefer the marscapone/berry crepe!\n\nThe second time I went I ordered the spinach & wild mushroom +chicken savory crepe and we shared a bananas foster crepe (4/5). The savory crepe was 3.5/5 good but not the best I've ever had (and they pale in comparison to Cafe Monte's savory crepes).  My husband struggled to find an entree (he doesn't like savory crepes) but was healthy, so he went with a pork special, but be forewarned: DON'T GO IF YOU\""RE ON A DIET! Service on food was great and patient (silly hub was in a picky mood) and bar service is slower.\n\nThe last time we went, I got the steak and frites and hubby got the french onion soup and the Crepe Cellar burger complete with onion straws, gruyere and some nice seasoning. Best of all? You can order the burger the temperature you want (in theory) because they grind their own meat in house. I would give the burger 4.5/5 because it came out over done for how he ordered it, but the taste was great without being greasy. He really liked the bun too. French Onion soup was on the sweet side, not too much cheese and was very nice (5/5). My steak was prepared to the right temperature and was a good cut of meat but there was a lot of char on the outside which I had to cut away or accidentally eat and the red wine reduction lacked enough oomph to cover it up. (3/5) Maybe adding a dash of balsamic would have done the trick. Regardless, the frites were more evenly fried and the meal was lovely. Next time I will try mussels or fish special and H will try the baguette pizza.\n\nBottom Line: Go for the sweet crepes. If they got more variety in the entrees in the \""healthy\"" arena, we would be regulars."
1,"I love the spicy eggplant here. Its not super spicy so I add hot mustard, but its way yummy. The eggplant is tender, flavorful and melts in your mouth without being mushy. My friend had the Desert Jade Egg Fu Yung and she said it was amazing. The service is good, quick and efficient. Overall a great place to get your chinese food fix."
1,"This company is OUTSTANDING! I have completely switched dog groomers due to this clean, green mobile grooming staff and services! I have a mini poodle and have found it difficult to find a groomer that can cut his hair without making him look too girly. This place cuts it perfectly! And the best thing..They come to you! You don't even have to leave your house! So, instead of me spending time driving to and from the groomers, all I have to do is open the front door! Also, their prodcuts are clean and organic, so you know everything is safe for your pet. I actually took a peep inside the groomer station today and everything is spotless! The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied with their services. I know my pooch feels clean and so much better afterwards!\n\nAlso, their prices are just like any other groomer! So, for anyone who thinks they may be pricer due to them coming to you, nope, just the same!  Love, love, love!"
0,"Okay it is official NO MORE KC AND SUE!! They sold the business and the new owners the sushi is baaddd. Anyone know if KC and Sue are opening another place??

1,"OK - I admit it - I HATE THE DENTIST!!  So getting me to go to the dentist after ___years, was an adventure for my other half.  (He's been very happy going to Dr. Miller for about 3 years; they met playing adult hockey.)  Dr. Miller talked with my other half spoke about the procedures and first trip was uneventful.  (While Dr. Miller deserves most of the credit - the other half did provide moral support throughout the process!!!)  Xray's, some basic cleaning and Zoom whitening.  I survived, and the staff was so thoughful - they knew I had bad experiences in the past and all checked on me.  Travis was great on the whitening; talking to me through the entire process.  \nTwo weeks later - I went BY MYSELF!  This time, a deep cleaning and three caps/bonds to even out some chipped teeth.  All good - the deep cleaning did not even hurt and I was very apprehensive.  Again, whenever I got a little nervous and needed to take a break; Dr. Miller stopped and let me do so.  He's a very thorough, but thoughful and caring dentist.  The staff is wonderful - Linda, Michael at the reception desk and the office is very modern and clean.  (The massage chairs are nice!)  My teeth look and feel great.  Whenever I mentioned a \""rough spot\""; Dr. Miller polished it out - he did not complain about my sensitivity and the fact that I really needed some extra polishing - I suppose I have a sensitive tongue/mouth.\nI talked to two of my other \""Yelp\"" friends who also did not like the dentist and all are patients of Dr. Miller.  While we all still hate going to the dentist (Basically, we all had bad experiences as kids/young adults.), we all agree that Dr. Miller is THE BEST DENTIST we have gone to.  I'll be back in three months for a regular check-up."
0,"Good atmosphere, average food, but a lot to worry about as far as menu & other policies is concerned.  Food is consistent, bread is above average, and prices are within normal range for Phoenix.\n\nWhy are the traditional appetizers available ONLY on Saturday and Sunday, and ONLY between 12:00 and 6:00?  Vegetable Pakorka, Samosa, Chole Poori, and more... only available on 2 days a week.  Why?  This is crazy.  \n\nClosed Mondays.\n\nCommon to be closed entirely for private parties, or they switch to take-out only because of private parties.\n\nAloo Mattar is a lunch special.  Another dish (eggplant) is a lunch special.  Neither one is on the regular menu, and it is hit and miss with whether or not the evening chef can make them.\n\nThere is little difference between medium, medium hot, and hot.  If you order extra hot (chef's hot) there's a huge jump.  They just can't get it right."
1,"Very good BYOW Italian restaurant located on the waterfront.\n\nFood : very good. Yeah it's Italian food and we see a lot of similar restaurants in this city, but I have never been disappointed (always pleased actually). They make pretty good lamb, as well as home made pesto.\nThere are several other Italian restaurants on the waterfront in Lachine, this one is one of the best in my opinion.\n\nService : nothing short of excellent. Wait staff always tends to you and makes sure you are satisfied.\n\nDecor : very simple, but elegant. Beautiful terrace with stone floor.\n\nI would definitely bring friends here."
0,"I was staying at a hotel about .8 miles away as I was going to the Fiesta Bowl, and I noticed that they had an ad about delivering food to the hotel. Then I started reading the small print. Does not include tip, tax, $3 set up charge, etc. I decided to go there so I called. I told the girl where I was staying, lots of one way streets, etc. and asked for directions from my hotel. Lots of um's and ah's and she then asked me to wait until she got someone else on the phone. I almost hung up and then another dizzy girl picked up and she started stammering and stuttering without any clear directions, until she told me to wait until she got someone else on the phone, and I said, \""never mind\"" and hung up. I went to the front desk at the hotel and the woman there gave me clear directions in about  2 minutes. I was on the phone with the two dingbats for about 15 to 20 minutes. I drove over and it took about 5 minutes to get there. I walked in and the restaurant was packed, so I went into the lounge to see if I could order in there. As I was walking about, I received \""hard\"" looks from the guys on duty there, bouncers I guess. I looked at the jerk, turned around and went to the reception area and asked one of the young ladies how long it would take for a table for one. She said about an hour and a half. I asked her if she was serious and she said \""yes\"", so I left. When I got back to the hotel, I tried to order take out without success. Even though it was before 9PM and the order form said that they delivered up to that time, they said they were not delivering. I gues it was because it was New Years Eve. When I went to the office to look for another restaurant, I met some UConn fans, and as I was talking with them about Bobby Q, they said that Bobby Q wasn't that great when compared to a few CT barbecue places or some Southern places they visited in Charlotte during another bowl game. The famous cornbread did not live up to its rep, so I felt better. Then, they asked if I wanted to try some of their food. They had a bunch of leftovers, that they weren't going to eat, and I had a microwave in my room. Like them, I wasn't impressed with either the food or the famous sauce. More hype than good food, an incompetent wait staff, and nasty looking guys in the lounge does not look like a good time to me. Sorry Bobby Q."
0,"Still no door on that toilet stall in the men's room? Sorry but people do like to poop in privacy. I'd hate this to be the reason why I am down rating this bar, but you'd think it'd be more of a priority for them to fix something as simple as a bathroom stall door. If you don't want to fix this, add a lock to the main door."
0,"I'm not a big fan of Walmart, I prefer Target hands down. It seems like no matter what location I go to they always smell so weird. I have been to this location a few times since moving into the area. Prices are low but so is the quality, you get what you pay for! My last visit here was with my prego friend Mary who needed to pick up a breast pump she ordered online. I was making her a yummy dinner that night so she also got a couple bottles of wine. Check out was a pain in the ass since our cashier was so slow & the old lady in front of us had a million coupons. Regardless of all the negatives, I'm sure I'll be back!"
1,"Love this place! Who would've thought I'd be reviewing a library?\n\nThe building is so cool and modern inside. So many places to lounge, a cafe, an outdoor area to chill, and the best thing of all for me is that there is a huge play area in the children's section! With toys, puzzles, and books galore. I haven't had to buy too many books for my little one (she's 1 now!). Instead, I check out 6 to 8 books per every 4 weeks for her to enjoy and they are all usually in good shape. Plus they have a free baby time class there where we can bring our babies. The instructors are so talented. They sing and read books to our babies. They also bring toys for them to play with. My little girl loves it! And loves to be with the other babies as well. Awesome!"
0,Order a Bacardi and coke...... Except don't expect to get Bacardi rum in your drink. You ask for high level liquor and they give u well liquor
0,"Played black jack.  I put $20 near betting spots, Double Deck, for dealer to change. He dealt right past my money.  I put the money down while he shuffling.\nLeft that table and went to a BJ shoe game.  Deal never smiled or said a word.  Would never play BJ here again.  Got the feeling my business was not, in the least, appreciated.\nWanted to play poker, but it doesn't open till 6pm"
0,"To put it concisely, the food was tiny & weird, though they do get props for excellent decor.\n\nThe place looks nice, there's no denying it. There's an obvious theme going on, low-light interior with candles on every surface, around a dozen and a half ornate chandeliers, crosses on the back wall to tie in with the actual Spanish Mission. It's going for dark & solemn, and it hits the mark, so kudos for that.\n\nThe food, though...I mean, I suppose my group and I should have been prepared for pretentious presentation and ridiculously small portions, given that this is Scottsdale, but seriously, when the food came out, we looked at each other, had a bit of a moment, all clearly baffled by how little we each had on our plates. It tasted alright, and was artfully plated, but still, far too small.\n\nAnd it wasn't only the portions; part of the problem, at least for me personally, was what they tried to pass off as a salad. It was maybe five slivers of onion, a few itty bitty greens, and half a dozen extremely thin-sliced tomatillas. This was all sprinkled over my flat iron steak and repeatedly referred to by the waitress as a salad. It was not a salad. It was a garnish that they tried to talk up as a very fancy salad so they could justify charging $30 for the meal.\n\nMy group and I will not be returning. We're happy to visit our usual Mexican restaurant haunts. But hey, in an attempt to end on a happy note, I'd like to mention that the service was awesome. The hostesses were welcoming, our waters were refilled probably 7 or 8 times, our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and a manager checked on us halfway through the meal.\n\nMaybe we should have told the manager that the food was tiny and weird...oh well."
1,"Located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, The Daily Grind is an awesome coffee emporium all around.\n\nThis coffee shop is about as centrally located as they come.  It is right off the light rail route, not far from the ball parks, very near a lot of paid parking spots and right across the street from Duck and Decanter.\n\nThe Daily Grind won me over from their name.  The double play on words is simple and clever.  Then, being located in the heart of downtown is awesome, as it allows for a lot of foot traffic to observe, not to mention the skyscraper construction.\n\nThe space in this place is spectacular.  They offer plenty of small tables to sit down and plug-in at and the atmosphere is great.   The overwhelming red color inside makes you think for a split second you traveled into some time warp and landed back in 1980's Russia.\n\nI knew I was going to especially like it when I saw they offered complimentary WiFi.  They definitely know how to win a nerd's heart!  I managed to find a perfect table next to a window right next to a plug in...I could see myself sitting here all day inhaling espresso and working on writing projects.  The good music (Dave Matthews is playing as I type this) isn't going to make me want to leave, either.\n\nThis was another selection for Phoenix #OpenCoffee, and I definitely plan on coming back.  They even have a coffee club car (buy 10, get one free)."
1,this pizza hut has the nicest worker who has ever worked at pizza hut. his name is fred and he is awesome. he is usually working at the counter when i pick up my food.\n\neverything else is pretty much what you expect from pizza hut in general.
1,Not on the strip but you can't go wrong with the all-suite rooms! The one and only reason I like to stay at this hotel is for the pool area. That's about it. I think Rio has one of the best pool areas. That's what sets this hotel apart from the hundreds of other choices you have.
1,"Oh. my. god. I am craving this right now as I write this review. As my extent of knowledge about Canada goes (which is very little), nothing is more Canadian than poutine, right?? I definitely had to try this place out before I left Canada. \n\nEven though Poutineville was only half a mile away from our hotel, I was seriously considering if it was worth it having to walk 10 minutes in a snow storm to eat here. I may have gotten a little bit sick, but all I have to say is that I have no regrets. I was never ever a fan of carbs, of cheese, or anything that this place would stand for, but somehow, Poutineville converted me. \n\nI opted for the make-your-own-poutine menu, since I was all about having it my own way. It starts at 8-9 dollars, and you work your way up depending on how much stuff you decide to put in your poutine. From what I can recall, I added mushrooms, hot dog, bell peppers, gravy, runny egg, and some other options that I don't even remember. I ended up with about 10 additional items on top, which totaled up to about $19 just for that one dish. That sounds like a lot, but when the dish was served to us, it all made sense; it was huge!  It was like 2 days worth of food for me and my boyfriend, no way I would be able to finish that in one sitting. After eating through 1/4 of it, we decided to pack it up and enjoy it later.\n\nI wish I was able to explain how good my customized poutine was. Yeah the flavors didn't really match, but I devoured it nevertheless. I especially enjoyed the cheese curds, and I'm not even a fan of cheese. The service was quick and the drink selection was adequate. If I ever find myself in Montreal again, you can almost guarantee that this will be the first place I will stop by at."
1,"I've been to a few Sephoras and this one is solid in terms of selection. However, I'm glad I came in knowing what I wanted to buy because not one sales person asked if I needed help. Maybe I didn't look like I needed help (I didn't) or maybe it was because I was with my husband. Either way, it didn't bother me because I know my way around a Sephora. At the same time, if I had been a novice, I don't think this would have been as positive an experience. The cashiers were very friendly, cool and quick. I'd go back and am glad to know that this one exists."
1,"Not surprised the buzz has started about this place. I've been there twice already and the food is excellent.  Quiet location, neighborhood  feel, friendly and family owned. Afraid to post how yummy everything is because it will be too crowded next time we want to go. The only drawback of this place is that there aren't enough seats, and once word gets around about the homemade bread, robust stromboli, and delicious Bolognese sauce, the line will be out the door all the time."
0,"A hotel well past its prime. It needs a major face lift. It has the feel of an old Holiday Inn, but it's a Hilton. \n\nThe construction is shoddy. The hallway floor changes levels. You can see the joists of the outer walls of the hotel in the elevator lobbies. CLASSY, lemme tell ya. The entire place has that musty hotel smell (I noticed in Las Vegas there are two classes of hotel, those that smell like hotels, and those that don't). The rugs are shoddy. It's far away from everything on the strip. The buffet is GAWD AWFUL.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that whole back wing of the hotel is depressing. The lighting is bad old age home commissary-cum-trailer park/truck stop/diner.  You will be surprised to find that Ken-LRation is not on the menu. It just tastes like  it.\n\nAvoid this hotel unless none of the above bothers you. \n\nOh, and they fleece you left and right. $14.99 PER DAY for wireless with no option for cheaper multi-day plan. \n\nThe more I think about this place, the angrier I get.  STAY AWAY. Two stars is generous."
1,Great shopping close to Main Street and the downtown casinos.  It's also down the road from the Strip and is a great place to while the hours away if you don't gamble. \n\nI shop here twice a year with family and friends as it's pretty affordable.  We split up and shop for a couple of hours then meet at Makino's for AYCE Japanese food and sushi buffet and show each other what we found.   \n\nThis trip my friend found $10 Fossil watches and a $6 long-sleeve t-shirt at The Gap.  I had some luck at the Tumi store this time with 50% off of some of their leather goods and luggage.  \n\nI've never had much luck with the clothes and find it hard to find anything decent.  I've also noticed that some of the stores don't really offer much of a discount.  I've had good luck at the Coach and Cole Haan store where they often have 30% off of their sale prices.  The Le Sports Sac store is extremely overpriced and empty.
0,"I really wanted to like this place as I heard good and bad things about it. Maybe last night they were having a rough time, but alas here is my review.\n\nI met other yelpers here for pre-theater dinner. I will say there were about 20+ of us give or take at various tables. At the larger table of about 12, for some reason they just couldn't seem to get it together. Drink orders got mixed up, food orders came out very late or not all. Yes you read that right, not at all.  It got to the point that we were scrambling to eat the food some of us did receive and pay our bill to get out of there to catch the show. The table across from us, the entire party came in later than we did ( table of 6) and yet they were served there drinks, food, and checks in a very timely fashion. (and yes they were part of our group)\n\nI will say this, the food that we did receive was good and the staff was friendly enough but still it does not make up for the service. The restaurant was not busy and we had reservations so it was not like they didn't know we were coming  which makes this even more puzzling. Maybe I will try again if and when I am downtown and just sit at the bar. Maybe it was the fact that we were a large party, but again the restaurant was not busy. Maybe they were just having an off night."
1,"HELL NO THIS ISN'T A THREE STAR ESTABLISHMENT!!!\n(and I hate exclamation points!)\n\nSeriously, I'm a little mad. \n\nWHO ARE YOU PEOPLE AND WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN EATING? \n\nWith all due respect Edinburgh and the fine and wonderful people I have met here, I have not seen such skewed ratings for places to eat in my life until I came here. \n\nFirst, you rate PIZZA F**KING PARADISE a FOUR STAR and this place you think sucks? I've always said \""The UK gets a bad rap, they have some damn fine food.\"" Well, I'm here to say - you do have damn fine food, you just don't respect it. Clearly it's not the food it's your wrong opinions. (I still love you guys though)\n\nIllegal Jack's is DAMN FINE fast food tex mex. I have eaten in Edinburgh for three weeks at 4 and 5 star Yelp rated places and this was FAR AND AWAY the best meal I had. \n\nThe fresh spicy salsa was out of control awesome. \nNext layer cheddar cheese. \nNext layer AMAZING veggie chili that filled me to the brim. \nNext layer damn fine black beans.\nNext layer Mexican rice. \nHeld in a CRISPY CRISPY DELICIOUS corn tortilla. \n\nAdded layer Guacamole that was... damn fine for some Guacamole served in Scotland. It's a-friggin million miles away from Mexico and they still managed to pull off the guac! Well done Illegal Jack. \n\nADDED BONUS: Buffalo Sauce. For real Edinburgh? You can't respect that there's Buffalo Wings here? I mean where else are you going to get Buffalo Wings? \n\nNow, if you come here expecting MEXICAN food, you won't get it. You know why? Cause BURRITOS are AMERICAN. Yes, I said it. We didn't invent the tortilla, and we didn't invent the bean but we did invent the carrying case. \n\nNB: \nAlmost all edible \""dishes\"" and things that allow you to \""eat and run\"" were invented in the good 'ole US of A. \n\nExhibit \n\nA: Hamburger Bun \nB: Ice Cream Cone \nC: Kabob stick (Yes teriyaki chicken put on a stick in California)\nD: Hot dog Bun \nE: Bread Bowl\n\nIf you have a hankering for food that MOST CERTAINLY DOESN'T SUCK, come one, come all, come here. \n\nThis shit is delicious. Anyone says different - we can take this outside!"
0,"When you read the menu, things sound promising, but nothing I tried ever tasted even half as good as it sounded. \n\nI've tried the veggie burger, the grilled cheese, and the barbecue chicken sandwich (along with maybe one or two specials), and all of them left me feeling mildly queasy. Too much grease? Spices that don't agree with me? I don't know. Even the fries disappointed me. \n\nIn addition to the blah food, I'm still annoyed with their inconsideration as neighbors. I lived above them for a year, and I wanted to smash my head into the wall most nights. Ultra-repetitive music - I swear the only thing their bartenders listened to in 2005/2006 was \""Sweet Caroline\"" (ONCE A NIGHT IS ENOUGH, three made me think about coming in and ripping the speakers down) and The Killers' first album. Also, they routinely left the music on full-blast until 5 am. I expected noise until bar time, but pounding bass til sunrise during the week, not so much. \n\nRanting aside, they get two stars instead of one because the food is edible (not good, but edible) and they can accommodate large groups."
0,"We live nearby and have been here a few times.  My biggest complaint is the music.  Yes, I could pay to play the Juke box, but if no one is playing it, the regular music is a somewhere between headbanging and screeching rock.  I don't mind rock and pop & general alternative music, but the screeching and yelling is annoying to a general audience and one song kept dropping the \""F\"" bomb with children in the place.  Most in the immediate vicinity are in the 40+ crowd, they need to embrace this fact or they will loose their locals.  Food is average.  Menu changes occasionally.  The last 3 times I ordered the Strawberry and Blue Salad and they have not had strawberries each time.  HELLO it is summer getting fresh strawberries at the grocery store in the same parking lot would take 5 minutes or less.\nBetween two of us, appetizer, meal and a few drinks we spend close to $50 plus tip.  Just play some music that can be appreciated by a general audience at all times and keep the menus current with what you plan to serve.  I do understand that occasionally you may run out of something, but 3 weeks in a row?"

0,"So, about three minutes after I posted this, the phone rang. It was Lisa from the Improv. I think it's coincidence, but she was calling to ask about last night. It was clear that she knew that some guests had a problem. She apologized and offered comps for any upcoming show. That means a lot and we will take her up on it. \n\n- - - - - -\n\nNot such a great experience at the Improv last night. I took the lady for the Valentines package of three course dinner and the show. I'll say that the show was excellent, and we specifically went to see Taylor Williamson. \n\nFirst, parking is a nightmare. It anyways has been there on weekends. Arrive early is the only solution. \n\nThe cub is completely remodeled and looks great. They refinished everything, with barn board all over, new lighting and plumbing  fixtures, and nice decor. New sound and lights, too. \n\nProblem was with the service, we were seated about a half hour early and really expected dinner to start coming. The server took the drink order, and they came quickly enough, but never an offer to refill my soda. The salad came during the opener, and this was a sad, pathetic little excuse for a salad. The entree, however came about an hour later, during the headliner's set. Many of the guests in our section turned it down, while my lady got hers to go and I choked mine down. The cake never came. \n\nI don't understand why it took so long to serve us and why the food came during the headline act. First, my attention was taken away from the show, but what disrespect to the headliner.  My section was directly in front of the stage and I know that he could see us, after all, he talked to me and the people around us several times. \n\nOh, food? Overlooked Mahi and wet rice. I already mentioned the 1/4 cup of salad. This was $100 for two of us, but did include admission."
1,I've had sushi from all over and Blue Wasabi is my favorite spot. Wish I had one close to where I live now. Any of the rolls are great and service is always top notch. \n\nSmall recommendation - sit outside. The lighting is a bit dark inside.
0,"Our server was pretty slow. And, we never got our change back. Shame"
0,"Walked in with a party of four, stood at the front for 10 minutes. They were clearly understaffed. We had a coupon from Amazon that gave no clear distinction that it couldn't be used for lunch specials. When they told us we only could order from the regular menu we were ok. Now we weren't trying to nickel and dime them, but we asked if we would be allowed to use ALL of our coupon for 3 people's meal, which would have taken care of their bill a little, and then a separate check for their lunch menu. They said because we were at the same table we couldn't do that. Which is ridiculous if you're doing separate checks. The waitress didn't know what some items on the menu were. We were treated very poorly from the start and whatever policies there was no apology for executing them or discussion. We were treated like idiots"
1,"THE BEST BURGERS AND FRIES EVER! Everthing I have tried from here is amazing. The 4 stars would be a 5 if I didn't have to stand in line (outside) to wait for a table, then stand in line to order cafeteria style at the bar AND again for food, then have a server get me a soda refill and leave me feeling like I am supposed to leave a tip. If this place offered a comfertable place to sit while waiting and table service it would be a 5 star for sure."

1,"Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has their own yelp page so why not North?! Found it unfair that they had one but NLV didn't so decided to create it for them!\n\nEach city has obviously faced some tough economic times. On that note, it has taken a serious toll on this city. And as statistics have proven, because of the economic pressure, crime rates have gone up. Making these officers busier and at the same time, facing some serious budget cuts. Cuts not only puts innocent and honest officers out of jobs, but it also makes the community far more dangerous and puts these officers in more imminent danger since they can be outnumbered. \n\nI got the opportunity to volunteer with NLVPD and be a part of their Citizen's Academy. It was truly a enriching experience. I got to meet a lot of officers who specialize in different fields such as narcotics, K9, homicide detectives, and SWAT. They all shared their experiences and taught us a brief overview of their expertise. Boy is there a lot more than what the media displays. The kind of pressure they have is so unappreciated and undermined. \n\nBeing a part of NLVPD's Citizen's Academy also allowed me to do a 10 hour ride along with their officers, in which I got to follow an officer do his duty throughout the day. And I got to wear a Kevlar vest! Nevertheless, a very rewarding experience. I got to experience real life crimes ranging from domestics to stabbing. (Yes with a knife). Even had to witness a fatal auto-pedestrian accident. By the time the officer and I reached the hospital, they put the sheet over him, which means that he had died. I was fortunate enough to experience an unfortunate event. Only to humble me and teach me that life can end that quickly.\n\nOther than my rewarding experiences, these officers deserve just as much as credit as Metro has received. The amount of pressure they have to patrol a city that is similar to South Central, yet, a greedy city manager that's breathing down their necks to cut officers and cut their pension, only for the manager himself to maintain his outrageous benefits. Don't believe what the media says and respect the men who are putting their lives on the line just to ensure the safety of a mightily struggling community."
0,"We came here based on Yelp reviews, and the fact that we were staying at the Bellagio resort. We made a reservation with the concierge and were accomodated for an 8:30 sitting. We were escorted to the table and thought the room looked nice albeit dark. We sat down and started to chat but could hardly hear each other. The restaurant was very busy and the noise was down to the full house as well as the hard walls and tile floor. The hostess gave us two menus and an ipad. No explanation but basically figured the ipad was the wine list and menu pics etc. the server checked in and asked if we would like to start with some wine, I said that we werent sure what we were going to eat so would need some time before our wine choice. BIG MISTAKE, at least 20 minutes passed before we saw him again, we were on minute three of our 5 minute countdown to walking out. We ordered the carpaccio, the mushroom tagliatelle and the gnocci and a bottle of Layer Cake. The carpaccio arrived and it was as advertised, delicious. We also got some tappenade but I just don't get the white chocolate scone as an accompanyment. We again waited for what seemed a very long time for the remnants of the carpaccio to be taken away. And then we waited, and waited. the table next to us who came in while we were ordering recieved their appy and entree and were deciding about desert while our server announced that the kitchen would be plating our pasta momentarily. I would have complained directly to this guy but he was a ghost. A different person was continually dropping off our food or refilling our water. Once the pasta arrived , the gnocci was fine, nothing special, and the mushroom pasta was well over cooked, mushy and stuck together, at the quality check we actually mentioned that its was just Ok, but no reaction. Bottome line? don't bother"
1,"I am an Arizona native with four kids and LOVE Schnepf Farms.  My oldest son is 20 and we have been bringing our kids to this farm every October since he was four years old.  My 17 year old twins and 13 year old have been going their since they were born.  It is a wonderful family experience and tradition.  It is always exciting to see what new things they add each year.  Last year my husband and teenagers went on the roller coaster about 8 times.  This year my twins are working at the farm learning working skills, customer service and teamwork.  How wonderful that the owners give back to the community in which their farm resides.  It is sad that there are complaints about the cost, this is the only time of year there is an admission fee and entertainment always has a price.  Arizona in October has beautiful weather and adults and children alike can enjoy the walks, food, entertainment and other things to do.  Lots of fun activities for children and adults.  How wonderful to have a local operating farm in our area.  As our children grow and grandchildren are born, I can't wait to continue the tradition with them.  Thank you Carrie Schnepf and family for this gem in Queen Creek.  We are grateful for your contributions."
0,This place used to be great but not anymore ...kitchen is really really slow took us 50 min to get a simple cheese pizza .. Waiter was terrible and not smile no urgency .. Never going back this POS \n\nStay away from this pizza place there are plenty other good ones in phoenix to go to
0,"I agree, worst customer service ever!! I dropped my bike's off on a Friday and told them I would pick it up in a week. I stopped in on the following Saturday and the bike was not ready. I was told if I came in later that afternoon it would be ready. I told them it could wait until Sunday so I left. When I returned on Sunday it hadn't even been touched. They claimed they were still waiting for parts!! I collected the two bikes and got out of there as quick as I could. I was planning on buying a cruiser there also, not in a million years after that experience."
1,Good strong drinks!  That is all and that makes me a fan.  A total dive.  Not that there is anything wrong with that.
0,DONT GET THE RIBEYE.  Decided to try the special which has been posted on the outside of the restaurant for several  weeks which was the 12oz ribeye steak.  I don't think I've had anything  as bad steakwise since ponderosa closed.  The texture of the meat was spongy and there was so much gristle it was difficult to cut.  The only discernable flavor was a slight smokey taste.  It was truly terrible.
0,"What a difference two years make. We were up in Scottsdale and decided to treat ourselves to The Grind. We were really looking forward to the burgers as we had such a great experience the first time. This experience: the service started out great, attentive and helpful. We had a long discussion about ordering medium or medium rare. We both ordered the Peppercorn burgers medium rare and our boy's burgers medium. Sweet potatoes, onion rings and scalloped potatoes. \n\nThe burgers came out, beautiful presentation, I cut it in half and it's gray from top to bottom. Not one bit of pink. Oh well. I'm thinking it's still going to be good. Take a bite and not very good. After a couple of bites I'm wondering if the kitchen did us a favor by overcooking the meat. All four of our burgers were cooked the same. The waiter never returned to ask how our meal was. After waiting about 15 minutes with complete avoidance by the waiter I told the bartender that the meat was very over-cooked. She offered to have another made but we were done. The fries were great and the potatoes were wonderful. The waiter finally returned to give us a free order of their donuts. They were delicious but didn't make up for $45 worth of unappetizing burgers. \n\nOur bill was $80 we ate only \u00bc of each burger, even the kid sized burger. I'm fairly certain it will be at least another two years before we return."

1,"Orange Beef, best thing on the menu. We love this place. Many a birthday has been spent here. Great service, very friendly place."
0,"Would be a great place if adults didn't have to pay, since they can't do anything anyway.  Followed and watched the kids to their thing and it was $11/person.  Adults should be free or 1/2 price.  I looked at it as $44 for 4 of us, 2 are the only ones who really participated, so $22 per child was way too much for what they had.  Noodle room and the fort were the best things there, other than that, wasn't a whole lot for kids who are older."
0,"Unfortunately Daily Dose has decided to start using cheaper ingredients and has really gone downhill.  They changed their house made turkey sausage for the worse (tastes overcooked, old, frozen) the last 3 times I have been in, so it has not been a 1 time thing.  Last few times have been disappointing, which is a shame as this was once a great breakfast place.  With so many other good options close by, I do not believe we will be making another return visit"
0,"Take a cab. First the manager was an ass. He was standing in the way talking to another employee and blocking the woman who was trying to help me. When I said excuse me and tried to get around he looked at me like I was the crazy one. After I stood for nearly 45 minutes to get one of the two shuttles out front to load up and leave. Regardless that there was a line of 50 or more people, they only load a shuttle when they have an exact number of riders to specific hotels. When I finally left I was the last one off and dropped off a couple blocks from my hotel and expected to walk with all my luggage. A cab would have only been about $5 more gotten me to my destination much faster."
0,"I had never had Korean prior to this visit, but am open to all types of delicious food so my 2-stars is not due to being a picky eater. I went with a group of people from work, including someone from Korea who says this is the best he can find in Charlotte (and that, while authentic, it doesn't compare to NYC's options). This place is off Independence, tucked away behind a bigger shopping mall. The inside is open and clean and I was reassured to see a good sanitation rating (99.0). \n\nMy Korean friend ordered us a ton of different things, so I don't know what they were called, but...let's see. My favorites: the Korean BBQ, the pork BBQ, the sweet potatoes covered in honey, the bean curd soup, and the kimchi pancake. I will admit that a lot of the food was quite salty (and other Yelpers have complained about this, too). Do NOT go here if you're a vegetarian."
0,"OnTrac marked the shipment as delivered 5 days after I wrote this review...no package was in sight, and I was home all day that day! These people must have either lost my package or delivered it to the wrong place and figured I wouldn't notice. I called and complained to Amazon. Luckily, they sent a replacement package via UPS. I received it the next business day. Ontrac employees are a bunch of LIARS. Do not deal with them!"
1,Tried this place while waiting for my iPhone to get fixed. Holy moly! Awesome food! We had the lobster bisque and calamari and I can definitely say that it was one of the best lunches I have had in a long time! We will be back!

0,"I scheduled 2 facials and 2 massages a week in advance as I was having company and we were going to have a ladies day out.  We arrived 15 min early for our 1000 appts, no one was there when we arrived.  I called but wasn't impressed with the response.  I felt bad when one gal showed up at 1005 to learn we had appointments, she said she hadn't been told.  We ended up restructuring the rest of our day hoping to still have our services.  We exchanged a few calls as she said she would try to find someone. We did not get our services and I will not go back nor recommend anyone else go there."
0,"Like the other reviewers, we have had a horrible time trying to make an appointment.  After complaining to Groupon, we were able to finally set an appointment.  What a surprise, they never showed up!    Maybe the common theme is, crappy service for Groupon customers?"
0,"We were comped $40 dollars to this restaurant so we figured we would try it out.\n\nI ordered steak nachos and my husband ordered the fajita combo with the steak, chicken, and shrimp. The chips and salsa before the meal were okay. The chips tasted like they came straight out of a bag and the salsa was just mediocre. My nachos were okay. The cheese they use was amazing, the jalapenos were good, but everything else was gross. The steak was so bland, it literally had no flavor at all.\nMy husband's fajitas were the same way. The rice was very bland but the veggies that came with the fajitas were very good. \n\nThis place is just stupid overpriced. My husband's fajitas were so tiny and my nachos weren't all that big. With the two meals, a soda for me and a beer for my husband, the bill came out to be around $45. Staff wasn't very friendly either."
0,I ordered the sashimi and it was the worst sushi I have ever had. The fish did not taste fresh and was served in a bowl which I found rather strange. Over all terrible. I will not be getting sushi here again.
1,"I couldn't be more pleased with my experience with Dr. Mar and her staff.  Honestly, I'm blind as a bat.  The most memorable part of my testing is that I didn't have to have my eyes dilated.  Why?  Because this place has every piece of modern technology known to man.\n\nMy examination was like an assembly line, moving from one machine to the next.  Quick and efficient, which is really important to me.\n\nEric, Dr. Mar's assistant, was terrific.  Personable, warm and friendly (which is hard for some to do at 9:15am) and informative (not just someone operating a machine.)\n\nDr. Mar herself?  She's wonderful.  Soft spoken, obviously well-educated and she gave me some great options regarding my lens choices (which I didn't realize I had.)\n\nMy wife is bugging me to get a pair of glasses to wear instead of my lenses.  Because of my bad eyesight, the strength of my lenses make my eyes so small I look like a rat.  After telling this to Dr. Mar, she completely agreed and said any glasses I got couldn't take that effect away.\n\nIn my opinion, most doctors wouldn't even comment and if they did, they'd be trying to sell me a pair of glasses and downplay my concerns.  Dr. Mar gets extra points for honesty and putting the patient's needs first.\n\nThe fact that the store is in my neighborhood gets the fifth star.  I'm all about convenience.  When I do business with someone, I want to be treated like a person, not a number.  That's exactly my experience with Dr. Mar and her staff.  Great job!"
0,"My husband and I went a few weeks ago. We just moved here and are in search for a great place for pad Thai. Needless to say, this is not the place. My husband commented in how it smelt like cat food- and he was right. The sushi deserves about 3 stars. Average at best. Sadly, we will continue our search..... The staff was very nice (that is why they are getting the extra star)."
1,"Ugly Cakes Bakery's sweet treats are to die for.  I am a sucker for sweets...but not just any sweets.  I know what's good and what isn't.  The minute I tried the Carrot Cake I thought I died and went to heaven.  But it didn't end there.  Then I tried some cookies...and then some fudge...and 'tis the season for Pumpkin Rolls!!! I wanted to cry when I ran out.  \n\nSeriously -- not only are the treats amazing and baked with some major TLC, the souls behind the company are treasures themselves.  Awesome branding, awesome concepts, awesome food, awesome people.  \n\nHighly recommend them to anyone -- even if you dont think you like sweets, you'll like theirs.  I promise!!!!!!"
0,"I am going to get right to the point...they have some cool stuff for sale at good prices...hence 2 stars. Otherwise, their customer service is ghetto and sucks!!! What a shame!!!!!! End of story!!!!!!!!!"

She looked a littel like Julie Bowen who is MILF\nThe food was good too!"
0,"I'm from the North and love a cheese steak so thought this would be perfect since it's right near my home.  Unfortunately, either the staff is underpaid, under-trained, or both, because the service has been AWFUL every time I've gone there.  They are consistently under-staffed and the ordering process makes no sense (and is rarely followed b/c of the under-staffing).\n\nI managed 3 restaurants in my past life and understand the need to keep labor costs down but not at the expense of your livelihood / restaurant future.  \n\nUnless they make some large scale changes I've made my last visit to Penn Station."
0,Long wait (30 minutes) for a bowl of lobster bisque - and then when I finally received my order it was tasteless and watery. I should have ordered something else instead.
1,"For 25 years I refused to stop in Las Vegas.  Then I read about the vegan options at all the Wynn/Encore restaurants - and decided to make a special stop during a recent vacation in the Southwestern US.   The Terrace Point was the first Wynn/Encore restaurant I tried, during a quick lunch stop at the beginning of my vacation.  The reviews I'd read before departure did not lie - this is a tasteful casino; the vegan food is outstanding, and all the staff enthusiastically promote it.  I liked it so much I decided to stop back at the Wynn/Encore complex for a night (and two more meals) on the way back home at the end of my vacation. Will definitely make this a destination, not just a stopover, for future vacations!"
0,"We went back a second time because we thought the poor service and food was just a fluke. However, the waitress & hostess attitudes were still just as nasty as the food."
1,"Great place to eat. We did order quite a few dishes - Mussels, crab cakes, dip, scallops, steak and chocolate mousse. Mussels by far was the best. Steak was not the best as it was over cooked.\n\nWill definitely go back. I am sure the outside sitting in summer would be great."
1,"A couple of times in the last month I have gone here for lunch.  The fry bread here is very, very, good.  I love the crisp, brown, bubbly surface that makes these so addicting.  Both times the fry bread was served so hot I had to let it sit a couple of minutes before eating.\n\nI had the red chili the first time and green the next.  They are both excellent but I really enjoyed the flavor of the hatch green chili in the green.  The beef itself is fall apart tender and quite flavorful in all those juices.  There is also a very nice, but not too spicy, hot sauce that enhances the flavor of the tacos.  Either way, there was so much filling in the fry bread I could only finish part with my hands.  Good thing there are plenty of paper towels!  Next time I hope to leave room for a honey topped fry bread for dessert and then drive immediately to the hospital before going home.\n\nThe ladies that work there are very quiet but nice.  You order at the counter and the food is brought out to you.  The decor is definitely no frills..but hey...this is fry bread not prime rib. \n\nLastly, I really want to make this part of my bi-weekly restaurant rotation but I doubt I'd live to provide an update to this review.  What a way to go though!!!!"
0,"Expensive, and bad. Sorry, but the dogs were rubbery and the chili just didn't do it for me. The \""Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe\"" out in the burbs blows this place away!"
0,"**Grouponers** \ndont buy one or get your money back asap. not worth it. the food is good but service is horrible, not because you have a groupon but because management doesnt know a thing\n\nthe food endline was delicious.....the service, horrible!!! worst i ever had in my life. The owner (STEVE) mentioned to another table they had just bought the restaurant a month ago(but dont worry they still have the same chef) and they were transitioning and getting drink menus blah blah blah. \n\nWe came in a little after 4pm on a tuesday. There was two tables seated. and nobody to acknowledge we were standing in the front waiting to be seated. finally a man saw us and had us sit down after about 7 mins. gave us our menus and thats it. 5 minutes later another waiter comes in and serves us water. about 10 minutes later steve(the owner) comes and if we wanted drinks. we said no but wanted to order our food. i ordered the yellow curry with seafood mix and my wife the pad thai with the deep fried pork appetizer. \n\n25 minutes later nothing. finally steve comes out stating the system was down and he was just putting in the orders....he wrote it down why not manually tell the cooks about the food right. well we waited a little longer and the appetizer came out. it was really good plus an extra appetizer of spring rolls on the house all good.\n\nit took quite another while and finally got our food at about 5:20 pm. well my wife did they forgot about mine. they later brought it with no spice at all. they brought on the side but not spicy. i gotta be honest the food was fantastic but the service horrible. they gave us free appetizer and 15% off our bill but didnt make up for the horrible wait time. another table left after just getting water because no body acknowledge them after that or told them anything. i felt bad for them.\n\nendline:\nwe had 2 hours in the restaurant with headaches at the end. food was good but not worth the wait."
1,"HALO-HALO CHALLENGE 2013 - Contender #9\n\n\""This is our very own.\"" \nThat's what the name of this restaurant, Ito'y Sariling Atin, means.  I know because I asked my mom, who was born and raised in the Philippines, unlike me, who was born in Akron, OH, raised in Cerritos, CA, and have parents who didn't teach me Tagalog.  Now you know, too.\n\nAs the Halo-Halo Challenge winds down, contender #9 brought us to yet another Filipino fast food place that we've never visited.  One thing Mel and I have learned in this short period of time doing the challenge is that Las Vegas has A LOT of Filipino food restaurants.  We're only going to review ten of them for this go-round, but there are still many beyond that number.  ISA is a \""turo-turo\"" style place where you \""point-point\"" at the food you want, just like those other places where you line up at the counter and can get two or three-item combos with rice. We didn't have any food, but I thought I'd let you know in case you want to eat here.\nWe didn't see halo-halo on the menu, but just ordered it anyway, knowing that they did offer it. The lady behind the counter starting speaking to Mel in Tagalog--uh oh.  When this happens and you don't understand what's being said, you just keep answering in English.  She got the message and finally told us that it would take ten minutes.  Oh, okay.  The price here is $5.25 for the icy dessert and theirs had:\n\nUbe ice cream, kaong, azuki, one piece of leche flan, nata de coco, white beans, jam, and chunky ice, again.  What's with the chunky ice?  Challenger #7 also had chunky ice.  I am not a fan of little icebergs in my bowl that I need to stab with my plastic spoon.  \nNo macapuno, langka, ube, or pinipig in this version.\nOther than the chunky ice, this halo-halo is not too shabby.  It's only missing a couple of ingredients that I prefer to make it one of my favorites so far.

1,"So my company catered in NYPD today. They delivered pizzas, wings and salad. \n\nThe wings were good. Still hot, good amount of sauce and crispy skin. The pizza was good but had too much grease. They are large slices so the grease just pools up, making it unappetizing. Overall, the flavor was very good, with just the right seasonings, tasty sauce (could've used a bit more sauce tho) and good cheese. Again, very greasy tho. I'll try it again and see if ordering directly works out better."
1,"Give me some of that \""peanut butta sauce\""\n\nYou probably don't want this if you're not drunk, but otherwise, c'mon I don't care if it sounds gross to you, no one I know doesn't think this shit is delicious once they've tried it. Withhold your reservations, don't be a snob. Just ask to have some of that warm PB poured all over those greasy fried noodles then squirt some Sriracha and Soya sauce on it. Sounds good, no? That'll be 2 bucks."
0,"Went here for a workday lunch, waited over an hour for food and finally told them we'd just take it to-go.  They were very apologetic, comped everything.  Got back to the office and realized that they had messed up my order.  Two chile rellenos instead of the chile relleno and tamale.  The relleno was filled with runny cheese, no meat, and was awful.  Hate to write negative reviews, but this one seems deserved."
1,"Great pizza, albeit a little overpriced.  They are a little stingy where they charge full price even if you get the toppings on half of the pizza.  Whatever, they make a damn good pizza. With that perfectly crisped thin crust and good portion of toppings.\n\nThe service is a little slow, and the pizza does a take a bit, but it is all worth it.  Also a good place to cougar watch, for some reason they love this place!"
0,"I don't like businesses that scam people.  And I especially don't like businesses that scam my mother... literally.  My mom went in for the advertised \""$29 cleaning & x-ray\"".  What she came out with was an x-ray and a bill quoting $3449 for deep cleaning, flouride varnish, oral irrigation, and lots of other nonsense.\n\nHere's an idea: why not advertise correctly and give your customers what they think they are getting?  Quoting someone a price for a cleaning, sending them out without a cleaning and instead with an insanely high bill is so unethical.  Stop preying on people without health insurance.  Start doing what you say you will do."
1,"As a beginner/novice dancer, I am usually intimidated by the social dances that I go to. So much that I sometimes just stand in the corner and watch. At the Stomp I went to (well, it was actually my first time at the event!) this month, I did not feel out of place very much and had an enjoyable time.\n\nStomp is a monthly themed event for the (swing/lindy) dancing community. Dressing up is encouraged. There is usually a lesson prior to the actual dance. The dancing area is large and spacious enough, with tables and chairs surrounding the hardwood floor for people to sit and relax. Music is \""swing only!\"" and ranges from a variety of eras.\n\nIf I had a suggestion, it would be for them to advertise more. For instance, I only found out about the guest instructor workshops that occurred during this month's event only a few hours before the workshop from a friend. Unfortunately too late for me as I had plans that afternoon, plus I did not know if it was \""beginner friendly\"".\n\nPS You can find more updated (better?) info on Stomp at their FB page: https://www.facebook.com/SaturdayNightStomp"

0,"This place is definitely mediocre and I agree with all the reviews  that deem this little hole in the wall 'overpriced,' because it really is. I ventured over to this spot last night for a quick bite to eat--I was craving spicy salmon rolls like you wouldn't even believe--and I left feeling unsatisfied. Firstly, $6.75 for a spicy salmon roll (with 5 dinky pieces) is really unacceptable. I mean I don't even think it was made fresh and it was not (I repeat, not) spicy in the least bit. Although I must admit the Chicken teriyaki was good--fresh vegetables, delicious sauce--I feel that you could get the same thing at a food court in a mall somewhere. Hell, even 'Teriyaki experience' at Centre Eaton serves up a good teriyaki stir-fry.\n\nThe service was bizarre. The waitress did not speak a word to me--from the moment I  walked in (she motioned me to an open table) to the time I left, it was mostly grunts and head nodding. I usually go out of my way to say 'oh, thanks' or 'how are you,' but it would have been like talking to a brick wall with this one. She was a piece of work. \n\nThe decore is very mundane. Its basically like title flooring with a splash of this nasty blue paint on the walls. The tables are wobbly and the chairs are IKEA. Nothing wrong with IKEA but for $25 for one roll and a teriyaki I expect at least a little effort on presentation. I should've known--if there are only two other diners in the joint at 6 pm its probably not where you want to spend your precious sushi dollars. \n\nEven Sushi Crescent--an AYCE place--was infinitely better in taste, price, and quantity. Go figure!"
0,"Find another loan officer, quickly.\n\nMy loan officer not only was condescending and rude (at lunch I'd have her on speakerphone so I had witnesses to her attitude, her interruptions, and her inconsistencies), but forgot several key elements that held up my close.  She did not order the appraiser who mandated repairs be made to come back, she never let me know the charges of the appraisals until after my card was charged without my permission, she sent me to the underwriter without ever reading the report that stated that several documents were missing and then blamed it on someone else, then finally was so rude with me I hung up on her, called my realtor, and told him if she contacted me again I was reporting her to the board.\n\nToday, I get notice that my homeowner's policy she arranged with an insurance company CANCELED my policy (a condition of my mortgage) and is sending me the refund of the difference.  Apparently my loan officer dropped that ball, too.\n\nI was told several times that without her, I'd be \""dead in the water\"" due to a bankruptcy eight years ago and a late student loan payment four years after that (due to a divorce and frozen assets), and that without her, I wouldn't have a loan.  Odd--I then talked to two other loan officers at two other places who couldnt understand why the loan officer had me pay $30 for court docs NONE of them needed b/c it was EIGHT years ago, and after seven, no one really looks at it.  \n\nShe was incompetent, I still continue to have to deal with the pieces from her dropping the ball, she was rude, she cost me money and time.  Oh--and even after the delay of escrow, where I did not get occupancy, guess who didn't adjust the interest??  You guessed it.  When your realtor has to go down to the office to try to fix things, you know you have a bad deal.  \n\nGo elsewhere. Anywhere."
0,"The buffet lines were too long, so I ended up here with 5 friends all looking to get rowdy.  Despite the scores of 5- to 8-year-olds, we had a good time.  At the end of our meal, I sent a chocolate volcano dessert to the neighboring table of kids with matching soccer shirts on.  It looked really good and probably should have ordered it for us too.  When it came out and the servers sang happy birthday (would have been a total coincidence if it was one of their birthdays!), the kids went from being completely confused to being stoked to dig in the chocolate tower.\n\nI had the bacon burger, which was recommended by our server.  She asked how I wanted it cooked.  I requested medium rare, but it was a little more cooked than medium.  It wasn't impressive, especially for being the best item on the menu.\n\nI drank two $16 very weak fruit punches.  Not impressed here either, since they were so weak.  \n\nEven as a grown (mostly) adult, I was taken by the atmosphere.  The tropical rain forest motif and salt water aquariums were pretty awesome."
0,"Yeah, just as the rating goes, I HAVE had better.\n\nthis was our second day of Vegas and we needed a meal that would digest quickly before we hit the buffets.\n\nIt was actually pretty pricey for what they served. \n\nof course mom always makes the better pho but go across the street and you can get much better pho.\n\nHowever, it reminded me of ghetto little saigon like it REALLY is. haha\n\n\ngo across the street. for sure."
1,"The teppanyaki here is awesome! Everything was delicious, the service was fast & or chef was really great! Will definitely be going back."
1,"Not ooc, but definitely Mexican food as it should be: inexpensive and delicious. Tried all four of their rolled tacos [chicken, steak, two diff types of pork] which were exactly what you'd expect from your prototypical place. There was very friendly service and they were quite prompt.  Luckily we missed out on the lunch rush, as it was Tuesday Taco Day [rolled tacos for $1] when we happened to arrive. The chicken chimi was the hero for the day, far surpassing the four different tacos we tried. Two house salsas available [green and red] that were good but not great. I'd definitely eat here again, but it isn't memorable enough to bring me in from out of the city"
0,"Good food, terrible service. The food was good and in reasonable portions but I hardly ever saw my waiter. It wasn't that they were busy; there were two large tables that were all Asian that got seen constantly without any trouble. After they took my plate away I waited 15min for my check, in that time both tables entered, got seated and ordered their food by the same waiter. It was the first time I've ever not left a tip because I was genuinely offended at their service. Quality wise I'd order take out next time but on principle I'll never give them business again."
1,"Listen, this is THE BEST italian restaurant. Ever. Ive been to many italian restaurants and it's my first time here, Very welcoming staff (I think it was the owner) It was my friends birthday so I reserved and the guy over the phone told me he'd take care of everything. We had mixed salad and penne-perfection. Cocktails, Then dessert with a sparkling candle for my girl's birthday. It looked like chocolat lava  or something and ice cream on the side..THANK U!"
1,Veggie House is great for vegetarians and meat eaters too.  I've been veganish for a year and have been looking for a place like this for a long time.  The Szechuan shrimp I had was not exactly like scallop yet tasted satisfying.  The fried vegan ice cream desert is beyond dreamy..  Will be trying other dishes on the menu pretty soon.

0,"Well, I've been here twice. Their beer list is lacking, but their food is pretty good (get pretzel and stay away from kale), but services is spotty. I was at bar watching game and bartender turned it for her friends. Was very annoying because that is why I went there. So I paid for my 1 drink and went to RandR and spent $100. Just stupid business practices. I don't foresee them making it. Good place for a beer and pretzel but no more."

I loved that when we walked in all the arcade games were shut off and didn't work....probably because our round of mini golf only costed $12 for the 2 of us. We proceeded to the course which was a total joke. The turf was totally beat up, the staging and props looked condemned, and at one point I smelt something that resembled a dead body or animal. At one point I bet this was a nice place but the ponds that went thru the course were all dried up and not working and everything was a mess! It wasn't enjoyable and we were very disappointed, Spend the extra couple dollars and go to crackerjax or castle n coasters."
1,"Palms is definitely a unique resort that is unlike any other.  The Vegas resort caters to the young and happening crowd of Vegas.  The Maloof brothers strategically built a fine resort that caters to the hardcore party goers of Sin City.  The Palms has a number of signature bars, clubs, and parties that have made them infamous around the globe.  Among those being Ditch Friday's, Ghost Bar, Playboy Club and the Hugh Hefner Villas located at the top of the Palms.\n\nI'm not a huge club goer, actually, I'm not a club goer at all.  Consequently, my review focuses more on the amenities and services that the Palms offers its guests.  I recently received a comp'd stay at the Palms and took full advantage of it.  The comp'd stay included $100 dining credit at Steak 9 Steakhouse, a cabana at their pool, a slot credit, and three nights on the house.  I checked in quite early and thought it might be a problem; however, I was surprised my room was already ready at 9 a.m.  \n\nI checked in and the service representative seemed to be in a mood.  She didn't explain how to get to my room and I had to ask a security officer, who lead me to the elevators.  I headed to the eleventh floor and as I entered the key card, I imagined a room similar to the Wynn or Encore.  I opened the door and I was a little disappointed in the size, quality, and value.  However, the view was spectacular as I had a glorious view of their infamous pool, which looked amazing.\n\nThe room was a standard deluxe that included two beds, a desk, TV, clock, radio, and a private bathroom.  I was expecting a four star room but instead was a three star room.  As I looked through the welcome envelope, I didn't see any of the credits that I was offered in the mail.  Regardless, I wasn't about to complain and ask where's my free stuff.  I was happy enough with a free room at a four star resort.  \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the resort and was happy with my stay, but I was a little disappointed in not trying out the steak house, slots, and cabana as I was originally promised.  As I checked out on Sunday, I headed down to the front desk and asked if I owed anything.  As the woman looked over my account, she asked me why I didn't use my food credit, slot credit, cabana credit, and why i was leaving a day early!!  I replied that I wasn't offered any of those services when I checked in.  She apologized for the lack of communication and did her best to treat me the best she could.  I was extremely disappointed that the service representative that checked me in FAILED to acknowledge all of my complimentary credits and services.  Unfortunately, I had to be back home the next day and could not take advantage of the added day or resort services.\n\nA few days later, I received an email from quality control and they apologized for the inconveniences I experienced at check it.  I thought it was kind of them that a person sent a personalized letter apologizing for the incident.  As a result, I still believe the Palms is an amazing resort and is worthy of four stars."
1,"Wife and I were on vacation in Vegas. We come here every year. We do lots of eating, lots of gambling, lots of partying, and of course lots of sleeping.\n\nWe always stay at the M GM.  While walking through their restaurant and food court area on the ground level, we noticed that the Mexican restaurant called Diego's was no longer there. In its place, was another Mexican restaurant called Hecho en Vegas. \n\nNow, usually when I see a restaurant replaced by a similar restaurant, it kind of is a turn off. It seems like they replaced apples with apples.  \n\nWe had been to the now defunct Diego's before, and it wasn't that great. It was overpriced, under portioned, and they never actually seemed to be open to serve their full menu. It was always happy hour appetizers pretty much every time we tried to go there.\n\nWe decided to give this new place a chance, hoping that it was completely different from the original Diego's.  Believe me, it definitely was. The service was excellent, our waitress knew the menu very well, and the food came out fairly quickly.\n\n Instantly, I noticed that this was not your traditional Mexican food. It wasn't super greasy, it wasn't super salty, and it wasn't heavy-handed with the seasoning. Everything was very delicate and almost seemed sort of like a Mexican version of fine dining cuisine.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised. I got steak tacos with some side dishes, and the wife got a steak Mexican salad and also had some appetizers. Everything was fresh and tasty.\n\nIt was a bit on the pricey side, but that is pretty much what you can expect when you're eating in one of the major resorts on the strip. We felt that our food was so good that it was worth every penny.\n\nBangin' food. Can't go wrong with Hecho en Vegas."
0,"idk...i've gotta say, i've had far better pizza than this.  i too was excited to try this place based on the reviews.  we got decent service, in fact our server was super nice and cute.  we split a salad that was simply lettuce and spinach with a tomato thrown in. the 5 bucks we spent on that could have purchased both 1 bag of lettuce and 1 bag of spinach.\n\nmy first glass of wine was corked and so much so that when i went to take a drink it burned my eyes but they were very nice about getting me a new glass of wine.\n\nnow on to the pie...  \n\nwe got the spinach special which came with a saccharin sweet sauce; personal preference would be a bit tangier but it was the grease and the crust that was the bummer.  when i get thin crust i like it to be crisp but this? not so much.  mush to the sogg town. \n\ncan't say that we will come back, there are just too many good pizza places in town."

1,"Hubby and I were so incredibly happy when we saw that there's a place on the Mainland that has Meat Jun.  We were so excited to try it out and this place did not disappoint.  The Meat Jun is just as good as in Oahu.  For those that don't know, meat jun, is Korean BBQ marinated meat that's dipped in egg batter and then cooked.  It might sound weird but it's so good.  We also tried the BBQ chicken and the short ribs and both were great.  Service was super friendly.  Get that aloha vibe.  Made me miss Hawaii so much.  They served the typical Korean side dishes but they also served sliced up sauteed hot dog and onion and I've never seen that before but it just hit the spot.  So simple and so good.  I think we'll be coming here every time we're in Vegas for our Meat Jun-fix."
1,"This is my one stop shopping place by work.  Great pricing on things I need, friendly employees, deli for lunch, wifi &  WF Bank if needed."
0,"Im not sure if its due to the fact that its located in a mall, or because the mall itself is just outside of a dumpy neighborhood (guadalupe). But the patrons of this theater dont seem to have common movie etiquette. As the pg-13 movie was beginning, i saw a man come in with 4 babies. Yep 4 babies. Anyone who has been in this situation, knows the rest of this story. Movie theaters are loud. And no place for a baby. Let alone 4 of them. And its an adult movie. Not some disney flick. Anyway, with so many other theater options available i just moved this one to the bottom of the list."
0,"worst ever!  i'm shocked that others haven't taken the time to rate this place!  i had an alarm with cameras put in and i'm going to have to call to cancel. the tech was rude, kept answering his phone while we were talking and putting his finger up telling me to wait!  so rude!  i think i could have let that go if he actually did a good job, but he was a slob and drilled unnecessary holes in my walls and ceiling and then told me that they don't patch!  to top it off, he couldn't be bothered explaining things to me slowly, he was talking so fast that when i went to ask him to repeat something, he would huff!  \n\nthe views from the cameras are terrible and he said that, that's as good as it's going to get.  really?  for the huge amount of money i just paid?  i called customer service and got no where, so i found the local number and spoke to this tech's manager and he was worse!  he said that, that's the tech he sends on all the camera jobs and there's no way there's a problem with him!  wow!  no wonder the tech was the way he was, his manager taught him to act that way!  how are they in business if they treat customers like this!?  use another alarm company!"
0,"Came here on a week night. Place was not packed. But like other reviewers had mentioned, the service was slow. There was only one guy handling every table and we definitely waited a long time before we even saw him.\n\nThe sides were very little, quantity and variety. And it wasn't served until we got our tofu soup (which left me sitting there hungry while we waited for our food; compared to other places where the sides are brought out right away to tie you over until the tofu soup came out). We did get a refill on our sides but I honestly think it might have been because he overheard me mention how other people had wrote it was tough to get a refill. \n\nI didn't like the fact that my rice didn't come in the stone pots. It just came in a metal bowl. I like the crunchy rice at the end!\n\nAs for the tofu soup itself, it was decent. However by the end of the meal, I was still feeling hungry (and usually I'm never hungry after eating at a tofu place). For a tofu soup, there wasn't that much tofu in it at all! I found myself spoon/searching for tofu!\n\nTried it once. Don't think I'll be coming back."
0,"We came here for a few drinks, so I cant speak for the food. Also, im not much of a sushi eater.  The drinks tasted great, so good that I would have thought it was alcohol free if I hadnt known, definitely on the weak side.  My fiance and her friend had the \""60 oz\"" fishbowl which in reality looked no larger than 40 oz and also seemed to be a virigin drink honestly.  Also, the waitress wasnt too attentive and the music was so loud I could hardly speak across the table.  Right above the place is \""school of rock\"" and the bass from the speakers at that venue were enough to be clearly heard inside of this restaurant and even vibrate the walls. Will I be back? Probably, but only because of the free $20 gift card.....free lunch!"
1,"Am I the only one who thinks that an Ethiopian food place is odd? I mean when I was but a young 'un, and didn't finish my plate, my parents told me about all those starving kids in Africa who would love to have the food and all - how can they have a restaurant?\n\nBut I digress. In actuality, there are multiple Ethiopian places to eat in the Queen City, and Meskerem is just the latest that I've tried. The ones I have tried share the same two common traits: One: The service is excellent. Way more friendly than most \""American\"" places (perhaps my parents sent them all my leftovers, and they've spent all this time looking for me to share their gratitude). Two: Injera. This cold, spongy bread is just odd.\n\nIt is pretty cool to be able to eat with your hands, and if young me had it way back when, I might not have had any leftovers to send to those less fortunate, so the service might stink. But for those of us who grew up on a limited palate, it's just strange. Note that I never said I didn't eat it, but it takes some getting used to in order to do so.\n\nLuckily, being able to eat with your hands really helps in that regard, and the flavors from all the other stuff seeping down into it does as well. If you take any leftovers home (not sure if this is common in Ethiopia), then heating it up at home the next day makes it even better.\n\nWith all that in mind, Meskerem is probably the best of the places I've tried for Ethiopia. I just have to make sure they know I'm not sending them any more leftovers. Of course, they could probably look at me and figure that one out."
1,"If you want to get away from the chain store restaurants that dominate in this area and try some excellent Mediterranean food for dinner, this is the place. As long as you aren't looking for fine dining. \n\nRun by an Albanian native, Sofra has an eclectic menu. We went all Mediterranean, and loved it. \n\nFirst the wine list: Three or four dozen wines, good choices from all over the world, with only one priced over $30. Great start. Once we understood the owner's background, we decided to go all appetizers. We had calamari, hummus, olives, and dolma for a light dinner. The servings were all large, accompanied by plenty of pita bread. The olives were good, the calamari was predictable, the hummus was delightful. \n\nThe dolma: Absolutely delicious. The best I've ever had. They were cooked well so the grape leaves were nice and tender. The rice and feta combination inside was just right. Then the yoghurt/dill/oil sauce made them outstanding, with a hint of tartness and a burst of flavor with each bite. Nothing dull about them. They were memorable, enough so that I'll make an effort to go to Sofra's when in the area just to have the dolma again. \n\nThe decor matches the menu - a bit of everything. Service was good. This isn't a white table cloth restaurant. It's a fun place with some outstanding Mediterranean food."
1,"7/23: Awesome food! I had the AYCE for $21.95 (kids -- not mine -- can get in for $10.95). This is a bargain compared to similar shabu shabu places, which sometimes charge more for just an a la carte or one-kind meat AYCE. \n\nThere's lots of types of meat available, which you can select from the huge freezer on display, and then self-serve. I saw pork, pork belly, beef, chicken, lamb, and various weird animal body parts like intestines, if you're into that. Also clams, wontons, and other selections. \n\nI tried a variety of food, including pork, lamb, and wontons. They also have an extensive menu, which I ordered several orders of chicken wings from (really soft and juicy). Everything seems good here -- I might just go down the list and order 3 or 4 different items each time I come back. The vanilla ice cream was good as well. \n\nThe only problem is I don't know when to stop eating. The food is so delicious! It's like 5 minutes from where I live, but it's also worth the drive from across town. I'll definitely be back!"
1,Of course anywhere in Vegas there will be a line but fortunately we didn't have to wait long with a drop of our hosts name.  I came in extremely ill from being sick.  Not from partying too much but really ill and managed to force myself to see XS.  I'm glad I did!  Lady Gaga says she wants her music to make you feel like a celebrity and I think XS has done just that.  Walking in is absolutely breath taking.  People said just imagine Tryst just bigger.  I'd say ten times better.  This place is definitely not your mundane clubs your used to.  I can't wait to visit this place once I'm actually well enough to enjoy it!  An absolute must-see!
0,"I recently hired this guy for my central heating problem. Since I hired them before for my AC and they did a great job. He check out my heating unit in the attic and told me \nmy ignition module is bad, then I told him I had ordered and already replaced that one and it wasn't working. He replied that \""his works\"" ! He charged me $275 for it which I didn't mind because the heater was working now. I asked him for my old module because I wanted to return it since the vendor sold me an inoperative one, he said he threw somewhere in the attic. I went up there couldn't find my removed module. I called him up he replied \""oh sorry it's in my pocket\"". I asked him to bring it back please. He returned handed me a unit real quick and drove off. I looked at the part and it wasn't the one I ordered. Part number didn't match. I went back up to the heating unit found the module that I had ordered and installed still on there. Basically he never replaced it with a new one. I am an Aircraft technician, I have a lot of experience removing and replacing parts. Anyways called him up, he didn't know what I was talking about. Long story short he charged me $275 for a quick reset..\nWill never hire him again !!!!"
1,"Best sweet potato fries I've ever had. Ever. \n\nJust the right amount of crispy with salt and sugar sprinkled on it and an addictive sweet sauce for dipping. Seriously these things were so good I went back the next night and ordered some to go after having a few drinks. \n\nI honestly don't even remember what my burger tasted like, but if you're staying at/near the Wynn definitely cross the street and check this place out."
0,"Service is non-existent. We had to get up twice to first get someone to take our drink order sheet waiting for 15 mins we then waited another 15 to be able to get someone's attention to bring our drinks that we ordered. Our food came before our drinks and when our drinks came they didn't even get the order right. It was 3 waters and 2 coffees, very difficult. \n\nI think the cook got the sugar and salt mixed up because the hashbrowns were very sweet and you only get about two bites of hashbrowns anyways. \n\nCoffee tastes old.  Omelets are decent but nothing to rave about.\n\nAfter being served our food no one has come back to our table to check on us. \n\nMaybe just don't sit at table #5. Other tables seem to be getting better service. Since I've had so much time to kill waiting for service,  I've seen several tables send back food from incorrect orders. \n\nWe were excited to try a new place for breakfast,  but we won't be coming back here or recommending this place to anyone."
0,"Burger was ok. This place is disgustingly dirty. If a health inspector came in today, that place would have been shut down. Fries were good, but will not return to this chain again."
0,"We decided to go here instead of eating out.  We walked in and placed our orders of what we wanted.  I said the house special chicken meal and she ordered the orange chicken meal.  We were pretty specific with what we wanted.  A few times he asked us, but we kept explaining to make sure he got it right...\n\nAfter paying $40 for the food and walking out, we headed home and opened the food to see that all the orders were wrong.  No house special chicken at all. and the orange chicken could serve a small child only.\n\nPretty unhappy, we called and they guy on the phone said we didn't order the meals, but only the individual servings.  Are you kidding??   I didn't think this was Panda Express.  They delivered and while we wanted them to do that, I decided I just didn't want to deal with them again.\n\nThe food we did eat was ok.. nothing amazing."
0,"We came here because all of the other restaurants were busy.  Had no problem getting a seat here.  Should've realized that was a bad sign. Awkward seating, literally has the ambience of a sports stadium, if you're into that sort of thing.  Food was pretty bad.  We were eager to leave."
0,Worst airport for baggage claim. They move carousels all the time and take forever to deliver the bags. Should be so much easier than what they make it.
1,Great place to sell back items and buy used books/comics/magazine/music!
1,Order was right exactly what I asked for and did all online! I was surprised at the late hours on base normally food establishment close at 8. Only down side on line wouldn't allow me to make my order delivery. Had to drive to pick up! They also don't offer as much in there special offers as other stores in the city do.
0,"I can't in good faith award this place with more than one star at the moment.\n\nWe called Saturday afternoon and made reservations on the rooftop for a group of 8 celebrating a birthday. No mention was made that it was a soft opening with limited menu, but that was indeed the case.\n\nWe walked in to see some friendly smiles awaiting us at the hostess stand which is front and center . The bottom floor was suppose to be \""fine dining\"" the middle more casual, and the top the rooftop bar. I noticed a smell of cigarette smoke as I walked to the second floor and was told that smoking is permitted on the rooftop patio. In my opinion there is nothing like cig smoke to ruin a meal, and felt that smoking should be limited till after dining hours. \n\nThe patio itself was VERY dark (see photo- and that's before sundown). That being said it's a great view of the sky line. Our server did not light the small candles at our table and we went to our neighbors to borrow a lighter. The dim light was not nearly bright enough to see and our table resorted to using their cell phone lights to eat by. My meal had very small bones in it too so I had to be extra careful. If you're drinking at this establishment watch your drink, the dim lights unfortunately leave you susceptible to all kinds of things. Another issue was the chairs were much higher than the table and my 5'7 frame had my legs brushing the table- many of the men in our group couldn't fit their legs underneath.\n\nOur server was a newbie. The dinner service took quite a long time, it was about an hour before we were even able to get our order in (and had to request to do so). She opened a bottle of champagne and was about to literally tilt and pop it until I suggested she use her apron and slowly open it like a soda bottle. She explained she never opened a bottle before. I found that odd for a place that is attempting to be a fine-dining establishment . I asked for some orange juice because I didn't care for the champagne I ordered and she just brought the juice and didn't consider I might have preferred something else. She also walked away from the table mid-sentence while taking our order to  pour drinks at the table next to us. Any issue we had was met with the same excuse \""it's our soft opening.\"" We were still paying full price so we expected our meals and service to at least be decent.\n\nBread was served quite late, and we were definitely hungry two hours into the meal when our food came out.  The taste was  good but the portions were extremely small, temperatures were off (soup was cool),, and it was overpriced. My friend ordered a $15 sandwich ( about the size of an egg Mcmuffin) and asked if it came with a side. Our server said she didn't know and to order it anyway. When she brought it out she explained it wasn't included. Throughout our meal we literally ate with our cell phone lights and the experience was laughable.  We actually had people in our group order additional food at the next place we stopped because they were still very hungry. \n\nI apologize for the long-winded review, but honestly the part which burned me the most was when we explained that it was our friends bday she actually told the birthday girl they didn't do birthdays - the birthday girl! I spoke with management who brought out two desserts after I explained the situation. She was nice and definitely listened to my problems but two small desserts for 8 people was a bit insufficient considering the number of problems we had. \n\nI will give it another shot because it is in the neighborhood, but I'm not sure I'd go as far to order food again there. I hope this place can do better ...."
0,"The last 3 trips to cold stone have left me with an overpriced, freezer burned, uneatable cup of \"" I am never going here again\"" the kids convinced me to go back times 2 and 3, but never again."
0,"Papa Johns Pizza says it all. I was in the mood for fast pizza and gave this place and their pizza a shot.  I have had Pap Johns in the past but nothing in recent memory as I like to try other local joints than big chains most of the time.\n\nSo, overall it was what I remembered, OK, nothing special and it met the need for fast pizza."
1,"Oh, how I miss this place!  This was our favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  They give you huge portions for really cheap. They aren't jerks about substitutions or special orders.  Just lots of normal greasy food.  They serve breakfast all day.  If you just order a salad, the salads are bigger than your head and they give you a whole bowl full of dressing.  I had the chef salad all the time.\n\nSome of the waitresses are a little kooky, but you soon figure out which servers to ask for.  Jeremy was a great waiter if he's still there.  He'd see us coming in and grab a high chair and find us a table before the hostess even saw us.  Jeremy seems to make it a point to go the extra mile for his regulars. He remembers what they always drink, what they usually like to order, their special requests, their kids names.  That guy earns his tips.  He is on the ball.  The little old lady with the thick accent is slow but she's a nice little old lady.  One of the waitresses with dyed hair is a bit too chatty and we avoided sitting in her section whenever possible.  She's definitely weird but totally harmless I promise!  \n\nIf you're all high class don't bother with this place, you won't like it.  If you want normal food for cheap and you want to be full when you leave, this is the place to go.  We would generally try to go when they weren't crazy busy though because the wait can be long sometimes.  Like when the after church crowd gets there.\n\nThe decor is loud and smart alecky.  The food is normal diner food.  It is the kind of place that has a lot of \""regulars\"" that go there all the time including a lot of older folks.  And if you become regulars like we did, they get to know you and you get to know them and the place really grows on you."
0,"Terrible service. Management is terrible to say the least. We got to our room and it was 80 degrees. A maintenance gentleman came to our room and had to make some repairs. We explained the situation to Darrin (front desk manager) and he refused to comp the night even though we slept in 80+ degree weather! Little does he know we review hotel rooms for a living...the BAR will definitely be hearing about this as well as his boss, Gary Austin. Don't stay here!"
1,"I learned about Spatini from AZ Spa Girls and loved the $20 gel special. Jeannie told me that is ongoing with $5 for polish removal. Such a good deal. She didn't even charge extra for the French gel manicure. \n\nI was thrilled to have the option to book online and was able to make an appointment for the same day. Jeannie did a great job on my nails, and I was out in 30 minutes. The next day, I noticed some very small bubbles on the white tips of some of my nails. That bothered me a little but thankfully, I didn't detect a change in the texture due to it. Overall, I was very happy with my manicure. A week and a half later, they still look good..."

1,"Great wine and great customer service!\nWe were in Scottsdale for my friend's bachelorette party, and we did the \""bottling party\"" at Su Vino.  We had a big table that sat all 8 of us, with cheese, fruit and crackers, and our own personal wine maker bringing us tastes and explaining the different wines.  Then we were able to bottle our own wine, and put our own label on it (we had a picture of all of us girls).\nIt was a blast!  I would definitely recommend a visit here!"
0,"Everybody I know loves Haji-Baba. For me it's just okay. I love Mediterranean food - veggies, hummus, babbaganouch (sp?) and all the rest. I just feel that the food here is mediocre. With as many choices as there are in the valley for finer food, this one ranks lower. If you're on a budget, however, this is your place. Great prices."
1,"My friend suggested we meet here and I immediately thought BJ Brewery.  I was a little concerned when I pulled up as it looks small and a bit seedy from the outside, but I'm glad he suggested the place.\n\nFor the most part it was pretty empty except for the obvious regulars.  The bartenders were great, hilarious and very friendly.  We didn't even realize it but time flew by and we only had a few drinks and some food.  The hot wings are pretty good, but they got the endorsement of a few true Buffalo Wings experts from Buffalo NY, so I 'm thinking I will have to give them another try...just for that reason.\n\nI've been to the other BJ locations in town off 215 but felt this place has a much better atmosphere.  I think we might have found a new hang out just off the strip."
0,I bought tires from this Goodyear location about 3 months ago.i also wanted an oil change I came back 2 hours later because they said it was ready as I was about to leave I noticed there wasn't a new sticker for the mileage on your next oil change so I questioned them they apologized because they didn't even do the oil change.  Fine. The manager apologized and even installed wipers for me for free. Last week I went to get another oil change and tire rotation .came back a few hours later they said it was ready and my tires werent rotated .today I had to install a new battery only to find my my coolant at minimum my windshield wiper fluid at minimum fluids not topped off even though it is part of their oil change. Very disappointed in the service .I've been very patient
0,"It's a shame. It's really a shame that the first Yelp review that I felt that I must absolutely, indubitably, without question write to share with the world would be because of how incredibly bad a restaurant's food is.\n\nI was not really bothered by the lack of chopsticks (something fellow reviewer Tomomi points out) at the table right off despite being Asian myself. I was more bothered by the lack of pretty much anything at the tables. It's a vietnamese restaurant! Where are the condiments?? They do serve pho there (which I had the misfortunate of trying... more on that very soon), so I was surprised that there was nothing to add some flavour to them with except for a little salt and pepper! No spicy sauce, none of that sweet black sauce I simply adore (I believe it's called hoisin sauce), nothing. Boy, I found out very soon that maybe it was because they wouldn't have made much of a difference when I got my main course.\n\nThe first item I got are spring rolls. They were largely unmemorable for the most part. What stood out to me were the added chicken slices in there, something I've never eaten in spring rolls. Now, I do not claim to know or care about things like what exactly spring rolls should contain to be \""authentic\"" and all that jazz. In fact, I've had spring rolls with pork before at another viet restaurant, and they're one of my favourite items from that restaurant because of how amazingly well put-together they are in terms of flavour. What bugged me about these spring rolls was that the chicken slices were blaaaaaand. Furthermore, there was something in their quality that was off-putting. It's kind of hard to explain; it's like it was lower than let's say, supermarket standards, you know what I mean?\n\nThen came the pho. Oh my goodness I have never squandered money on anything more wasteful than that pho. Instead of the noodles simmering in aromatic beef broth surrounded by delicious, tender cuts of meat, I got a very confusing assortment of random vegetable toppings literally just boiled in water. I thought to myself, \""What is all this??\"" Cauliflower? Broccoli?? Do you want to know the best part? The mystery chicken slices have made their appearance once again. Their bland flavour was even more accentuated by the plain boiled water they were sitting in surrounded the unseasoned everything else. I took a quick glance to my left for anything, anything at all that could act as a saving grace. Nope, just the little salt and pepper shakers.\n\nI was so floored by what was going on that I tried to convince myself that it wasn't so bad. I even insisted to my mother that I would eat it. In the end, I could only bear taking a couple more bites before giving up. I left hungry and ten bucks poorer.\n\nSo, in summary (in case you didn't want to read my entire review), do NOT go to this place. Just don't."
0,"The Sheraton Downtown Phoenix is a beautiful hotel.  The rooms were very clean and nice and the beds are comfortable.  \n\nThis review is based on their poor customer service.  We checked in Friday 06/13, the line was not too long and we figured it would move fast... it didn't.  As we were waiting we could hear the conversation going on behind us which consisted of a guest's card not working after being reactivated twice and here was was waiting in line for a 3rd time.  Finally after about 15-20 minutes we get to the counter.  Since we had to park in the \""overage parking lot\"" right across the hotel I made sure to ask if there would be a fee or if I would have to get the ticket validated.  The front desk clerk (wish I would have wrote down her name) told me it was complimentary with our room and we would not be charged for parking.\n\nChecked out the next morning around 6am, the kiosk kept trying to charge us $19.40.  Since the front desk clerk said it was complimentary we rang the bell and told them what was going on.  They didn't say anything but simply released the lever for us to get out so I figured everything was ok.\n\nTwo days later there is the charge for parking on my credit card.  I finally got around to calling them today, a few hours later an employee named Ishban (sp?) called me back.  I told him the entire situation and he would not issue a refund or any kind of compensation.  If I would have known they were going to charge me I would have parked somewhere else for much less than almost $20!  What bad customer service, especially for a hotel.  Very disappointed."
0,"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""Are you working?\"" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it."
1,"I opened my Chase bank account at this location because it was close. When I opened my account, my banker was friendly and gave me all the information I needed. She answered all my questions and made sure I was happy with everything because I had explained about my past banking experiences. When I went back to ask about setting up my online banking, the teller was nice enough to show me how and did it right there for me. I had returned again to deposit several transactions and they explained how to do it through the ATMs outside and inside the store. They're quick and friendly compared to other banks I've been to."
1,"We absolutely loved the show! My friend and I were both big fans of the group from their MTV show and were excited to see them at Luxor. They did not disappoint, the show was hilarious (had us laughing out loud) and their dance skills/choreography are amazing!!! The audience participation was funny and they also had everyone out of their seats dancing along with them. I thought it was great that they seem to incorporate the latest big hits into their routine (loved their \""Car\"" scene to I'm Different by 2Chainz). I would def recommend this show to others!! If you are looking for laughs, good music and good dancing...you need to check out the Jabbawockeez!!!"
0,"Their waiters need to learn basic math. I ordered an alcoholic drink (I AM over 21, but I look younger) and the waiter took my ID and studied it for a good minute, then gave it back, said OK and went off to get our drinks. The drink I received was nonalcoholic, and so was the 2nd one I ordered (I tried a different type of drink this time)"
1,"Good guys here, they aren't just out to steal your money. I've never felt pressured to buy anything I didn't come in for, even though they may give you recommendations."
1,Hopefully the happy hour will get back to the way it used to be. It's a great place to go on a Friday after work. Some good people and good happy hour vittles to nosh on before dinner.
1,Came in to eat late at night and they had a variety of Buffalo wings. I can't believe there were so many types. I was looking for Buffalo Wild Wings and the hotel had a list of place to eat and I stumble upon this place. Very good wings.
1,"This place had the cheapest and best falafil (that is how they spell it) pita of anywhere in town.\n\nThe falafel was moist, flavorful the lettuce was fresh and there was a copious amount of sauce to cover it. The pita was a bit thin but that can be over looked. At under $3 it might be worthwhile to get two. \n\nAs for the hummous we had on the side, it was a great texture but a bit low on flavor. Make sure you order an extra pita and it comes with just one. \n\nWe got the order to go so we did not really have any service to review.  \n\nWhen you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most Americans. \n\nThere is an attached small market full of spices, and exotics foods and flavored tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice. The counter is full of many types of balaclava and olives.\n\nIf you want a great falafel pita at a good price, be brave and stop in. Just leave your Pro Bush / Israel gear in the car."
1,"thought this place was super fun and full of great info about Nevada, get ready to do lots of reading would not recommend bringing kids under 15 they will probably be pretty bored.They had some 9/11 stuff too like a steel beam from one of the twin towers."
1,"I stayed at the Aria a few weeks ago. It is a very nice upscale and beautiful hotel. It is a large hotel and can overwhelm when you first arrive. Check-in is friendly and rather quick for the lines they have. Most of the stores, bars and restaurants are what I would consider to be upscale. It is in a nice location which is located in the midst of the strip. The rooms were comfortable. Technology at its best with remote lighting, curtains, etc. Overall, it was a great experience."
0,Food is just ok and the employees I've dealt with are so rude (girls) and if you ask them for anything they act put out.
0,"Owner is not friendly, and their pricing is ridiculous - $7.50 for a blouse and a collared shirt? How are there other items on their racks?? No way...bad enough that next time I'll drive the 6 miles out of my way to go to my previous cleaner."
1,"When Sofi's opened it was a refreshing change to the typical pubs in the area.  Quirky and fun with a decent selection of drinks and pleasant bar staff.\n\nThe draught beers are a bit limited, but there are plenty of bottles and the swedish cider selection was unusually good before it became more commonplace.\n\nI haven't been to any of the 'nights' that they run (knitting, cinema etc), but it's great place to meet friends for a catch up."
1,"I think they made me a 23-egg omelet. It was honestly enough for four people, but it was delicious so I may have eaten two peoples' shares. I customized my own with spinach and mushrooms, and the innards were cooked perfectly. The omelet could have been fluffier, but I imagine it take some time to flip an omelet that weighs 2 lbs. I also had some biscuits which were covered in some of the richest gravy I have ever eaten. I didn't touch the potatoes on the side because I was too full from eating everything else.\n\nThe best part of the this restaurant, in my opinion, is the coffee bar that is attached to the restaurant, but accessible through a side door. This really helps with the early morning wait. Simply ingenious."
1,"This was our sixth Cirque show and it was awesome! I'm going to include this first so you don't waste your money on seat upgrades: the floor seats aren't the best seats in the house. Don't spend the $200+ per ticket because you'll actually miss some of the performers. We had the very last row and loved our seats- which I know sounds strange but let me explain. When you click on the seating for the stadium, the stage looks huge. However, the show is divided up into four stage sections so that each section gets it's own show for the most part. Also- the stadium seating is extremely steep so even the back row is closer than you would ever expect. The show has so many performers, and a lot going on in the air above the seats past the stage- this is what you wouldn't see if you were in the front section because this would all be behind you. \n\nOK, the show itself is long and there is no intermission so get your drinks and bathroom breaks in before hand. We weren't sure what to expect, but the story covers the entire history of the Beatles, which is very cool, but a little depressing during a few parts. Confetti falls from the ceiling at a couple different parts and there is never a dull moment as there were several stage changes and continuous music. It was almost sensory overload. We weren't sure about spending more than the usual cost for the traveling shows, but honestly it's a completely different experience (starting with the more comfortable seats) and I would recommend going."
1,"Hubby wanted some kind of brunch today with a view.  After about 10 minutes of burning some brain cells, I finally remembered this restaurant by a pond or lake off of Buffalo.\nIf you are in need of a nice sit down, take your time brunch with a view, this is the place to be.\nI ordered 3 poached eggs in this wine reduction sauce of mushrooms, ham bits and shallots.  My taste buds were in heaven!  Hubby ordered the steak and eggs with potatoes which were just as tasty.\nAnd of course we had apple crumb with vanilla ice cream for dessert.\nThis bistro has many different types of wine, (I had an Italian Pinot Grigio with my meal).\nIt was over 100 degrees but very comfortable in the outside seating under the shade with mist spraying.  Beautiful big lake with swans, carp and these cute little turtles.\nThe food, ambiance, and waiter all made it a 5 star restaurant!"
1,"Led under the pretence of fire, crazy rituals and even mild nudity I was keen to see what the fuss surrounding the Beltane Fire Festival was all about. Taking a gamble with the \u00a38 ticket price I left for Calton Hill well stocked with beer, a smearing of face paint or two and my fingers crossed that I was in for a unusual and unique evening of entertainment. \n\nAllegedly based on Celtic tradition, the Beltane Festival sees 'clans' of painted torchbearers and processional drummers parade around Calton Hill performing various rituals and demonstrations resulting in an intriguing and somewhat bizarre spectacle.\n\nParticularly notable were the red imp style characters that seemed hell bent on making the most noise and intimidating not only the other 'clans' but the audience themselves. Wild screaming, erratic waving of flaming torches, twisted and contorted dances created some down right weird scenes, and with the evenings attire limited to loin cloths only, there were more than a few eye brows raised.\n\nI'd certainly recommend the Beltane Fire Festival.  Accompanied with some cheap booze and a group of companions you'll be fixated with the events visual offerings and pounding drums. The events held once a year (30th April) and\n\n...between us Yelpers, I was reliably informed you can sneak in by hopping a wall or two. Otherwise tickets are available from the Forest Cafe, Ripping Records or at the festival entrance."
0,"I looked forward to this meal for months but was sadly dissapointed.  I had the posole, the rough cut tuna, and the shrimp tamale.  My wife had the chile relleno.  We found the food to be fairly bland and not mediocre.  The place was beautiful, the beer and service were great, but honestly, I came for a kick-ass meal and this place flopped in that department.   Out of what we had I'd say the tuna was the best...."
1,"For our birthdays, my parents treated me and my husband out to Famous Dave's. Our waitress, Brenda, was really good and friendly and I could have sworn she'd been a waiter for a long time but she told us that it was her first week. Nevertheless, she knew the entire menu and answered my mom's questions about the garbage can platter. \n\nLet me say that the ribs are seriously meaty!!! About an inch thick from the bone. I love all the choices in the barbeque sauces. Their coleslaw is super creamy (I don't think it has onions in it, hey, not everyone can eat onions). The pork and beans were warm and not from a can. Afterwards, they brought out ice cream for us on account of our birthdays and the cool part is they bring it out with a sparkling Roman candle on the plate; it's quite a sight. \n\nOnly dinged them one star for a few MINOR reasons. The platter is just too much meat. It's almost nothing BUT meat. It'd be great if they mixed it up and replaced those huge chicken breasts with more of those carrot sticks (we only got two for four people), and maybe with onion rings or mustard potato salad. The corn muffins are NOT good at all. They taste like cardboard. \n\nOn a quick note, the little drawing that the waitress is forced to draw on the plate is useless. It's trivial and the plate just takes up more room on an already cramped table."
1,"We heard about this place from friends and they were right: This place is awesome!\n\nWhen you order here, keep in mind most dishes can feed two people. On the other hand, our dish came \""served with fresh fruit\"", which turned out to be only two pieces of fruit. The rest of our food was plentiful, though. And all of it was so fresh and so delicious! I loved that my side of fresh fruit ( I ordered extra because I wanted more than the two pieces) wasn't the ordinary grapes, etc. you'll find at most places. No, here you get fresh pineapple, huge orange slices, strawberries and such that have all been ripened to perfection. :D\nThe staff was friendly, too. Sometimes the music got a little too loud, but otherwise the atmosphere was great."
1,"I came here on date night with my boyfriend, and we were blown away! Our server Maria was awesome, she was super nice, and seriously was one of the best servers I've had in a while. \nWe started off with chips and guacamole, which were amazing... And I also ordered the skinny marg which was HUGE and equally awesome! We ordered the fajitas for two and it was super tasty and a TON of food. We will definitely be back!"
1,"LOVE the food!\nIt's got such an amazing selection of food and deserts are UNREAL. \nIt can be kind of costly though, especially for students. So try to go on less busy nights.\nThey have a salad bar and several main course bars, along with many selections of deserts (including lots of ice cream!)\nIt's great for big groups, call ahead to request a room. They have tonnes of space for people. It's fun for kids - the front lobby has a pond with fish and there are tanks throughout the restaurant that also have cool fish to look at. \nThe food is always so good I never want to leave. Go hungry because this buffet delivers on every level!"
0,"I went last year and had a blast. This year, not so much. I bought general admission and tequila tent tix online for myself and an out of town friend so we could avoid lines and the hassle of buying them there. No hassle avoided. The people at the entrance were so confused that it took at least 20 minutes for us to finally enter the festival, and there was no line at the time. We had to stop at two separate tables to finally get actual entry tickets in exchange for our online tix. Even though we bought our tequila tent tix in advance, we were told that they ran out of bracelets - and the bracelets had removable tabs for tequila samples. They unapologetically provided us with makeshift entry tickets, which were not accepted without a heated discussion with the carnies manning the line outside the entry to the tequila tent. Unfortunately, no amount of tacos or tequila could compensate for the poor organization and hostile event workers."
0,"The atmosphere is spot-on, but where was the service? (12/7/08)\n\nThe place has a great feeling from the moment you walk up and see a grand piano on the front stage, a full bar, and flower centerpieces on the tables. Very pleasant.\n\nI loved to little Sunday Brunch Menus, simple and sweet. Great Mimosas, and want to go back to try out their Sangeria.\n\nThe service was a little slow all around. Felt like was being avoided, plus the servicer did not speak mucho englas, so there was no way to get some of my questions answered. \n\nAlthough the food sounded appealing, was disappointed when the it came out cold and soggy. Hoping this was just an off day, but want to still see how it works next time."
1,"This dinner was wonderful.  I had the rigatoni and found it absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend had the lobster gnocchi and found nothing to complain about whatsoever.  I am giving this place four stars based on the food.\n\nThe service was smothering.  We barely had a chance to glance over the menus before he came to our table.  He was overly helpful, making the service seem comical yet annoying.\n\nI found a few things that prevented me from giving it five stars.  I do not drink during dinner and therefore ordered a coke.  My boyfriend's beer was six dollars, my coke was 5. That is just outrageous.\n\nFor a good meal, come to this restaurant.  For great service?  I have seen better."
1,"Take all of your friends! I took a group of friends here and despite their lack of culinary adventure, they loved it and so did I. The tapas were excellent and flavorful. The seafood was tasty and ple-according to my non-veg friends.\n\nThe meat looked delicious and everyone fought for the last piece. \n\nFunky, eclectic And supports local artists. Chef/ Owner greeted us, not sure if he usually does that but he was really cool.\n\nAlso, don' t be discouraged by its off strip location, it was worth ditching the bland buffets and pulling our car out of hotel lot for a short drive, it's right off the freeway. \n\nGreat place!"
1,"Pretty good food and usually a good time. Staff always seems nice and knows what they are doing, always seems busy also...they have cheap drinks and usually specials. I recommend the wings or the provolone(fried).!"
0,"To start...2hr delay because the Crew didn't show up. Packed to the gills. No free snacks at all on a 5hr flight. Crazy long wait for skycap \""service\"". Kiosks to get boarding passes were slooooow and attendants seemed to hate their jobs & customers as much as were the experience. Once on the plane we had the oldest and slowest man attempting to serve us drinks. Took two hours! It was almost comical. Then he rested his butt on my husband shoulder while he was waiting for an ice refill! Oh and they broke my bag. Why did I try another airline Southwest?!"
0,"Terrible breakfast. I ordered for pickup and was told it would be ready in 30 mins. After arriving 35 mins later the food order had not even been put in!! After standing around for another 30 mins the food was finally given to me without so much as an apology. The staff even had the audacity to ask me if when I called that someone quote \""picked up the phone.\"" I will never eat here again."
0,"This club was reccomended by people because of the hype and djs,  we got into the guest list of 14 girls. We had to wait all the way outside until you can get to the line inside the casino. It was fucking ridiculous. This was the line to get in free so you cant really complain I guess,But it gets worse once youre inside. \n\nTraffic jam everywhere!  Rude bouncers flashing lights in your face. They over compacity this place making it impossible to get any air or place to dance. And when you do find a place to take a breather, the bouncers rudely make you move the fuck out. If you cant handle all that people inside a club, then you should have maximum limit. Never again. Save your time and go to xs instead. \n\nF.y.i The layout of the club wasnt anything exciting either."
1,"4 stars for location and maybe 3 for food. Drink specials weren't amazing but not bad either. The location is what makes this place - right outside Monti's in a great patio. \n\nWe went before a concert and had a few drinks and some apps. The positives of the food were that you could get $5 tapas but they were pretty simple. Our favorite was the braised beef and chirizo on the sweet potato chip. It  was filling and tasty. The taco had braised beef but wasn't my favorite. It was really messy and just didn't taste as good. We also had the chicken lollipops which were different than i thought they would be - they were grilled chicken with franks red hot on top. Now don't get me wrong, that combo can't do anyone wrong, but for a restaurant/bar with that kind of rep, you would think they were the bone in wings, frenched and then presented differently. Call me whatever you want for that comment - just saying.\n\nAnyway, we will be back here anytime we are around since we did have fun, we had great service and it is a great patio. For the money, the food wasn't the worst but i would rather go somewhere else, even if it was a bit more money."
1,"This is the most self-inflicted adrenaline I've felt since bungee jumping.\n\nFirst, let me say that guns scare the crap out of me. I don't even like being near a police officer with a holstered weapon... so walking into a shop full of assault rifles is like my adult version of a horror movie.  Still, I was with 5 other guys who were up for the adventure, so I got hold of my nerves and jumped into the breach.\n\nWe paid $110 each for some version of a party package that gave each of us the chance to shoot (a) a clip full on each of 4 different machine guns and (b) 2 rounds from a 50 caliber desert eagle handgun. For all those boys (and girls) out there who grew up with plastic guns or even shooting a rifle out somewhere at a range, it's fair to say that this is in a whole different league.\n\nFor the machine guns, we chose the Uzi, Mac-10, M-5 and Grease Gun. The M-5 and Grease Gun were scarily easy and accurate to shoot, whereas the Uzi and Mac-10 felt a bit more wild but were fun just because they show up so often in the gangster movies.\n\nThe Desert Eagle handgun was intense. I'm not a big guy, so this thing felt like I could barely hang onto it. Still, we were able to shoot it with remarkable accuracy and the whole thing just served as a good reminder that it's awfully easy to kill people with guns.\n\nLet me also give credit where it's due to the guys who run this place. When I first heard about shooting machine guns in Vegas, I started to imagine a bunch of drunk guys all standing next to one another with loaded weapons and well, the potential for very bad things. That is not what really happens here. On the Saturday we were in, the Center was staffed by four very friendly but experienced ex-servicemen who make it clear that they have been around the block a few times. Out on the range, we were only with our 6 friends and we were accompanied by two staff members, one of whom is assigned to each weapon. They also stand right behind the the active weapon with a hand up, in a gesture that's comforting to both the shooter and those around him.  \n\nI think it would be easy and probably natural for the staff here to look down on us yuppie types from NY and SF, but we never felt that. To me that in itself was impressive.\n\nAnd last but not least, Dave, the guy who I'd guess to be the owner, regaled us with his personal stories shooting each of these weapons in active duty (e.g., \""Oh, you think that 50 caliber is loud in there? One time I was being chased down an alleyway in Sierra Leone when...\"")  \n\nIn any event, this is a fantastic option for those looking to branch beyond the casino while in Vegas. So head on in and hear the rest of Dave's stories for yourself."
1,One of my favorite gas station to stop at.  The store is always clean and the staff is friendly.  This location is convenient and has a red box outside the store.  The have hot and ready to serve pizza and wings as well. One thing I love about this gas station I can't even recall a time where someone has come up to me and asked for money which is definitely a plus.  The pumps are always clean and the parking lot is always kept up.  I can say I actually look forward to stopping here and filling up with Petro!
1,"this place is so wonderful! warm bread always, good food, service is amazing. I always have to come here first when I get to Vegas. Wish they had one in the Bay Area. I se people compare it to Cheescake Factory but this is way better but yet somewhat similar. Located in The Venetian Hotel."
1,"I am here at least once a week. The food is amazing 4/5 of the time and they staff the friendliest people!!! The restaurant is a bit small and they are always busy and there are times when we can't get a table right away...but the Ahi tacos are amazing and they have TRUFFLE FRIES! Serves great breakfast all day which is fantastic. It has a very hipster vibe so it totally fits me. And I like that they have daily/weekly specials that are so creative and flavorful. I enjoy trying something new when I go and when I do I don't regret it, but of course I come back for my favorites too!"
1,"I can definitely agree with another reviewer's description  of Ulta as the red-headed stepsister to sephora. Sephora is the mother of all product junkies' one stop shops. Ulta is where you go if you don't have the time or patience to run to Sephora and are not partial to online shopping.\n\nI've never had any major problems at this Ulta-I know what they carry and I always know what I want when I run in here, so that helps. The line is usually very long, especially when they've just released their quarterly 20% off coupons which apply to everything in the store including fragrance and their prestige lines which aren't covered with their usual coupons. They've expanded in the past five years with more high end make up lines, but I can't really comment on those because I hardly ever buy make up. Actually, unless it's Bare Escentuals, I don't buy it. \n\nThey have a great selection of hair products such as salon-style brushes, products like Redken, Frederic Fekkai, and CHI, all of which I highly recommend. They're pricey, but like any product well worth it, they make a difference and last a while. And it doesn't hurt to stock up when you get the elusive 20% off coupon. They also have pretty frequent sales on many of their haircare products, so if you find something you like there's a good chance you can get a discount at some point or another and fill up a cabinet or two.\n\nMy only complaint is customer service which is almost never attentive on the floor-they don't appear to be well-staffed. Or they have a phantom staff issue-people not being where they're supposed to be.\n\nOverall, if you get familiar with what Ulta has, you know that you don't come here as a substitute for Sephora, more as a convenient effort at staying pretty."
0,"After getting an oil change here a few times, I needed brakes but had got my own parts as there was some special ones I wanted.  Called to get my car in for service and was refused as \""they won't make enough money\""   I was willing to pay whatever and got my own parts as I wanted better ones then were available locally.  Customer lost!"
0,"Being married to a meat and potatoes kinda guy, I thought booking dinner for Valentine's Day at Fogo de Chao would be a huge treat.  It turned out to be a huge disappointment.  We went last night and will never go back.\n\nWe were seated promptly, way in a back corner...about as far from the salad bar as you can get.  This place is packed with tables.  You literally have to stand and wait as servers and other customers weave through the tables.  I found it strange that staff didn't let customers pass first - they blew by customers as if we didn't exist.  \n\nWe were seated and got the lowdown on how it all worked.  We were excited to be there and dig into the amazing salad bar and try the different meat choices.  Our trip to the salad bar was chaotic.  The line was going every which way and people were reaching over each other to get to the different selections. Everything on the salad bar was fresh, the presentation was nice but what a hassle!\n\nWe were given some rolls which were odd.  Soft, undercooked dough filled with some sort of cheese.  I can eat some bread, but the texture of this stuff was just not right.\n\nThe meat...honestly, I'm not much of a carnivore, but even my husband was far from impressed.  All of it was dry and so salty that we were reaching for our water glasses constantly.  The service was what was really odd.  The skewer guys would show up in our section in such a rush that they missed our table (and others) most of the time.  You have to wave them down or ask passing busboys to get service.  By the time the pork ribs and rib eye came around (after my husband spoke to our server about the lack of service) all of the sides were cold and we were just over it and full from the massive amount of water we had to drink.\n\nWe are not tough to please people.  We don't do pricey restaurants often and were really looking forward to having a fun experience at Fogo.  I regret booking our Valentines dinner at this strange, silly place.  Should have gone with my first instinct and headed to Durant's for  tried and true great food and perfect service.  Live and learn."
1,"Wow, the food is amazing, the service great.   Very imaginative options to customize your burger including homemade sauces you won't find anywhere else.  The bar is good but I wouldn't mind seeing a Pub Ale on tap.  You won't walk away without a smile on your face."
1,"From the moment you pull up someone is there to greet you. Very nice and professional, almost too nice ha. Explained the service very clearly and gave me an accurate wait time. Got an inspection and was in and out in about 15 minutes. Can't complain, there guys are good!"
0,I switched in July 2013 from the PNC YMCA downtown to Gold's.  My issue is with the staff.  More than once I had extra fees or twists in my membership come up because the staff neglected to give me all the info.  Example: today I was charged an annual fee that I was unaware of.  Not cool.\n\nOverall the equipment gets the job done.  The men's locker room is usually quite a mess and smells awful.
0,"RUDE OWNER!\nWe have been going to Grimaldi's now Grazzianos for 10 years.  We are a family of 5 and My stepson who is 26, and husband are BIG eaters. They can easily eat enough food for a family of 6 all by themselves. Today, we walked out and vowed never to return because of the owners rude behavior. We love the wings and the happy hour specials and always support a family business over the big boys. Anyhoooo....\nIf you order hot wings it must be in increments of at least 6 and you get a dressing. If you order in increments of 12, you still only get one dressing. So my stepson has 2 orders of 6, just so he can get his 2 dressings. Well when they refused to give him 2, without charging him the extra .59 cents. I mean the money won't break us, but the principal of it all is crazy. So he calls the owner over and asks her. As soon as she got to our table she was rude and told him in a tone \""so basically your wanting to get out of paying the extra .59 cents. No\"" I have never seen a restaurant owner speak to someone like this. Then we called her back when the food arrived, and she struts over to our table and first thing out of her mouth was \""Now what?!\"" Really? That left a bad taste in our mouth and he told her \""forget it. Give me the check for the drinks and salad. We are leaving\"" She argues and says \""over .59 cents?\"" He says \""No. Over your attitude, I did not need to be talked to like that\"" She says \""You don't understand how expensive ranch dressing is!\"" In her condescending tone. I was floored. She lost our weekly business for sure. Now, as a restaurant owner she should have written off the ranch dressing as we have been loyal customers for YEARS. The other people who work there are nice and I feel bad for them, if she treats her customers like this imagine how she treats them. I hope she sees this review and responds with her feedback. SHE has no one to blame  for lost business but herself."
1,"I found this company just by chance. But was very pleasantly surprised by professionalism, timeliness and quality of the service. Phillip was very prompt, provided good explanation of the issue and made the repairs with a reasonable price tags. I have used services of Boldt twice and am very satisfied. Would highly recommend."
1,We havent been in this place since it was bobby mqees! I am real skeptical about bbq joints as i love bbq and am very picky...i was surprised ! the ribs where amazing.tender and flavorfull.Took my family there and we all had a great dinner.
1,"Spectacle at every turn. You can check in for a drink at the bar, enjoy dinner in an ocean liner of a room, catch a wild floor show in another, and end in their sedate (by their standard) library bar for a nightcap.  All the while experiencing in each room a different singer, musician, dancer... You name it.  Vegas hasn't had something that sophisticated since the 60s.\n\nThe drinks are top notch.  The food is exquisite overall with some yawns but they seem have a management that will change things to the point where they feel its ALL perfect."
0,"Worst Experience of My Life!  I went in today with bags full of amazing clothes and shoes as I work in the fashion industry.  The girl who looked through my items or should I say barely looked took 2 pairs of shoes.  That's it!  She was so lazy she didn't even check out what I had.  I brought in Prada, Fendi, and all Couture names.  I watched more people lug their stuff in and right back out so I wouldn't waste your time trying to sell anything at this shop as it's a complete waste of time."
0,"Apparently my expectations were tooooooo high.  Was told by foodies that this place was a must eat.  However my pool attendant said it wasn't.  First where is the \""fusion\""?  The menu had food from both places but nothing that mixed them.  The waiter said we had to have the best taco in the world...carnitas.  Being from San Diego it was just ok.  The salsa for it was worth the $5.  For the main course we got the Mongolian beef lettuce and Kao Lao Loa noodles.  We were told it was family style so it would be plenty of food.  If you consider 5 small pieces of beef and a plate full of lettuce enough then you are in the right place.  The one piece off beef I had was good.  Too bad they are too cheap to actually make it family style.  The worst part was the noodles.  When I order noodles I expect a plate full of noodles.  This was individual coils of noodles stood up on their end in a bamboo steam pot.  There was 20 noodles with a tiger dipping sauce.  I almost spit up up the sauce on the first bite.  Was like dirty water.  Way too much hype very little to actually eat.  I will never go back."
1,"I hired Brianna to do hair and makeup for me, my mom, and my six bridesmaids for my September 2012 wedding.  Brianna was very professional and accommodating given the number of women she had to prepare in a short time frame, and definitely remained calm under pressure.  I did a hair and makeup trial with Brianna a couple of months prior to the big day, and in between the trial and the wedding date, I completely changed my mind as to how I wanted my hair and makeup.  No problem for Brianna!  She was very understanding, and based on the trial, I completely trusted her to do a great job executing my new vision.  I love, love, LOVED my hair for the wedding, and I was most impressed by the makeup she did for each girl and my mom.  She was able to work with each to achieve the looks they wanted, while still maintaining consistency across the whole group.  The pictures turned out fabulous!  I highly recommend Brianna to other brides!"
1,Brunch was PEARFECT!  The paradise in Tukee was awesome!!!!!!   Best place for brunch!!!!!!!
0,"I don't understand what all the hype is about this place. \nMy first experience here, I did not do the all-you-can-eat, but the rolls and sashimi I ordered were just awful. Everything I ordered came warm and sticky, like it had been sitting out for a while. I gave this place a second chance when I went with my man and some friends, and it wasn't any better. \n\nMajor disappointment after all the good things I had heard.\n\nIf I could rate this place a zero, I sure would."
0,"The food is good, but the service is Horrible, had to wait 20 min just for someone to tell that we needed to order and that's after my girlfriend waved someone down like an SOS on the freeway, I never got a refill at all on my iced tea!!\nWill never go there again!!"
0,I went there for dinner one evening last week with some friends. We all thought our food was very good and the service was fine. My only complaint is that I parked in a public parking garage off of Mill Ave and brought my ticket to the restaurant to be validated. I just assumed that all business do that for their customers. I was wrong. Cafe Boa does not validate parking.  I had to pay $6.00 to park my car which I wasn't prepared for. Way to encourage customers to patronize your business! t
1,"Went there late night, after 2pm. Crowd was good and it was packed. Place is small though. Music was decent and had a good time. I think it's probably better earlier in the night but who knows. Would check it out again during prime hours."
0,"If I could choose no stars for this place I would. The only thing that was decent was the waitress. She was super sweet. \nFirst, I have never had fish and chips that was not edible. Until now that is. The grease was literally pooled on my plate. Even after soaking it up with a napkin it was swimming. I cut into it and the fish wasn't even cooked. Gross\nMy friend ordered the pot roast. One bite and she was done. I think her words were something akin to \""dog food.\"" \nIf this wasn't bad enough, we actually got charged for this crap. Don't waste your time with this place. I certainly won't."

0,"I have had facials and pedicure/manicures here.  The services are fine...actually probably the best pedi ever.  However, they are late pretty much every time.  And not just a few minutes late, either.  I mean 10-15 minutes or more!  This last time, over 30 minutes late!!!  I am not exaggerating, either!  I feel this means they don't really value their customers and this last visit is the last time I will ever visit Re."
0,"I enjoy most Zipps locations but this one has the worst management of all of all Zipps. Truly rude and definitely incompetent. Food is greasy and cheap but a decent place to watch the game over a drink with friends, however there are too many other options around here to waste your time and money at this place."
1,"I'm not a big burger person, but I like how they make your burger to order. I love how they let you pick your toppings..a big plus for us. Their fries are amazing! Love the seasonings that they put on them. We always order the small fries and share as they give you so much!! \n\nThis location is always so clean. Bathrooms are also clean and well stocked. Tables clean, and when someone leaves, one of the workers comes over and wipes it down."
1,"Me and my wife are both picky eaters and very picky when it comes to service.  I have to admit that I had my doubts about this place before we stepped through the door.  Inside the decor is simple and easy on the eyes. About 6 TVs around the walls, that might seem extreme but while eating the whole atmosphere felt like home to me.  The waitress Gail had a pleasant upbeat attitude and a genuine passion for the food and the culture even though she wasn't Peruvian. Now the food was incredible, me and my wife both had Seco de Carne which is slow cooked beef with Peruvian beans and rice.  Very delicious and a definite favorite for me and my wife.  We will continue to dine at this restaurant to try new foods and flavors. I am very glad we visited this place as it is a new favorite for us and I do recommend Inka Grill."
0,"Take your money to Texas De Brazil...the food, ambiance, and service is ten-folds better there. We only dined here because we had a coupon for 'buy one get one free'.  Having had used the coupon, we still felt a little ripped off for what we paid. The food was bland and overly salty.  The selection at the salad bar was not really a selection at all. We paid extra to get seafood along with our dinners, but the only thing we sort-of liked was the skewered shrimps. Don't spring for the unlimited seafood and churrascaria,..the seafood is not worth the extra money at all.  Our waiter was non-attentive, we actually had to flag him down to get our check and have him take our payment.  \nI would've been upset if we did not have our 'buy one get one free' coupon. Take your money to Todai next door....although I have not tried this Todai...I still think it would be a better bet than Pampas. It was not worth the money at all."
0,"********WARNING PET OWNERS************\n\n\nI brought my Shih Tzu in Wed. His neck was pink. By Thursday it was yellow, scabby and infected. THEY BURNT HIS NECK!! Either with the razor or the hair dryer or a combination of both tools. In the EIGHT years my dog has been groomed I have NEVER had an issue with this sort of situation. I am beyond upset. I left a voicemail and I am awaiting a call tomorrow from them. If he needs antibiotics and gets an infection, they will be paying for this vet bill. I see that YESTERDAY someone named Jamie C. left the same kind of review about burns. I also trusted their \""great\"" reviews but BE WARNED DO NOT BRING YOUR DOGS TO THIS GROOMER!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n***********PLEASE SEE PICTURE ATTACHED************\nthis happened at the groomers yesterday and his face is also so red around his nose.\n\nSo far my Doxie seems ok... but if I see any kind of expression issues and she is hurt.... I will make sure they get that vet bill as well. \n\nI was wondering why there was blood on my comforter this morning.. I checked their paws thinking it was the nails but NEVER thought to look under his NECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI will NOT tolerate this kind of business. These are people's pets, Elite - You cannot be rushing a grooming job and burning, cutting and scraping up people's pets.

1,"Easily my fave hangout bar in Noda. \n\nThe location is easy enough even my friends from Ballantyne don't need to call or text me multiple times asking how to find it: corner of 36th & North Davidson. If The Evening Muse is to your left, this place is to your right; if you're passing by Smelly Cat and The Neighborhood Theatre, it's right past the traffic light. \n\nStreet parking can be tricky if there are multiple events going on in NoDa so pls read posted signs and be mindful of residential streets and/or parking lots reserved for particular businesses. There's a gravel lot behind The Neighborhood Theatre that almost always has a parking attendant ensuring the safety of your vehicle for a paltry $5. Make use of it. \n\nBack to The Blind Pig. It's just so up this kitschy gal's alley. Walk in and look to the left - foozball table. Keep walking. A few arcade-style video games. Skeeball. Pool tables. Dartboard. Make way to the bar. See list of tasty libations on special. Take advantage of full bar. Mosey around the bar area. Smile when you discover many awesome table and board games, such as: Connect Four, Battleship, Jenga, Mr. Potatohead, Lincoln Logs, and the list goes on! Play beer pong. Mingle outside on the patio area (smaller than Solstice's but accommodates a dozen or so ppl easily). Enjoy the music or the karaoke that's going on.  Smile at someone you don't know. Have fun!"
0,"Came here because Discount Tire was having a Employee Appreciation day a couple of months ago.  Walk in and ask for 4 tires, and also ask if there are any discounts going on at the time.  Guy says no deals going on, but while he is quoting my price I passively check bigo's website on my iPhone and whaddya know? There was a $75 off deal going on when you buy 4 tires.  I point it out to the guy and he immediately cuts the price.  Slime.  I should have left then and there, but it gets worse.  He Quotes me a time of 45min - 1hr.  I sit in the waiting room from the 1980's for about 1 hr and check on my car.  They hadn't even started yet.  Frustrated, I went for a walk around the block to starbucks and back.  When I came back I sat down in the parking lot to watch the tech work on my car.  After finally getting around to my car the tech began to unscrew the tires with reckless abandon and dropping the tires on the ground so that the rims were parallel to the ground!  Saw me looking at him and took a little more care with the rest, but the damage was done.  A couple of minutes later the manager calls me over and tells me that they \""found\"" the TPMS sensor cracked in half inside of my tire, makes up some crazy lie about how the sensor would still be working because it was rolling around in the tire.  (BS)  I had no tire light when I came to the shop, but left with one.  btw the sensor was $250 dollars.  Of course the crooks did not offer to replace it but stuck with their story of \""finding it\"" that way.  \n\nSo...\n\nGot 4 new tires\n\nwasted 4 hrs\nand spent extra $250 on tire sensor\n\nAVOID and go to discount tire"
0,The attitude of these guys sucks
1,"Five stars because of the variety + creativity. Whether searching for soaps, quirky games, common sense, joke, or unordinary books, erotic fantasy, dog treats, baby/babyshower presents, or you name it stuff, they've got it. \n\nThe staff is nice, approachable. I broke a frame (accidentally, of course) and he didn't hit me when I brought it to the register and confessed. That was nice too. \n\nThe place is big. What could've been three large rooms they've decked out kind of maze-like. On a busy day you might be squezzing to get through - and it's worth it. It may keep you busy for a bit unless you know what you want. For the creative at heart and those searching for gifts with wrapping included, this is the place to go."
0,"\""Excuse me waiter. What's this fly doing in my soup?\"" \n\""It appears to be doing the backstroke sir.\"" \n\nYep. This pretty much sums up our service at MB this past Sunday. Forgotten entrees. No ice bucket for the champagne. Drinks took forever, if indeed, they were remembered. Ketchup? Our beniets? Ugh! \n\nFormerly the FoodBar (remember that place, with the awful layout and crazy ordering procedure?), MB is a lovely French restaurant in the heart of Oldtown. We sat inside, luckily, as some Gen X Jewel type performer was on the patio \""singing\"" and strumming her guitar. I heard just a few bars and wanted to stab my eye out with a hot fork. Fortunately the hustle and bustle inside perfectly drowned it out! \n\nThe food was quite good. Not incredible. Beniets were undercooked a bit, but hey, we scarfed them down anyway. My eggs Benedict was fantastic; served with biscuits instead of English muffins. But no potatoes. No salad. No nothing on the side. Not even a garnish. Others seemed pleased with a burger, granola and an all American breakfast. \n\nChristine is right however, in that we were there to celebrate a birthday. Too bad much of our energy was used to flag down ANYONE who could help us. I swear I almost asked the lady sitting next to us to refill Rickie's coffee. God that would have been fun! \n\nSo I can't say oui oui to MB quite yet. And for now I shall just say ta ta!"
1,"I've ordered pizza for carryout a couple times here since I moved here. Haven't had any problems with service or the food.\nA couple weeks ago when some friends were visiting from out of town. We wanted to find something fast at night to eat and we could take back to the hotel. We decided to order online via a friend's phone on our way out after watching MNF on the strip.\nSo, while we were picking up the pizza. One of my friends had to use the bathroom really, really badly and we couldn't find anything open in that strip mall(it was near closing). Even though he didn't have to, the manager was nice enough to let her use their employee bathroom so she wouldn't have to pee right in their lobby."
0,This place has become a real joke over the past couple years. Worse service anywhere. They just can't handle it anymore with the immigration crack down.. The food is hit and miss anyway...Never again.
0,"This is an interesting museum.  It definitely has a great variety of musical instruments from many countries, and mostly of older eras, with musical content you hear by way of headphones.\n\nIt's extremely educational, and will take most of a day to fully tour.\n\nThe downside I experienced was that a large group of school children came for a tour - which is great - but they were extremely noisy and one couldn't hear the music content on the headphones.  The museum was unusable for the 1.5-2 hours the children were present.\n\nMy advice is if you are planning to visit this museum, call ahead and see if there will be any groups like this when you may visit.  Plan your visit around them and you won't have a major distraction."
1,"I know Fuel is predominately a pizza joint, but as much as I love their pizza, the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wings. There are a few staples that one needs in life and for me a need for crispy, hot buffalo wings, drenched in cool ranch dressing, is a craving that hits me often. I will search high and low to find the perfect wings and thankfully, they can be delivered to my doorstep by Fuel (no matter what time it is). \n\nTheir wings have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin. They offer a variety of sauces, but my favorite is the classic hot. Some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste, but I think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat, but not too much to leave me hurting. I love to order my wings extra crispy, because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the wing.  \n\nI can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wings to get a little extra attention (more specifically, some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese) sometimes, but Fuel always puts up with my requests. They even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customize your order to be \""all celery\"" or vice versa. \n\nI prefer to eat in when ordering wings, because they fry the wings upon ordering and I am ready and waiting to get my hands on them, but on a lazy Sunday (or late Saturday night) I will request a delivery of my order. My only complaint is that the Styrofoam boxes that the wings are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the crispiness of the wings. If they could poke holes in the top of the box to let the wings breathe, life would be just perfect. \n\nI dare you to find a better wing in Charlotte."
1,"My friend and I went last night to Bombay Grille. We started with samosa (she ordered and oh boy what a good choice). They are very filling and come as two big pieces. I ordered chicken palak. It's quite tasty but a little spicy for my taste. Next time note to self to order only #2. Luckily, the waiter was very prompt in refilling my drink. The garlic naan was sooo yummy! I can eat that for dinner with the sauce of Chicken Palak. I wish this place only 10 minutes away from my home..."
1,"Enjoy a simple breakfast with good service? this is your place. \n\nThis place has good service, good food and prices are fair. The bakery is full of wonderful delights and with up coming holidays, you might want to put in your special order, like strawberry rhubard pie!\n\nToday I had three scrabbled, bacon with country potatos and a rasian bagel with plain cream cheese. It' s plain. Simple and always works for me! \n\nThey have a full menu and their sandwiches are excellent! Always a real treat to dine in here."
1,Great Beer selection and decent food.
1,"I like where the hotel is located as it's short drive from things like Taliesin West, the TPC Scottsdale Golf Course, the Waterfront, and Old Town; you have tons of restaurants within walking distance (Capital Grille to In 'n Burger or my first stop in Scottsdale, Oregano's at the corner of N. Scottsdale and Shea - short drive, don't walk that one) and plenty o' shopping including Kierland Commons, the high end open air mall, about a 1/2 mile away. A quick right out of the parking lot leads you to the 101 loop and all of the surrounding area.\n\nThe big blue Frank Lloyd Wright spire across the street is a great way to find your way home (the hotel is kinda hidden behind a Carraba's and an office building and easy to miss when driving). On weekends, go out to the pool around 9:00 PM and catch the fireworks from the Paradise resort behind you.\n\nThe hotel itself is clean with large rooms that contain a comfortable seating area, a decent sized desk for working, and a separate 2 seat table for meals. The swiveling flat screen is visible no matter where you plop down. There's no oven in the kitchen but who cares? When I'm traveling I am reheating not cooking meals. The microwave gets the job done. They'll shop for you if you make a list and the laundry's up on the second floor if you packed light and need clean clothes.\n\nThe staff is friendly and efficient. The little Marketplace in the lobby stocks pints of Haagen-Dazs and Milky Ways -- what else do you need?\n\nA great place to stay whether it's a business trip or a mini-vaca with Honey Bunny and the Boy."
1,I love this Starbucks for its convenience. It's right next to the 95 for my commute to Hendertucky and the drive thru is not ever that busy when I go.
0,"Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nGood and cheap Mexican food absolutely must be inclusive in order to work.  Here it's just barely.  Saying that, I still decided to go more than once.\n\nFirst go was on a weekend when they make Menudo.  This is a dish that will usually either scare me from future visits or endear the place to me.  For the first time ever: all I could say about it was, \""meh.\""  Apparently there is a variation of Menudo that's neither great nor horrible.  The tripe was tender and for the most part trimmed well.  The broth was definitely lacking some flavor, but not that a few additions didn't remedy it sufficiently.  My biggest issue was that probably a good third of my order was taken up by one of their stewing bones that just happened to get scooped in there.  It can happen, but this one was too big to be entirely negligence.\n\nSecond go involved two tacos.  I like to pit a place's carnitas versus adobada to see which one I prefer of theirs.  For the record, their adobada won this battle.  Really, in my experience, I haven't seen many places with the skill to screw up either of these.  Both were quite tastey, but the portions I'm used to were slightly lacking.  I guess I've been spoiled by places that have made me wonder if there was a tortilla under there.  They didn't just skimp on the meat though, but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.\n\nA special note will go to their pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention, and truth be told, I almost missed out.  On my first visit, someone, noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu, deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.\n\nAn all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best, and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way, it's all pretty decent."
1,Love the salon but more so love Trini. He has fixed my hair and love the transitions my hair takes between my appointments! Plus the hair massages during the hair washes are amazing!
1,"I am fan. We finally went here after many years of just driving by. It is not very impressive by the look of it, but the food is really good. Order the Posada items, they are really yummy. The service is good. the salsa is really good. We will go back again. The price is right."
0,"These two stars sum up my experience - \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" The prices are very reasonable, we were actually stunned at a burger and fries under $7! But I'm assuming the quality of the food determines the low prices. We weren't too impressed. It was okay, I wasn't unhappy by any means, but I don't think I'll come back."

0,"Very rude! Called to speak to her regarding leaving my dogs there for a couple days while I was in the Scottsdale area. She did not ask any questions, just immediately said no, it would be too much of a disruption for her. I was willing to bring my dogs in for a meet and greet and she still said it was too much work. I would think someone would be very pleasant to a possible new customer, but she was completely the opposite. I come to the Scottsdale area 3-4 times a year, so that could have been some extra business for her. Do not recommend, would not want to inconvenience her to take care of my dogs., despite the fact that that is her business."

0,"Oh my God KEEP IT!\nBUMMER TOWN, USA\n\nIf you're looking for the place you saw on TV, do yourself a favor find somewhere else to eat.

Yeah great, other than that, heart attack grill kinda blows. \n\nList of things you're not allowed to do (seriously):\nShare a burger with a friend\nDrink water\nTell your waitress how you want your burger\nTake off the gown\n\nI guess I'll start with the burgers: totally not good. Unseasoned beef, stale bread roll,  bacon that was cooked an hour before you even showed up. NO fixings...not even lettuce/tomato/pickles or regular onions just ketchup mustard and mayonnaise.  \n\nThe fries: I'm all for junk food and all but these fries that are supposedly fried in lard were laaaaaaame. It was a nice little basket of soggy and burnt (which I though was impossible to do) fries. \n\nShake: got the chocolate one. I guess it's funny to have the \""worlds most fattening shake\"" on the menu...but any dork could throw a stick of butter in a chocolate malt. Imagine sippin' on movie theater butter and melted chocolate. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm all for over indulgence, but heart attack grill is so dirt. Its not even funny, it's just kinda sad and depressing. Save that Vegas money for something else.\n\n If this didn't convince you that this place BUMMER FEST 2011... \n\nI suggest you read Ruben's review."
0,"What a pity, great store but incredibly lousy customer service. \nWe had an issue and the manager was called and was unbelievably rude.\nI sent a comment and someone by the name of Bill H. defended her attitude as following company policy, a portion of his response below.\n\n\""My manager was not trying to be \""quite rude\"" but only following company policy and doing her job\"". \n\nWe also asked for some help in the wine area and wow this person chased us to Total Wine.

0,"Heard about Los Olivos from a friend who had been to the original one. They had nothing but good things to say so we decided to check it out. \n\nNothing about this place impressed me. The food was average at best and the service was terrible. We had ordered margaritas and I guess the waitress forgot to bring them buy. When we had asked for them again she told us she forgot and that it was just sitting at the bar so she would be right back. I was surprised when she brought it back because most of the ice was already melted, I figured she would bring us a fresh one but I was wrong. She didn't seem to care when I mentioned how my frozen margarita was now a lukewarm margarita.\n\nThat being said, I can put up with bad service at a restaurant when the food is good but I have had better Mexican at Taco Bell. The only reason I am giving two stars is because it was at least decently priced."

It gets past 8 and then we're told that it's not gonna happen until 8:30 because there was still some light in the sky. LAME.\n\nSo we came back at 8:30 and the show lasted literally 3 minutes.  It was a giant frog that sang \""What a Wonderful World\"" on top of the fake waterfall.  It was pretty cool, but I was expecting the show to last longer.\n\nThen we came again at 9 to check out the second show (there's 2 different shows each night, we were told), and it BROKE DOWN! There were these two balls that were circling around the pond (kind of boring), and in the middle of the show the lights went out and the song stopped. \n\nThis show definitely cannot compete with the other free shows on the strip.  Go see the Bellagio fountains instead."
1,I went on Thursday and it was 7 dollar medium cheese. Coming from Chicago I was skeptical but the pizza was delicious. The crust was good and it was even good cold later. The waitress was really nice. The only problem was the rif raf that came in. Crowd was somewhat trashy. I would go back if I was in Pitt again.
0,"Unbelievably slow! There were 2 people waiting outside & 4 inside all waiting on food. After waiting 5 minutes @ counter I finally got someone to come take my order, 2 slices & a drink, \""grab & go special\"". No truth to the name. Waited 15 more minutes for slices. When I left, guy outside was coming in to cancel his order. Lady he was with already had eaten & he still didn't have his sub. Also I ordered to go but they gave it to me on a plate not in a box. Definitely wouldn't go back."
0,"I call BS on these rave reviews.  They sound really scripted and phony.  Carolina's is just your usual dumpy Filiberto's-ish place and you simply either like it or you don't.  The same way you might feel about one of those other polarizing institutions, Chico's Tacos in El Paso.  Even the people who like Chico's Tacos will admit it really isn't that good.  But if you claim this is \""the best Mexican food anywhere\"" or \""so so good\"" (right out of a commercial script) or \""fantastic Mexican food\"", your credibility takes a nose dive.  This has the appearance of \""stuffing the ballot box\"", and something's fishy here.  Even within the bounds of dumpy Mexican food joints, this place doesn't even meet mediocre standards.\n\nThe food in detail:\n\nCombo plate with tostada, taco and enchilada on my first visit:  taco... passable.  Which incredibly made it the star of the combo plate.  The enchilada was a formless mass of tortilla resembling something you scooped out of a casserole with some institutional enchilada sauce over it and no detectable filling.  Total amateur hour.  The tostada was like something spawned from an Ortega or Old El Paso kit and probably would have bored Midwestern Mexican food neophytes from Iowa.  A school cafeteria could have matched the quality. I can't even remember the rice and beans, I was so stunned how bad the main items were.  The cherry on the sundae was how severely pissed my wife was at me that I suggested we try this place.  Can't say I blame her, really.  It doesn't take a gastronome to see that this place serves up some really nasty food.\n\nThe green chile burro I had during my ill-advised second try here was a bigger disaster than the first experience.  It felt like I was holding a water balloon.  That's because it was filled with a gray, soupy, gravy-like, watery substance that had chunks of, well... nothing... in it.  It was like a folded tortilla soup bowl that gushed all over the place when I took a bite.  And it tasted like it looked.  Hands down the worst burro of any type I've ever had anywhere.  Honestly, I've had way better burritos from Taco Bell, of all places.  Needless to say I didn't finish it and it went into the garbage with extreme prejudice.  \n\nI sure would appreciate a few more honest reviews here instead of people shilling for this dump.  Don't believe a word of anything positive you read here.  I've never hated any eating establishment like I hate Carolina's.  Not even MacDonald's.  At least people aren't heaping undeserved praise on MacDonald's.  This place doesn't deserve another thin dime from me."
0,"I'm so sick of this place screwing up orders! I stopped going there for over 6mo for just this reason...figured if I stopped by now, surely they have new staff, management, etc. and possibly the food and service quality has improved. I was WRONG. C'mon folks, it's fast food, for goodness sakes...   Jack has standard operating procedures; you make the burgers this way, you fry potatoes this way, (and you throw them out if they've been sitting in the warmer for over an hour, for goodness sakes) *face palm*\n\nThe buns used in this JIB always seem \""day old\"", the fries are NEVER fresh, the letuce sems consistently wilted, and to top it all off - the right food doesn't ever make it into the bag! \nI give up, no more for me, store is right around the corner from my home but I will drive 4extra miles to a different JIB."
1,"We ordered delivery for the first time from this restaurant last week and it was great!  You can do all of your ordering online which I thought was super helpful - and - they delivered until 10pm!!. \n\nWe had the sweet and sour chicken (5/5), chicken with cashew nuts (5/5), curry chicken with onions (4/5) and spring rolls (3/5).  The rice came with each of the main dishes and was delicious!  The curry did not taste milky-ish as I have become accustomed to and enjoy, but instead was on the watery side and had a lot of bell pepper flavor. Overall good and I will definitely be back in person!"
1,"Amazing!! The man working the counter really knew about the business and it made my experience better. I was curious about the gelato \""spaghetti\"" dessert and he suggested to make it \""his\"" way. Which was absolutely delicious! I'll definitely be going back."
1,"Once again there was no wait to get seated at the bar since I was dining alone (one of the perks of traveling alone). One of my friends had recommended I give Holsteins a try because of their boozy adult shakes and floats. Yum, who can resist! \n\nI gave the brown cow a try - an adult version of a root beer float with whipped cream vodka in it, yummy! For dinner I started to ask the bartender which of 3 different burgers was the best and the first I mentioned was \""the Gold Standard\"" and before I could continue he said \""The Gold Standard\""! I said \""really? better than the Nom Nom Burger (with kobe beef) and he said \""yes!\"". Well that made my decision pretty easy, the Gold standard it is. \n\nWow, what a delicious burger! I loved the combination of tomato confit, and the goat cheddar cheese, and of course bacon makes everything better! I substituted regular fries for sweet potato fries, which were so crispy and delicious I could have eaten them all night!"
0,"I want to give places the benefit of the doubt. Especially ones that have positive reviews, have been recommended by locals and have been around awhile even with heavy competition close by and a fairly pricey menu. So when our first round of drinks took 15 minutes to arrive, and our old fashioned was made incorrectly (a place like this with an expansive bar should know how to make an old fashioned, yes?), I reminded myself that the food was supposed to be awesome. We were on vacation, with good friends and were prepared to have a great evening so I really was not looking to spoil it for myself. \n\nAnd then our waiter opened his mouth. I asked for some explanation of menu items, many of which had either no explanation or description or was a puzzling mess of adjectives and much-too-hip-and-cool titles.  When asked for some help to decipher parts of the menu that - while it appeared to be in English - might as well have been written in a foreign language, our waiter started in with a host of racist remarks - like maybe he could find his Vietnamese friend to interpret for me, or go get me some dim sum instead. When I didn't laugh, he asked what I wanted an explanation of but I was so over it. He returned to the table after a few minutes, likely feeling slightly remorseful about his inappropriate comments (or more likely trying to resurrect his shrinking tip potential) and started rattling off at 100mph a verbal dissertation of a few menu items. No one at our table could understand much of what he said. I guess he was having a bad night and unfortunately it did rub off some on us. One bright star was the manager who came by to drop off a list of breakfast and lunch places he wanted to recommend after having had a conversation about this with our friends before our arrival. We did not mention our waiter - no one wanted to have a negative conversation and further spoil what was supposed to be a fun evening.  \n\nAs for the food, well, it's hard to be fair given the bitter palate created by the waiter. I had the mini mushroom pan fry (serious potential, but slightly greasy and sadly under salted) and a salad (which was \""fine\""). My husband had the swordfish (butter sauce was yummy), our friends the bison meatloaf and the filet mignon. Both were pretty good. Desserts earned higher praise, allowing me to move Cowboy Ciao up to 2 stars - bread pudding, ice cream trio and the birthday cake were all delicious and a satisfying end to an otherwise disappointing experience. \n\nI would not recommend Cowboy Ciao to anyone visiting the Scottsdale - there are too many fabulous restaurants in this area to waste time with poorly trained staff."
1,"I started going to Salt Cellar years about ten years ago. It has been my favorite restaurant in Arizona. It is disappointing to see all of the bad reviews on here, because my experience has always been great. The king crab legs are my favorite thing on the menu, besides the shrimp San Remo appetizer which is a must have! I will say, the prices have increased dramatically, so I have not been back in quite some time for dinner. I always start at the bar, and then sit down for dinner. I would go more often and sit at the bar for a drink, appetizer and salad, but you are not allowed to order salad in the bar area. Lou was our favorite bartender for years, and unfortunately he is no longer there. The last time I went, the new bartender was very rude to the people who I was with. I felt embarrassed because they were unhappy with the service, after I just talked the place up. I am guessing over time the inviting atmosphere has changed, and attendtion to detail along with great service has been replaced with making money."
1,"Nothing I could say in this review could possibly convey the amazing experience that we had here at Middle Eastern Bakery & Deli.  This was THE BEST place at which I have eaten in all my visits to Phoenix (off and on annually over the last 10 years) and I will be back (multiple times) every time I visit from now on.\n\nWhy is it that the taste of the food is so often inversely proportionate to the fanciness of the restaurant, at least when it comes to ethnic restaurants?  The fancier the decor in an ethnic restaurant, the blander the food.\n\nStated differently, what is it about the mystical siren's call of the hole in the wall ethnic restaurant?  Does the chef assume that because his food is head and shoulders above the rest that he needn't waste money on decorations?  Or is it simply that the mom & pop chef with his traditional recipes handed down from generation to generation will never be matched by the cookie cutter american culinary school education?\n\nThis restaurant is very unassumedly named The Middle Eastern Bakery and Deli, though it is also a restaurant and grocery store.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, nor the inside, and would probably fly under most people's radar if it was not for word of mouth passed through Yelp.  Can you see the diamond lurking under the layer of carbon?  I sure can.\n\nThe proprietor, Isam (yes, we're on a first name basis now and you will be, too, by the end of your first visit), is quite a character guaranteed to put a smile on the face of even the WORST sourpuss.  Before our first visit we called him by phone to make sure the restaurant would be open when we arrived and he was friendly and welcoming.  When we finally arrived he welcomed us like old friends.  \n\nI ordered the grilled combo and my coworker ordered the Lebanese Chicken.  Both plates came with a choice of Greek Salad of Tabbouli with a fresh warm pita and rice.  I wasn't sure which to choose, so Isam guided me gently toward the Tabbouli which he makes FRESH 5 TIMES EVERY DAY.  Yes, you can tell this man is incredibly gifted in the making of Tabbouli, which is a thing of beauty, colorfully decorated with red and green pepper rings, white couscous, tangy red tomato, crisp white onions, and ruby toned sliced beets over dark greens.  It is beautiful, but tastes even better.  I ordered a diet soda in spite of the prominently displayed Yelp tip recommending the lemonade (\""Your life will change as you discover the super powers you've acquired from the lemonade.\"") as I'm not usually a big lemonade fan.  My coworker ordered the lemonade and I ordered the birds nest baklava with glistening green pistachio pieces covering the top to eat while I waited for the food to arrive.\n\nMy coworker took one sip of the lemonade, which is made with honey and rose water - SHEER GENIUS - and couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was.  I traded him half of my baklava for a taste and couldn't BELIEVE how amazing it was - TRULY LIFE CHANGING.  Isam brought me a large cup of this elixir of the gods and made my entire day.\n\nWhen our meals came I was thrilled with my perfectly seasoned kebabs with three kinds of meat -  chicken, lamb, and spiced ground beef, all of them cooked perfectly and all of them delicious.  The rice was not basmati, more like a pilaf, but was incredibly flavorful.  Alex said his Lebanese Chicken was amazing, but refused to share any with me.\n\nThe owner brought us over a complimentary Turkish coffee, a lemonade, and a pistachio baklava - all amazing!!!  Isam also gave us a lesson in appreciating coffee.  He taught us how to sip it and about his secret ingredient (cardamom).  He grinds his own cardamom fresh from the seeds, which cost $100 per pound and I guarantee you are totally worth the expense.  He showed us both the seeds and the ground versions and let us smell them, pure heaven on Earth.  Isam says that the cardamom works on your nervous system to relax you;  I certainly felt relaxed when I left, but I think some of that might have to do with the owner's charm rather than the coffee.  When we left, we stopped up at the counter to say goodbye to our host, because it just felt more like a family visit than a restaurant visit.  You can just walk out of a restaurant, but you don't walk out on family without saying goodbye.\n\nI made a return visit several days later and not only did Isam remember me, but he came out from behind the counter to give me a hug and asked where my friend was (I had just dropped my coworker off at the airport).  I ordered the Lebanese Chicken and one of his heavenly lemonades.  Isam once again brought me a Turkish Coffee (this stuff is addicting) and a baklava to enjoy with it.  I enjoyed my second visit as much as my first; Isam gave me a menu and invited me to come back again during my visit.  He even gave me his phone number and told me to call if I needed anything.  \n\nI will definitely be back!!\n\n\n\n\n\n Relaxes you, works on your nervous syst"
0,"I would not go back here....EVER! The woman working the door accused my ID of being fake. She asked for a second form of ID. I pulled what I thought was my credit card out of my wallet, however, the bartender at the previous bar gave me the wrong card! Obviously, this did not help my case. I showed her two more credit cards with matching names and asked if I could go back to the previous bar, get my credit card from the bartender, and come back. She said no and threatened to call the police! I told her that was fine with me (I had nothing to hide). Instead, she called her manager over to look at my ID. He sided with her and told me that even if I came back with my credit card, I could not come in because \""you called my employee a B*#$@.\"" I was SO taken aback, because I was not intoxicated and would remember if I called her that name, which I absolutely DID NOT. My friends and I left and went to a different bar. I understand this establishment probably deals with fakes very frequently, but I was extremely disappointed that they were so rude; it was uncalled for. Do not plan any parties here, because you aren't guaranteed that everyone will get in."
0,"I ordered a simple stack of pancakes. OMG, they had no flavor and felt like they were previously frozen. How hard is it to make a good pancake! Even the pancakes at McDonalds taste better than these. The syrup was very runny and also had no flavor. I was so hungry I tried to eat them but became nauseated. The coffee was 3.99 a cup and no one offered to fill it and it was not that good either. The servers were arguing about breaks, really? Fill my coffee and stop arguing! Never again and will tell others not to waste their money."
0,"Came in on a Saturday night......bad idea! I was just ordering food to go, so it shouldn't have been too bad. I ordered 2 pupusas....just 2! (And a small horchata) \n\nGuess how long I had to wait....\n\n50 whole minutes! \n\nFIFTY MINUTES! For 2 little pupusas! \n\nThe lady who took my order would periodically look at me and she didn't speak a word to me. No reassurance that my food was on its way. I thought they forgot about my order. On top of that, after she gave me my food, I had to ask for my horchata. She asked me \""what size\""? She should have at least upgraded me to a large because of the long wait and for forgetting to give me my drink all together! Plus, I had to wait another 5 minutes to even get my drink! Ridiculous!!! \n\nThe pupusas were ok....not worth waiting that long, especially by myself!"
1,"Finally got to try this place after seeing it on Check Please AZ. We got the dunkin catfish, crab Landry and alligator combo. The fried catfish was a bit too salty for me but the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e was pretty good. The alligator came in small pieces like popcorn chicken. Good flavor but wish they did bigger chunks like pappadeux. \nThe crab Landry was really good. Lots of real crab in it. Their potatoe salad was pretty good and I'm not one to like it usually. Tasted homemade with their own seasonings so flavor was good. Interestingly enough their side salad was good hearty greens and not that iceberg junk so I thought that was impressive that they spend the extra money for it. \nTheir sweet tea was really good. I don't like mine super sweet and I think they did a good job of that. Even better was that I asked for a to-go cup to pour the rest in and the waiter got me two new cups!  One with ice and one without ice to enjoy later.  Since it was the end of the day they were going to throw the rest away anyways but the fact that he thought to give me one w/o ice for later was ingenious! \nWhen I can't go to Louisiana, this is a great sub to satisfy those cravings."
1,"Wow. The number of flavors of gelato That's Amore offers is truly impressive -- and all of it is delicious and made in-house! There are pastries and coffee, too. I got a kick out of seeing the gelato cake designs offered, as well. It's a good thing we don't live here -- we would come every day!"
0,"The wait staff is horrible. Waited 5 minutes before I was even acknowledged. When I chose to sit outside ( the only place there was an available table), I sat for another 10 minutes before anyone came to my table, and that was only because they saw me get up to leave. Very disappointed. I was really looking forward to trying this place."
1,Hands down the best record store I've been to in the 21st century.  Something i thought I would never see again has come back to life. The selection of new vinyl is staggering and a sight to behold. A truly impressive sight to see and worth the trip.
1,"This place is awesome. Everything is so professional yet quirky and I love it. I could spend like 30 minutes reading the menu because of all the little hidden jokes on it... including their continuously updated plea never to touch their blinds (which, you totally should when they aren't looking, because they are made of cool beads!). \n\nThe sushi is all fresh and tasty and very cheap during happy hour (10% off everything, 50% off some rolls). \n\nI am not saying you should mention the word underground to your server but I am not saying you shouldn't either, and if you do you may be rewarded with very delicious menu options..."
0,"This was one of the worst experience's I've had! Customer service was horrible, since I cannot leave the rating zero, I am forced to give them a one, but believe me I wouldn't go back if it was free!  \n\nLet me explain, we walked in for a hot bowl of noodles, and the place had maybe 8 tables of people.  We were shown a table and sat down, and that was it, no one came over to take our order, we were there maybe 10 minutes when a bus load of people came flooding through the doors and scrambling for free tables, they were placing orders and their food came flying out, one after another, it was horrific.  I finally got someones attention and they took our order.  \n\nFinally, our food came out but they kept pushing us around, first by asking that we move to a single table, we had been seated by them at a table for four, so we complied, then when my husband made his way to the counter to pay, I was still slurping my noodles, they showed people to sit at our table, I wasn't even done eating and they were pushing us out to make room for 'THE BUS' people.  I have never felt so unwanted, I was a paying customer too!  I wanted to sit and enjoy my meal, and yet I was rushed, pushed out of my seat!\n\nI couldn't take it any more, I was livid, so I walked out, disgusted with the whole experience, and I will not go back!"
0,"I know I am picky about my Mexican tastebuds, and I just cannot find much food I love here. I am Southwest Spoiled.\n\nI am sure this is a great place for those who adore tequila more than me but it really is more of a fancy booze place then a great restaurant. \n\nThe prices seem great until you see your smaller portions then at that rate you need to order more food. We tried the double guac app which came with a little pork belly. The pork belly was great but one of the guacs was swapped in over salty queso cheese and honestly it was borderline gross. Way too much salt packed into a little punch not enough fresh garlic or lime or cilantro flavors in their guac. \n\nI ordered the chicken enchiladas they were new American style meaning not baked they used corn tortillas (not a great choice if you love soft enchiladas. Their was some odd white sauce with the chicken which was nicely cooked, very tender. The rice was overly bland and beans were just ok. In short I doused the thing in Cholula and longed for my own mole pulled pork enchiladas. \n\nThe drinks: we had mojitos the first ones were good the second had way too much lime juice. I guess as the night wore on less care was taken. I could say the same for our waiter he was very attentive until after our appetizer came then we barely saw him. \n\nThe positives its a very nice space to eat in, we were able to be seated on a feb sat night within a half hour. But next year I'll be sticking to my first choice for a birthday dinner. If you're wanting authentic flavors you won't find them here more new american mexican. I think with a little help this place could be great but it is just isn't."
1,i went here the other night for the first time with a date. i am pretty blown away! i had a glass of the caramel road chardonnay.. which was AMAZING!! and i got the fettuccine Alfredo.. it was honestly the best fettuccine Alfredo i have ever had! they also have this table side salad service where they make the salad in front of you and ask what you want in it which was also superb. will be coming back here and telling friends and family about this great little treasure!! oh by the way our server was GREAT too. I forget his name (very bad with names). highly recommended!
0,"Well after a few months since my previous review I did return and things have not changed one bit. The silver age, war and horror (old school subjects, from the 60s/70s) drawers are still empty. I collect silver age, but I don't have a specific item that I am looking for, I basically browse the drawers and if a cover appeals to me I buy it. To me not having a structure in my collecting makes it more fun, I don't need to complete a full run and any random book or subject is just fine with me. The cover art is what I am mostly looking for (since 90% of the time the story in the book lets you down in relation to the exciting cover art). I really liked it when they had several drawers full of silver age that I could concentrate on and they were located in one place towards the beginning of the line of drawers. Now you can find silver age, but they are mixed into all the other hundreds of subjects and those drawers are so full you can't even look through them without removing a huge stack so you can take a look. Some drawers are so tight, you can't even remove some to make room, other drawers are packed so loose that the books are falling over damaging other books and folding them.\nI did manage to find a few items that totalled about $15, but when I checked out, again no mention of the rewards program. Again this is a sticking point with me, since for all the years I was buying there it was at about the $250 in total purchases that I was finally offered a card for the rewards program. Ugh!"
1,"The staff was lovely, and although the paintwork is garish and the seats are uncomfortable, it was a surprisingly cozy restaurant.  Nice selection of specialty sodas which is fun.  I had the chicken wrap with fries and it was delicious.  The chicken was moist and the sauce was wonderful.  The fries were to die for.  I got the specialty custard pastry for desert and it was delightful.  Downtown Sun Prairie is small, but nice and there were some cute shops I would like to visit when I have more time."
0,"Wasn't clear when booking through orbits that \""carry on was smaller than normal so you end up getting charged $100-$200 dollars more if you're bringing a carry on. It was $209 for the plane ticket and $150 for the carry on.  Bringing my flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to $359. I could have gone across the country for that price. Not too big of a deal except I was paying for two.  I could have flown for $230 southwest and had free snacks, and a free carry on.  I wish it would have been more clear that there is no \""free carry on\""  just a free \""free small personal item\""  Which they call a \""free carry on personal item\"" when buying the ticket.  \n\nThe main problem was in the Vegas terminal they trick you by showing you a free box, that is almost the size of a regular carry on.    So you think oh cool maybe I don't have to pay $50 for this thing.  Then at the gate they're like nope doesn't fit so it's now $100 literally 25 minutes later.  Wow you got me Spirit.  Times that by two cause my GF was flying with me and I just got had for $100 bucks.  Pretty funny right? \n\nAbout 7 other people also made the same mistake.  When asked if they could just pay the $50 instead of the $100 because they were just offered the $50 dollar \""deal\"" 20 minutes prior at the check in, as was I.  They were like \""nope you can ditch your bags, buy a smaller bag and stuff all your belongings in them and hope it fits into the \""free carry on box, or pay the $100 fee.\""  Those were the hard and fast choices provided to a bunch of very unhappy people.\n\nWhen the plane closed it's door and everyone was seated and the announcer said \""Welcome to Spirt Airlines.\""  It was literally met with a crowd of boos.  That is not an exaggeration. I of course chimed in.\n\nAll that being said had I not had a carry on, I wouldn't have minded the flight.  There was actually nothing wrong with service, the people are actually happier on this airline than on others for some odd reason.  Probably because they don't have to work as hard, because they aren't handing out free drinks all day.  Just a quick walk down the isle to see who's buying - On this flight maybe 5 takers. There was a definite hostility lingering in the air from people feeling raped by extortionist tactics, but if you can get past that, then the one hour flight to LA from Vegas was relatively painless.\n\nAnother note the flight there to Vegas from LA, where I paid at the check in for the bags and later thought that I didn't need to because they didn't seem to check for my receipt for the baggage payment, then was humbled in Vegas for my stupidity - Well on that flight we waited an hour on the tarmac for the flight to take off because of \""Weather to the east between LA and Vegas.\""  When we finally got cleared for take off via a route around the \""weather\"" (in August in California there is no \""weather\"", and the weather satellite agreed on my Iphone - no weather) Spirit doesn't put enough gas in for longer route to Vegas so we had to, after waiting an hour, go back to the gate to refuel, this caused 8 people on the flight to miss a connection to Chicago.\n\nDon't ever think they aren't checking if you paid your carry on fee. They absolutely do check. They had a code that says Zone 1 when you pay for a carry on.  They tell you this when you don't pay. It's not very obvious when you do. You kinda think hey maybe they don't check because it's so ridiculous to ask $100 for a carry on that the employees let it slide.  I really think this is on purpose to make you think you were crazy for paying $50 for a carry on for a one hour flight, then try not doing it and get caught for the $100 at the gate carry on fee.  So funny but so not at the same time.  \n\nHere's the sad part.  Spirt Airlines is one of the most profitable airlines in the world today. Since the 2011 IPO  the stock price is up over 400%.  It seems this may be the future model of air travel. \n\nSpirit Airlines was offering something like 15000 real miles of air travel for signing up for their Master Card on the flight back. The deal seemed too good to be true. If they are very profitable, then all I could think about this offer was how they could make a profit on all the \""free travel.\""  Then I realized I was offered a \""free carry on personal item: when I bought my ticket.\""  They play with words when they do their sales and promotion and it's designed to make you lose money and blame yourself because you didn't read the small print.  It's a hostile form of customer relations. And is the source of their title of \""Worst.\"""
1,"I just went there with 4 co-workers for lunch.  Everybody was happy with their food, which was: pizza, Stromboli (yummy) and calzones (huge).  The staff was friendly and the prices are fair.\n\nThe only negative is a lack of seating.  Just note in advance that there is only counter seating inside.  This would be a great place to grab something to go."
0,"What a shit hole! Came here for a drink and a burger and I never made it that far. It was almost 4 in the afternoon and I sat at a pub table. My sleeve got stuck to the table. A voice came from behind the bar that said. If you want drinks or food, you have to order at the bar as there were no waitresses. I got up and grabbed a couple menu's. Looked it over and said. Let's go, I've seen enough. I will only pass thru college towns from now on!"
0,"It's fairly cheap as far as strip hotels are concerned, in my mind that's the only reason to stay there. I reserved a pyramid king room and they gave me a tower. Eh. The room was ok, no view at all though."
0,"Extremely overpriced for what you get. You end up paying nearly $50 if you get bottomless mimosas. That really isn't as great as it sounds. I'm sure their dinner is better. But their lunch selection is not all that special. Maybe it's because they serve a lot of breakfast foods, and I'm not a huge fan of those types of food. Their banana hazelnut toast was interesting and fresh, but a huge portion to say the least. Their omelets were fresh and made to serve so you can customize it in which ever way you'd like. I'd say my favorite entree there would be the bleu cheese pasta. But that was about it. Their soups were boring, salmon was dry, and chicken skewers looked cool but were really just cold and tough. I just felt like it was a dressed up hometown buffet.. nothing special. I probably could've done more with that $50 out on the floor of the casino because I didn't have much of an appetite for their food."
1,"Not a 5 star place just yet!!! But in time it'll be because I only went once and haven't tried everything! The food I ate was good to my taste! I order the Honey Walnut shrimp and it was perfect, not too much mayonnaise and crispy to the bite! So far the service I got was quick and friendly! Not too big of a restaurant! Perfect for the neighborhood! The place feels like a whole in the wall restaurant with good food. lol BUT its a modern and clean looking place!! The price is average for a meal around 10 bucks. A little high for quick Chinese take out, but worth it! I would say the restaurant without the host and waiters!! lol! I will be going back to try the other dishes and keep my review updated!"
0,It sucks!!! My room didnt have a trash can! The couch bed was full of springs and cover! But it was roomy and had alot of channels no elevator or handicapped equivalent.
0,"Oh Rain how I wish you'd go away, and not the rain falling from the sky.  \n\nIve been to Rain Nightclub a number of times (by number I mean more then I can remember), and while I have had some GREAT experiences, in recent times not so much.  Ive written a permanent mental note to myself that I have outgrown the allure of Rain.\n\nComing to Rain for the first time is an experience every Vegas newbie should endure.  What could be better?  You are in a very hip hotel and a trendy nightclub.  There are beautiful girls, handsome men, fire and go-go dancers.  Nothing is better at that moment.  Fast forward 10 years and you realize the music is horrible.  Ladies and Gents that is where I am at.\n\nI love all types of music and artists.  From Rap to Hip-Hop, Classical, Jazz, Electronic.... But Techno just isn't for me.  After 3 songs I feel like Ive been time warped into a futuristic torture chamber.  And I look around and I'm the only person in agreeance.... everyone else us having the time of their lives.  I went once and Deadmau5 was the DJ.  I prefer Kaskade, sorry.  It wasn't my type of music and i was forced to drink more... well until I ordered my patron on the rocks (yes i drink patron on the rocks).  High drink prices are to be expected, its Vegas.  But I need to be having a good time while I'm spending my gas money and I wasn't so I left.  \n\nThe next time I decided to give Rain the old college try was because DJ Jazzy Jeff was on the wheels of steel.  Yes, the same DJ Jazzy Jeff from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.  Only he was playing Deadmau5.  OMG what is going on?  That was the last and final time I will ever visit Rain....\n\n\nBUT for those of you who like Techno Id advise you to get the Palms Club Pass.  It expedites your entry into the clubs and gives you the option to leave and keep the party going in many venues.\n\n\nALSO I'm 5'10\"" without shoes so imagine me in heels.  And that fire comes really low.  Ladies beware...."
1,"I go into Clothes Minded at least every couple of weeks to see what's new... the styles are right on trend, the jewelry is amazing & one of a kind, the clothes are great for dressy and casual and the shop is adorable.  Plus Kim the owner is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet - and she gives great style advice!!"
0,"I usually love Oliveo. I've been eating from Oliveo Grill for years now. But I ordered my pizza over an hour ago and I am still waiting for it. It better not be cold...\n\nEdit: They said they were on their way 15 minutes ago.\n\nEdit: Got the pizza, it was cold. They won't give us our money back."
1,I came here on a Monday for comedy night and I loved it. The Turf isn't very authentic its more of a modern Irish pub. Everyone hanging out here was really friendly and the comedians were really funny.  We had a few drinks and shared the corned beef quesadilla. I had my doubts about the Irish/Mexican dish but it was actually pretty good. The servers were on point and never once corrected my cousin whenever he asked for a Carlsbad. I felt so at home here I can't wait to go back!
1,"Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I get really, really nervous when I'm traveling and wind up eating in tourist central. In most cities, you really wind up with only two options: You're either paying through the nose for decent food or paying a smaller amount for nastiness.\n\nI'm happy to say that Mussel Inn didn't veer too far in either direction; our mussels were nicely spiced, steamed and flavorful, with perfectly solid service and a kind front of house that found us a table on a very busy evening. And prices were far from unreasonable; not cheap but not nearly as horrifying as I expected. Made for a satisfying meal downtown."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE These people have no idea how to make coffee(extreme cream and sugar), the line is slow and it takes 7+ minutes to get your order."
1,"Went there while vacationing in Montreal, heard so much about the place, so reserved it before leaving 3 weeks in advance. They did call back. When we arrived the restaurant was full, it's a little noisy atmosphere, but it only adds to the charm in my opinion. We ordered a pickled bison tongue for the appetizer, amazing. Main course: duck in a can, terrific, still don't understand how they make this dish and keep it warm serving at the table. The special that day they had a whole rabbit, that i shared with my daughter, very good. For desert we enjoyed chocolate pot and a pear with ice cream. Like I said, it seemed that everybody around in the restaurant enjoyed their meal and the atmosphere.  They didn't rush anybody, like somebody wrote on this site, so go and enjoy. Will definitely go again."
0,"My body is seething with hate right now and I didn't even try their food. Flamingo Pizza has shady businness ethics. On Saturday, I decided to cancel my order after the lady said it would take between a hour and forty minutes. That was too late for me. A few days later my debit card has a pending charge even after I canceled. Ugh, I hate this. Don't fuck with my money. I know I might sound like an asshole right now because the transaction is still pending but I just don't like it when I'm being charged $50+ over something I didn't even buy. That could go towards a nice Christmas gift, ya know? Don't buy pizza in Chinatown."
1,"We have been using Hopper Pest Control since we moved to AZ from out of state in June of 2012.  Being new to the AZ climate, we had tons of questions concerning scorpions, roaches, snakes, etc.  They been so great about answer every question and so patient with us!  Both Mike and Tyre are professional, but very friendly and they want to make sure the job is done right.  Recently, they have also started doing landscape maintenance.  Just yesterday they came for our monthly pest control and we asked them to trim some out-of-control shrubs; they did an amazing job and were at our house for 5 hours getting it done.  We have truly appreciated that they are hardworking people that go above and beyond!  I cannot say enough great things about them and highly recommend using Hopper Pest Control."
1,J'ai vraiment ador\u00e9 l'ambiance vraiment inusit\u00e9 pour un restauranr Thai. Le repas \u00e9tait vraiment int\u00e9ressant et surtout d\u00e9licieux ! \u00e0 essayer !
0,"This place sucks. I wasn't let in because I had a temporary drivers license that I had got 2 days ago in Texas. I also had a had copy of my Texas security license, and my old i.d card from texas. All issued by the dmv, all with the same picture and DOB. Apparently the state of Arizona doesnt accept real licenses....it wouldnt be so bad, but the \""security\"" were assholes."
0,"We've had their over priced food before and it was good, but not worth the money. This time we went there twice for to-go items. We tried a sandwich and salad (chicken salad sandwich is bland, get some flavorful chips to put inside it) and both were reasonable in size and price. The next day we grabbed yogurt parfaits for breakfast. They were good size and fresh but still expensive for what they were. they also dont have spoons that reach the bottom, so you have to get yogurt on your hand to get it all"
1,"On a mission to try new restaurants closer to home, we found Dos Caminos which had recently opened in our neighborhood.  We chose to eat inside but next time will definitely relax on that gorgeous looking patio.  The guacamole is made fresh to order. We had the traditional kind and the mango habanero.  My only regret is not ordering the one with crab as well.  We shared queso fundido, the chicken taquitos and the grilled shrimp quesadilla. And the mexican street corn side has a great presentation and a really fabulous smoky taste. I loved all our choices. Everything tasted really fresh and vibrant. Our server was knowledgeable, cheerful and efficient and we really got to enjoy our experience. \nI'm really pleased that a restaurant of this quality has opened up on my side of the City, rather than having to trek to the Strip.  Looking forward to returning to try more of their menu and to sample another of their tempting Margaritas."
1,"imagine you have been on a long journey.  a LONG journey.  you have tromped down aisle after aisle, dodging children and carts, sidestepping around displays...you are tired.  exhausted...and hungry.  that trip through swedish furniture heaven has left you with a hunger you can't describe...but never fear...the ikea cafeteria is here!\n\nthe swedish meatball meal is fucking AWESOMENESS!  love, love, love it.  their potatoes rock, the lingonberry sauce is the shit and the gravy is seriously an orgasm in your mouth.  this meal is so good, i get it every time.  i munched on some of the salmon my hubby got...it was descent...but he made a mistake not getting the meatball goodness.  IF they have it, also try the lingonberry juice...the last two times i've gone, they didn't have it (sad, sad monkey), but when they do, i GULP that shit down!  it's badass.  i also dig the europe feel of the place...you clean up your own table, which i like.\n\n5 stars for awesomeness-ness...especially cuz you get a workout right before you chow down."
1,"When I am in the area, I like to stop by the Las Vegas Premium Outlets. Preferably on a weekday when it is less crowded. 2b bebe is my favorite store here! I have to agree with what Chanel said, this store is not the same as bebe. If you are looking for the same merchandise found in bebe stores at discounted prices, you won't find any of that here. What you will find is cheaper quality products that are specifically made for 2b bebe. \n\nI love bebe, but I can't afford to shop there all the time. So 2b bebe is a great alternative for me! I find a lot of great merchandise here, and I like the fact that $50 will buy me 2 tops here in comparison to just 1 top at regular bebe stores. I think the quality of 2b bebe clothes is still better than Forever 21. In my experience, some of the things I purchased at Forever 21 got destroyed after just 2-3 washes. \n\nCustomer service is sometimes nonexistent. The employees who work on the weekends always seem tired and irritated. But that's understandable since this place is really busy on the weekends! Another time when I stopped in on a weekday, there were two employees standing in the front who were talking about what they did over the weekend and did not bother to greet any customers at all. But that's okay, I don't really expect good customer service at any women's clothing store anyway, LOL!\n\nIf you are a clubbebe member, you can earn points and redeem your rewards here as well!"
1,"I love this place, a stand-by for happy hours.  The beer selection is amazing and the food is top-notch for bar grub.\n\nComing here with a group and knowing a little bit about beer is gonna get you points with any crowd.  Want a nutty brown ale, you got Moose Drool.  Not a beer fan?  Recommend the Lindeman's Framboise.  Want to class it up with a Belgian?  They got everything from Chimay to Gulden Draak.  Beer to impress.\n\nFor food, I would recommend the Bernaise Sliders.  Nice rib-sticking bar food that anybody can enjoy.  Will be back frequently!"
1,"This place was a fun and refreshing alternative to the conventional restaurant for date night. The menu offers creative combinations of toppings and then you pick the style of sausage you want and it's all served on warm naan. At first, I was given the wrong order, but the staff was friendly, quick to apologize and fixed their mistake. The food truck scene allows us to bring the dog and for $20, we had a delicious meal and a change of scenery. Awesome."
1,Thin Man Sandwich Shop is not your typical deli. I've had the Il Bastardo and The Thin Man - both signature sandwiches but the latter being the most popular in the joint. The sandwiches are pricey but large (sandwiches are about $10). I found myself ordering a side but the sandwiches alone fill me up way past dinner. The ingredients are fresh with the sandwiches made in front of you and the unique combinations tantalize the taste buds. Something unfamiliar and pushes my boundaries but is delicious. Worth giving a shot if you have an open mind!
0,"I remember driving down the alley a while ago and passing a garbage can with a rather sophomoric retort to the restaurant's quickly declining food quality. While callow, I admit to having giggled and nodding. Accurate, in a sense, that the phrase was \""Puke Bread\"". Basically, yeah. \n\nI am somewhat biased, as I did work there for a bit, but in this particular scenario, I feel I can identify what other reviewers have noted in regards to the service. \n\nJust so you know, yes, the servers are nonplussed about you being there. No, they don't actually like the food, and chances are, they have a different manager than they had the week before.\n\nSo, why two stars you ask? Have you SEEN the martinis? Whew. Worth my $10."
0,"My Earl Grey Soy Latte tasted just great... but the buck-fifty surcharge for the soy (NOT posted on the menu board, I'm supposed to \""inquire\"") -- that earns 1 star and I won't be going back.  I know it's Vegas... I know I'm going to be charged too much everywhere... but that's just ridiculous, and really bad form to not post it, or at least instruct employees to inform you!  Not to mention the regular size drink was already priced at $5.50.... Nope, sorry.  Starbuck's is very close and my soy latte there was topping out under $5 total."
1,"Pretty good.\nThe staff was super friendly.\nI liked their baked rolls\n\nA bit on the pricy side, but its a good treat for payday."
1,"I have been coming to this location for 15 years or so. I just heard it is closing in March to become a company owned marijuana dispensary. ???? How did that company meeting go? No profit in oil, let's change to pot! Too bad, this was a pretty well run oil change and service area."
0,"THIS IS A SCAM! I am a diamond member with Hilton Honors, travel and stay with Hilton over 100 nights a year. When booking a hotel for an out of town business trip, I was told Hilton has this amazing offer for Diamond members only, and was a great deal. So I thought, what the hell, its only $200 for a few nights. \n\nWhat they don't tell you is that there are numerous ADDITIONAL CHARGES for virtually anything you can imagine. For example, traveling over any holiday is an additional $200. If you travel over the weekend, expect at least a $50 additional charge. The issue I have is they don't tell you about these charges until after you purchase the package and try to book your room!! \n\nIf you do decide to buy into Hilton's scam, make sure you ask them about any additional charges BEFORE you purchase this garbage \""deal\"". Just be careful, they may charge you a \""concierge fee\"" for asking too many questions."
0,"I've never reviewed a flat out franchise before, but I feel compelled to because I've never been to a TGI Friday's before and, more importantly, I have too much time on my hands.\n\nNo, I didn't go to Vegas to eat at TGI Friday's. We really weren't feeling that long buffet line though. We were seated quickly and a server came out of nowhere and yelled \""Hey HEY hey.\"" Scared the hell out of me. I look at the menu and, unsurprisingly, most of that shit has meat in it. Even the salad! They chop up chicken and bacon in that shit. Mannn. I end up ordering this big ass potato with sauteed veggies in it. The heaviest vegetarian meal I've ever eaten. Pretty salty and really oily. Not really a complain, just something I noticed. \n\nServer was fine, food was adequate, I guess. I'll probably never come back. There's gotta be better restaurants in Las Vegas that aren't in smoke-filled casinos."
0,"Horrible place!!!  Went on a Tuesday night about 12:00am.  Stayed for about an hour.  My bros and I dropped $170 and didn't see one topless girl.  Place was empty. Nasty girls sat in our lap, argued about price and left pissed off that we wouldn't pay $400 for a lap dance.  One guy in my party gave each of them a $20 for their time.  They were still pissed.  No one danced on stage.  Place sucked big time...don't waste your time!"
0,"IT's small, they gave me wet sandals, lighting's meh. My facial was great ! My only complaint was the size of the facility and the overall look. I'd go back to Luxor's spa instead."
0,"WORST Vegas experience EVER! \n\nWhere do I start?? First of all, my husband was attending a conference, & we made our reservations for a King room 4 months in advance at the conference price. When we arrived, we were checked into a double TWIN room. When we made this mistake known to the front desk they told us; \"" we are very busy with another big conference & near sold out. We can see if tomorrow we can accommodate you better\"". It was late, & we were both very tired from the 8 hour drive, so we agreed. \n\nThe next day in between my husband's VERY important conference, he attempted multiple times to remedy the mistake. Each time he was told \""well, maybe we can change your room this afternoon, after housekeeping? But we are near sold out, so we just don't know\"". \n\nAt 1 pm the second day of our stay, we were given another room. We packed up all our stuff/luggage & made our way to the next, supposedly correct room.......MUCH to our dismay, this room was also......you guessed it.....a double TWIN.  So, we slupped our luggage BACK down to the front desk to AGAIN attempt to rectify the mistake. \n\nFINALLY, on day 2 of our 3 day stay.....we obtained our correct room. Albeit, the crapiest King room they probably had, with a view of the dirty/dusty, pipe filled roof of the \""good tower\"". The wall was PAPER thin, & the drunk guy next door kept smoking in his room despite the wing being \""smoke free\"". I could actually SEE the smoke wafting under the adjoining door (that incidentally, his drunk ass kept trying to open, day & night). \n\nEach time we encountered the front desk person of the hotel, we were met with smiles & apologies, but little else for these logistical mistakes. \n\nI mean, seriously??? Doesn't the computer system KNOW which rooms are TWINS & which are KINGS?  Seems simple to me??? \n\nAlso, in the land of complimentary hookers & cocaine......all we got was a meaningless \""sorry\"" from the front desk for this kind of minimum wage worker folly of errors??   At least toss us a spa credit or something???  For what we paid for this place....you'd think they could actually get the damn reservations right? \n\nWith all the competition & places to stay in Las Vegas....shame, SHAME on \""Caesar's Shack\"" for their lack of customer services & mediocre facilities. \n\nI WILL NOT be planning another stay at this craptastic place EVER again!! \n\nDo yourselves a favor & stay next door at Bellagio or even at one of the older places like Luxor.....I bet you'll get some ACTUAL customer service....."
0,"These guys are thieves!  \nI accompanied my wife to the store one day to have a headlight bulb installed.  I tried but was afraid I'd break something, so we let them do it.  The $25 installation charge wasn't the problem; the problem occurred when the service technician approached my wife and told her she needed a new set of tires and her AT fluid flushed, along with an oil change.\nOur oil is full synthetic and was just changed 2 months prior and only accumulated 3,000 miles since then.  The AT has absolutely no issues and shouldn't be flushed so soon; absolutely no reason.  The tires had tons of available tread on them, so we went around the corner to discount tires, where they told us we didn't need tires for at least another 20,000 miles!  Go figure.  Pep Boys Technicians have little honesty."
1,"This place earned a few more stars because I gave them another shot and  it was actually a good experience. The gentleman that helped me was awesome! It was a busy Wednesday morning and there were only 2 employees. They kept their cool and he kept track of the order that people came in. He didn't rush thru anyone's needs and had excelled  customer service skills. I wish I would have taken his name because , you sir.. You alone have made this snobby, crappy customer service MAC store a better place. Well done."
1,"We went to Dolce because we had a Groupon.  I enjoyed the \""bread and beans\"" - very Italian.  Our appetizer was the stuffed mushrooms - very filling and good enough to be a main entree.  I had the Amatriciana and my boyfriend had the Bolognese.  Both were great and with generous portions.  Unfortunately, we had no room left for dessert.  My two minor complaints were our wait for glasses of water and the distance between tables - conversations were very close.  \nI would definitely go again."
1,"My favorite stop after a long days work, I usually get a breakfast wrap & low calorie smoothie with no added sugar but I so 2 scoops of protein. I eat the wrap, throw the smoothie in the fridge, hit the gym and when I'm done drink the smoothie shower and bed. Perfect place for a busy guy like me. I'll always come back! Lol"
0,"Rocket Fizz used to be an exciting place to visit for me, but all that changed a few months ago when new management took over, complete with new suppliers and a vastly inferior drink selection to that previously on offer.\n\n\""Back in the day\"" I would load up on all sorts of goodies, a dozen different ginger beers, the delightful 'Chocolate Egg Cream' and all sorts of fascinating stuff. These days so much is missing and I'm not sure I can deal with any more fruitless visits and promises of \""the missing stock being back soon\"" - I'm just not buying this line anymore. It's clearly not part of the new supplier's line and from now on I have to make do without all my faves and lament at how their spots seem to have been taken by different Jarritos flavours and stuff available from the \""specialty soda\"" sections of Albertsons, Whole Foods etc anyway.\n\nRocket Fizz needs to recapture the magic the previous management had about the place if they want to recapture my business."
0,"Boy I gotta tell ya - what a HUGE disappointment this place was. I've been dieting for the last 5 months and have finally reached my goal - and then some, so I decided to treat myself (good behavior) and have some fast food. At first I thought Wendy's until I saw that famous In-N-Out sign and pulled right in. The service was impeccable, the food? Not so much. I ordered the single cheeseburger with fries and a root beer. The bun on my burger was greasier than the burger itself - I could barely hold on to it! The fries  -  although hot  -  we're as dry as cardboard and actually tasted like cardboard...even my root beer was weak - how the heck can you screw up a root beer?!?! Five months of hard work and my reward completely and totally sucked. Thanks...I really should have gone to Wendy's - well, next time!"
1,Third time there and everyone is extremely nice and friendly. I dig the sauces that this chain offers. The sandwiches at this location are great! A total repeat.
1,"I returned to this place on my second visit over a few weeks time. Z Pizza has 7 salad menu, 8 sandwiches, and many pizza choice selections or build it yourself in different sizes. Or you can order  the slice(s) and usually they will have 4 flavors available that rotates on a daily basis. When I came in with my party, we had the choice of Hawaiian, egg plant, pepperoni and cheese. I ended up ordering the chicken curry sandwich by which I ask them to convert to a salad.  The chicken curry salad was flavorful, healthful, colorful and one that I enjoy. Superlative ....\n\nThe pizza are huge slices. When I had it last time and order one, I got addicted and ordered a second one. The pizza by the slice, are near thin and has a near clean bite to it instead of the oily and heavy stuffing feel that you get from pizza chains or warehouse places. It made me feel not guilty for my health...The cooks here do a good job in making their pizzas. Pizza slices go for about $3 and most of the menu items are about $7 .  The wait to get your ordered items is about 4-5 minutes...\n\nThe inside decor is very artful for a pizza place, you have to check it out yourself if you appreciate art. The art looks like it belongs in a hip coffee shop and that is a plus for a pizza place. The place is clean and seats comfortable. There are regular tables and a comfy sofa. There are seating outside as well. Zpizza also share access to the coffee and ice cream shop next door as it is under the same management. You can choose to sit in either shop..\n\nThe near midtown location makes it a ideal spot for business lunch or convenient spot. Parking is sufficient... I highly recommend this place if you need to grab a cheap and simple yet tasteful bite by yourself or plan to eat with friends and lounge afterwards at the next door coffee shop. The folks who work here are also friendly. And you can order take out too..."
1,"So I finally made the trip to Smashburger and WOW this place rocks.  I got a custom built burger with Chipotle bun, apple wood bacon, chipotle mayo, jalapenos, habenero cheese, and a 1/2 burger.  I also got the smash fries after reading all the reviews about how amazing they were.  Which yes they were.  : )  I was in heaven eating this burger it was dripping out everywhere just like a good burger should.  \n\nThis is one of my new favorite burger shops in the valley so if you haven't been make the trip it's worth it."
1,"The Olive Garden is the only thing I truly believe that every state should have dozens of. We could use less Jamba Juice stores, we could use less 7-11's but we can not survive without multiple Olive Gardens.\n\nAnd that might seem like an odd statement seeing as how I live in Hawaii where have no Olive Gardens at all. So if I just stated that we can't survive without one, why am I still alive?\n\nWell, I live off of hope. Hope that one day I'll get to eat at Olive Garden again. Hope that I'll indulge myself in the breadsticks, salad and soup.\n\nThankfully in my most recent trip to Las Vegas, I was able to take my gf to Olive Garden. We were seated after a short wait and it was game time baby! Before we knew it we had breadsticks and salad on the table. I ordered up some of the chicken and gnocchi soup. The breadsticks were perfect as they always are. And the soup? The soup was awesome. Nice pieces of roasted chicken with small dumplings full of flavor. I added some pepper and it went very nicely with the spinach. It was all very satisfying.\n\nFor my entree I had the parmesan crusted steak. It came with mashed potatoes and it tasted like a small piece of heaven. She had shrimp over linguini and that too was also full of flavor.\n\nThere were a few hiccups on the service side. I was supposed to get unlimited refills on my strawberry tea but instead she filled it with regular tea. Our server also said that she'd bring us more bread but she didn't. By that time we were full anyways so it didn't really matter.\n\nPlease oh please god of Olive Garden.. please see fit to bless us with one of these in Hawaii?"
0,"This store is run by a bunch of teenagers with zero customer service. Everything is non-refundable and they don't offer holds. When I spoke to the manager, Esmeralda, about this she rudely told me, \""everything is fair game.\"" They really need to work on their customer service considering 99% of their dresses are overpriced tacky nonsense. Will NOT be returning to this store. Corporate really needs to come in and reevaluate their management at this store because I have never been to a Windsor with such awful customer service."
0,"Yeah, I dont think we will be coming back any time soon here either. I dont know what has happened to this place over the last year, but something really bad has happened to it. \n\nThe water pitcher had someone's hair in it. The waiter made us feel like he was doing us a favor by serving us. The eggs benedict was cold, and so were the potatoes, so we waited 10 minutes for the waiter to come around to sent them back. They came back again cold. By this time the rest of the family had finished their meal so I said screw it, ate the potatoes cold, paid, and left. Gave them a sub-par tweet and they replied that they wanted to make things right with us. Still havent heard back from them. Im done."
0,"We called ahead on Christmas Day to inquire about their hours.  We were told they would be open till seven p.m.  We arrived at 6:35, as they were locking their front doors, with about ten cars waiting in the drive through.  Their food is not as good as other Pandas, it is always MUCH spicier than any other Panda in AZ.  So now I have two reasons to stay away from this location in Buckeye.   Rice Garden inside Bashas on dysart is superior in all aspects."
1,"This place is great! It is so quaint and homey, and that's one of the many reasons I love it.  They offer your traditional sushi rolls,  plus a few new and unique options.  Everything is fresh and delicious,  and I love that they use a light tempura batter.  Staff is SO nice,  and you can tell they genuinely care about their customers.  Can't wait to come back for their monthly sake tasting event."
0,"The best part of this restaurant was the awesome decor! There was a massive replica of the United States which was fun to look at! Other than that the food was sub-par. Our table ordered chicken noodle soup (which was good), a burger (that was overcooked, chicken tenders (that were more like chewy chicken nuggets), and biscuits and gravy that were okay but were luke warm. The service was bad. The location and lack of a wait time where a plus but we obviously know why there wasnt a wait time."
1,"Stuck in a little strip mall, which seems typical for the area. Nice ambiance given that. The staff was delightful and helpful, and the panang curry was excellent, as was the Thai iced tea and the Thai tea ice cream. I would definitely return and recommend."
0,"Came here with a friend for the second time. I hate to say this but our sever (his name was Allen or Alex) was extremely rude and unprofessional. He pretty much ignored us pinpoint and took like 50 min to bring WATER, while he served other customers just fine. I was very disappointed since food was as good as before."
0,"As a frequent eater of pho and spicy foods in general, I would advise to avoid.  I had a good deal of intestinal difficulty after eating here - probably due to the (my fault, I ate it) congealed chili oil.  The ph was gluton-ey and stuck to the bottom of my bowl. Bad experience overall due to that.  The food generally tasted good while I was there, though the fish sauce was too sweet. The waitstaff was very attentive and asked me several times if I needed more water or sauce.\n\nI got the Pho ga. By the end of the meal, we, collectively (two of us) had a mound of gristle 2\"" by 4\"".  That said, the broth was *great* and probably as good as that from Pho Ha in Greensboro.  The noodles are not so good.  They stuck together at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nAll in all, if you want a good bowl of Pho, stick to Vietnam Palace on South Boulevard."
0,They went corporate.  They don't care about their customerds.  It seems all their food comes premade from other suppliers.  It probably is the case for most of their items that their cooks are simply assemblers and not cooks from scratch.  We had bad service.
0,"This place was beyond horrible - and I wish Yelp had negative stars...\n\nfrom feces in the toilet upon my arrival, to coutertops that werent clean, to just plain shoddy accomodations AFTER my room change - i just wouldnt reccommend anyone stay here (unless I really, really, REALLY hated them)."
0,this place was awful.  the lettuce tased like it had been gathered onthe Monorail.  the wine was over priced and under aged.  the dressing tasted like it came with a kids meal at MacDonald s.  What a let down.  Will never repeat.  I have bought steakat the local meat market cooked on our grill and it was better. FORGET IT. YMMV.  We won't be back especially with the other choices within a mile.
1,"Big fan of Yogurtland...they are definitely better than Golden Spoon!  They always have great flavors that they keep in rotation which is nice because I like to always change it up...like my women!!! haha j/k :)\n\nI luv the holiday flavors...especially the pumpkin pie yogurt!  Give this place a try and I promise, you will be hooked!\n\nCheers!"
0,"maybe because i went there for the danity kane album release party, but gosh darn it, it was grossly unorganized!  there was no line to get in--it was just a mass of people crowded around the door.  i felt like i was in a mosh pit for an afi concert.  my friends and i called ahead to get on the vip list a few days earlier, and then we confirmed our names that morning...i guess tiffany (or whoever) \""forgot\"" to write our names down and then lied about it.\n\nthere were a lot of promoters who pretended to work for the club--they made a lot of empty promises to get us and a group of other ladies in.  anyway, after 30 minutes of getting elbowed and stepped on, my friends and i got in.\n\nsurprisingly small venue. way over crowded.  random soap foam falling from the celling.  shotty music transitions by the dj.  shot drinks not served in shot glasses--served in regular cups. wth. i guess that's upscale.  thank goodness we didn't have to pay."
0,"Over priced, bad food and worse service, in fact the food was indistinguishable from bad Chinese food."
1,"So we're moving out of our house and trying to get everything cleaned up to make it presentable. After having some other services come in I have to say I'm sick of people coming in and trying press me to up charge my Groupons.  I want the service I paid for.  With Luiz, this was not the case.  While he did mention there was a possibility for a deeper clean, he wasn't pushy about it at all.  I opted for the Groupon cleaning and was very happy!\n\nAfter getting all set up, Luiz and his partner made sure to explaine their products and how they were chemical free.  Very important with my daughter and dog running around.  The total job took about 30 minutes and, if you look at my before and after pics, it was awesome!  We haven't had our grout cleaned since we've lived in our house.  That's 5 years of disgusting that he cleaned up in no time.\n\nI am big on customer service and I have to say, this guy had to be one of the nicest people I have ever met.  He talked to me the whole time while doing his job and actually seemed like he cared about informing about the History of Grout.  If we weren't moving out of state I would definitely use this company again for carpets, grout, and anything else they provide.  I highly recommend snagging this Groupon and telling Luiz that Patrick sent you!"
1,I have been here more than a few times. Only bad I can say is that the broccoli she's needs to be more consisting on flavor. Everything else taste great. The jerk chicken is different than I'm use too. Compared to other places but it taste great. Like I said I come here often and will continue. BTW I am a chef.
1,"YUM, great crust and sauce.  Little pricey but never disappoints... gelato good too.  Garlic fries are ridiculous."
0,"I went today to use a groupon and they were out of almost everything.  No sandwiches, no vegan cheese, no whole wheat pasta.  The place was dirty and empty and I was there at noon.  I finally ordered enough to spend my $30 groupon,  and after a couple minutes, the employee came to tell me that she didn't have the ingredients to make what I ordered.  I'm really surprised this place is still in business.  Thankfully, Groupon refunded me the $14 we payed for the groupon.  We ended up having a nice lunch at Cafe Rio."
1,"This was my home for 4 days and 3 nights, I shared it with a friend and there was plenty of room for drunken stumbling, recovery and attempting to remember what we did, who we talked to and why'd we drink like that again... \n\nThe room was a good size, with a kitchenette, microwave, sink and all the normal pots, pans, plates and flatware you'd expect in a kitchen. There was even a blender, fridge and a toaster for use. I guess these are actually high rise condos and some people live in these places. Sickness. \n\nThe shower was big, the spa tub was nice, sinks nice and the toilet was as expected. My only problem with the bathroom was that there is NO fan in the toilet area...the guy I was sharing the room with is a health nut and was taking protein powder...lemme just say....BLEH! \n\nWe stayed on the 34th floor and had a nice view of the strip during the day and night. The windows are tinted so if you're too drunk to close em the night before you aren't getting beamed in the eyes by the dreaded Vegas sun. There's complimentary Internet access so I was able to post my shenanigans on FB and let others know what type of drunken debauchery was going down. \n\nThe problem I had with the hotel was that it was a bit of a journey to get to the main hotel as well as the food areas. But other than that, the staff was helpful, the maids were nice and they don't bother you if you and a friend walk in stumbling and your friend barfs in the empty vase on display in the Lobby. \n\nFun times! I'll be back, dunno if I'll get accepted back but I'll try! : )"
0,"This place was horrid, what was to be 2-3 hrs was 5-6hrs & when you're on vacation, time is of the essence. We had a sales guy who understood that we had to get going after breakfast, could we please look at place and go? He said \""too bad, there are procedures to follow and you have to expect this\"". We explained that we had family event, still nothing. He had us sitting to meet his manager, said he would try to hurry it along. My daughter went near them & listened, they were discussing sports! He knew we were in a hurry and purposefully delayed us. \n\nWhen I refused to shake the manager's hand - he called ME rude & the salesguy said \""Well you aren't buying anyway, so whatever\"" - um, I had enough money to buy a suite OUTRIGHT, but they were suck dicks that I would NEVER recommend dealing with them, nevermind buying anything from them. \n\nBAD BAD BAD!"
0,"Although the environment outside under a beautiful tree was ideal.... The food selection and portions were very small. Presentation, taste and service was very disappointing.  I would not suggest it!!!!"
0,"I really want to like this place but unfortunately I can't. It's just not a good place. The location is good. The building is interesting. The atmosphere is good.  The people are nice.\n\nBut... The product just doesn't cut it. And when all is said and done, the product delivered is the most important thing.  The coffee is poor and does not stand up to even gas station coffee. The packaging is not what you expect from a coffee house. If not served in ceramic mugs (hot drinks) or big glasses (iced drinks) at least use good quality paper and plastic cups, not styrofoam. \n\nUnfortunately I think this place will struggle... just like everything else in downtown Henderson does. It's too bad. This could be a great coffee shop in a great area. Both seem to be destined for extinction."
1,"Yeah, I made it for Taco Tuesday!!! Wow, $1 beef taco's, my girlfriend and I put down 7 tacos with an appetizer. This place was great, very busy and a little loud, but we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation. The only bad part is our waitress was a little slow in getting us refill's and we asked for more salsa and didn't get it, but will definately be back for $1 beef taco's."
0,"It should be half a star.   My order came completely wrong and tasted like day old leftovers reheated in a microwave.   Waitress never asked about the meal, manager only cared about the bill.\nSo as a disabled marine, i quietly paid & left.   Hence this mention on yelp, twitter, & to their corporate.  Everyone, do not eat at dennys, the food was horrible and the customer service was like the dmv.   Cold and uncaring."
0,"03/08/2014 @ 09:08am\n\nI just went through the drive-thru. I ordered a breakfast combo. Very slow service, after I paid , still very slim. I saw the cashier handle my food, I could see her fingers touch inside the little pouch for the potatoes. I did not see her fingers actually touch the food, but the surfaces that would my food would likely touch once the bag shifts. Next she went into the corner, coughed into her hand. This was no just a slight cough, it was a muilti-cough type of cough. She then wiped her hand on her chest, went back to my food and bagged it up. Again picking up my potato bag while touching inside the potato bag.\n\nWhat happened to washing your hands?\n\nI confronted her about it, and she started to be a bit rude, but I think she realized her mistake and changed her attitude quickly.\n\nI can not afford to lose work and get sick because employees don't want to wash their hands.  \n\nI got my refund and left hungry."
0,"4stars for cleanliness and atmosphere. 2 stars for the food i had on my first and probably last visit, menudo. 2 stars for the mild salsa."
1,"SO Good!  Homemade AND absolutely yummy.  Affordable, generous portions. Deserts are also out of this world. Can't go wrong between this and other restaurants in this shopping center.  Best to go on weekdays to avoid crowds.  I'll be frequenting this place often!  I'm from Boston and thought this tops many of the restaurants, there. That's quite a compliment."
1,"Disclosure: Men may not want to read. \nJust received my shipment today of all natural hormone therapy vitamins. I first found these vitamins through a friends recommendation at \""Whole Foods\"". I thought heck for all natural and $20 dollars it's worth a shot. Well needless to say I have been on them for three months now and love them. \n\nFor years doctor's have said I need a prescription hormone replacement to balance myself out. NO way, I do not like drugs other than wine.....hee hee \nSo I decided to see if I could purchase them cheaper without having to run over to Whole Foods all the time. I found this website and yes they are much cheaper and more convenient. \n\nIt is a great website they carry vitamins, herbs, beauty products, sports, organic, nutritional items, sexual health, homeopathy, etc....such a great selection. They also have one price shipping for $4.99, which is awesome because this allows me to order a few month's supply making it much less expensive then purchasing from the store. Vitacost.com truly offers wholesale prices on thousands of vitamins, supplements and over-the-counter products. Most of the products they carry are sold at the Published Wholesale Price which is typically 33% to 75% less than what you would pay at the retail level. They also offer auto ship, which is very nice.\n\nThey have a clearance section and run promotions all the time once you order with them. The vitamins I am taking have really balanced me out naturally, no more major hot flashes, oh and they help you sleep like a baby. The shipping is fast and the Customer Service department is excellent. \n\nWould highly recommend this website."

1,"Went to New Tokyo Food Market today for some Japanese staples...Miso soup, nori (dried seaweed), Osenbei (flavored rice crackers), Furikake (dried seasoning mix) and Panko bread crumbs for Tempura recipes and they carry many other hard to find Japanese products. Prices are very reasonable and most products are authentic and not Americanized versions. Owner came over and helped us with our selections without being asked! Very helpful and nice!  Highly recommend this market located on S/E corner of 35th Ave. and Northern. Parking area is limited however! Banzai!!!!"
1,"My Hyundai Santa Fe encountered a throttle body issue. During the course of service, my radiator decided to crack spewing fluid all over the place. Phil was helpful getting another shop honor their \""lifetime warranty\"" on the radiator. Once that was taken care of at a very reasonable price, my main issue was resolved. Will be a loyal Litchfield Auto customer for life."
1,This is the third time being here and I have to say I really like it. Armen is great! He does my son's hair and he always does a great job in asking my opinion on the hair since I'm very picky with the length. Today is the first time my husband did is his hair here with Nathan he was good too!! I really liked that they were open on thanksgiving day it saved me so they are very convenient I would highly recommend them! Ask for Armen and Nathan!!!
0,Excellent food but they are unorganized when it comes to providing their food in an efficient manner. Was quoted to pick up a pizza in 20 mins and it wasn't ready until 50 mins (30 mins after the time quoted). I dont mind waiting 50 mins for excellent food but I'd rather be prepared for it when they tell me to arrive 20 mins after I placed an order.
0,"Bad!!! \n\nI was a loyal Chicken Bonz customer at the original location on Sunset, then they became Chicken Shack. I was excited to see this Chicken Bonz because it is much closer to my House than the original, but I was sadly disappointed, The chicken is plain and the ranch is terrible! I now drive to Chicken Shack in Henderson to get my fix. Way better food!"
1,"This Walgreens is in the perfect location for all the tourists passing through the strip.  You can get anything here, even fresh fruit for your cocktails and souveniers that don't cost you an arm and a leg!

1,The drunken noodles..... Get them now. \n\nThe restaurant owner is very nice and you can tell he loves what he does. Now don't let the layout throw you. It may not be the fanciest but the noodles are goooood. We ll be back. \n\nPrice 3.5/5 average \nAtmosphere 3/5 \nFood 5/5
0,"This place is an OK place to grab lunch.  The food is OK and moderately priced.  Of course because it is in Las Vegas there are many better options if you take a minute to look.\n\nLate at night though you should avoid this place.  We had walked by many times.  They are always playing good music and the energy seems good.  We finally went in and found that inside was a different story.  The crowd is a little lacking and the environment reminds you of spring break.  That is probably a good thing for some,  but not me.\n\nIt is tempting to stop in because you do not have the lines or high cover charges of Las Vegas clubs, but you will find that maybe the charge and wait are worth it."
0,"This hotel is very overrated and overpriced.  I've stayed there two times now and both experiences had their issues. \n\nThe first stay was a few months after it opened.  We stayed in a suite for 4 nights.  The suites are overall fairly nice with its technology and tons of amenities including two bathrooms, washer/dryer, fridge/freezer.  The one greatest thing about the hotel are the balconies.  Its great to sit out there in a robe after a long night out or after a shower.  Our hotel room was left fairly dirty with large visible crumbs all over the couch and the bathrooms didn't have any shampoo or conditioner.  I had several very bad interactions with the staff on this stay.  One particular interaction with the pool waitress stands out.  I was attempting to get service while sitting at the bamboo pool.  The waitress blew past me a total of 6 times before we gave up and retrieved our own drink.  Two of those times include waving our hands in the air and the final time I was waving a wallet in my hand.  We never even received a look from her.  When questioning the bartender on how to get service he commented on how rude we were waving cash.  The majority of the clientele fit a stereotype of your Jersey Douchebag.  \n\nBecause I enjoyed the balcony so much and we went to a Weezer concert at the Boulevard Pool I booked a couple nights in a suite again.  DISGUSTING, is the key word to categorize the room.  There were signs all over the room of a previous cocaine binge in the room.  The books still had cocaine residue on them.  There were 3 locations in the room where we spotted blood.  One of them was right in the middle of the shower.  Two of the decorative pillows had visible semen stains.  We left the pillows at the door after the first night hoping they would take them away only to find them in the room again.  Interactions with the staff was better this time.  The clientele seemed to be evening out a bit more.  What unfortunately ruined the last night for us was an awful experience at the STK restaurant.  I'll save that for a separate review.  There are much better hotels on the strip for less money."
0,"Last weekend my boyfriend and I stayed at the Monte Carlo with my brother and sister-in-law. Before booking a hotel in vegas, we did a lot of searching and wanted to find a hotel that was reasonably priced with a good pool. We ended up choosing Monte Carlo.. and after this weekend I wish we would have decided on another hotel. \n\nWe arrived late Thursday night (close to midnight) and the line to check in was about an hour wait. They only had two people working!! Finally someone was smart enough to request backup and once a few other employees came to help the line moved much quicker. Once we arrived at the front desk, we were greeted by an extremely rude male employee. He acted if we had just ruined his evening by walking into his place of business! As we were checking in, he informed us that only one room would have a king (which we both requested) and the other would have a queen. Then he said they would be smoking (we requested non-smoking). We asked if there was anything he could do to make changes because we would be extremely unhappy with those accommodations. He said there was nothing he could do and then gave us a figure as to how much it would cost if we wanted to cancel our reservation. At this point I asked to speak to the manager.\n\nOnce the manager arrived he was extremely polite and apologetic for his employee (must happen often!). He gave both rooms a $50.00 credit to a variety of restaurants in the hotel. He found two non-smoking room, one with a king and one with two queens, which at this point was fine with us because we wanted to be done with this process already! \n\nThe hotel was extremely out-dated and we had a worker come up UNANNOUNCED to fix something in the bathroom. My boyfriend stayed at Harrah's for a fraction of the price the last time he was in Vegas and he said the rooms looked exactly the same! \n\nWe figured the pool would be the saving grace for the hotel... but sadly we were mistaken. Unless you are traveling with children - this pool is not for you! There were kids everywhere!! Not that I can't stand children (I've been a nanny for 6 years) but when I want to take a dip in the pool, cruise down the lazy river, dance in the wave pool with the DJ playing music, or lay out.. I'd prefer not to hear screaming kids or be splashed like crazy! \n\nAnd to top off this awful experience, my credit card has been charged an extra $150 on top of what the total charges for our stay were. I called the front desk (which took over 20 minutes waiting on hold to finally get a live person) and they said that its just an insurance charge that will be removed once the total room charge has gone through on the account - WRONG! At this moment my card has approved, and been charged both the total charge for the weekend AND the $150 \""insurance\"". I am calling back today to get this sorted. \n\nThe only thing this place has going for it is the location on the strip \n\nOVERALL : Monte Carlo = Monte Crapo!!"
0,"The wash is good, a little pricey but what really bothers me is the up selling! I've been going there since 95 and it has had several owners but now I'm going to wash my sweet 01 Tacoma somewhere else. \nThe guy sees my sun faded, bleached trim and scratches and I have to tell him ITS A FKN WORK TRUCK! It's my baby but detailing it is a lost cause.\nNow I get the windshield repair tech promising that they can repair all the chips in the glass and all we need is your insurance card. I told her today that my insurance is not glass friendly and besides none of the \""chips\"" that I could barely find were in my line of sight. I get the up sale twice by two people and while waiting for my truck. \n\nYou lost another customer as a result."
0,"Long wait for food, waitresses that don't know what they're doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again."
0,I went to this place twice-- I could taste MSG in their food. I will never go back.\nSorry but that is the truth.
1,"Great place to eat with plenty of eye candy for guys...complete with shorts shorts and cute faces. \nNow the food was good...i actually am on a diet...and it actually had some good choices: wedding soup and Margarita pizza. The soup was filled with pebble pasta, some meat and a big meat ball...complete with a cheese breadstick. The pizza is a thin crust and not bad at all....you have to eat the whole pizza to be full. Great ambience and has an outside patio. Thumbs up for Italian food"
1,"After the experience we had at Merkato, I needed to try ethiopian food again and, I hoped, enjoy it.\n\nMission accomplished.\n\nBlue Nile is small but inviting, almost hidden away in a tiny commercial center. Simple without being simplistic, it was bright, clean, quiet, a little colorful, and just slightly eclectic in its decor.\n\nCasual and friendly, the staff seemed to be preparing for the evening when I walked in to wait for my friend. Immediately greeted in at least three different languages (which I found really cool) and facing a barrage of genuine smiles, I was at ease right away. I was allowed to choose my table; I picked a seat in eyesight of the door and settled in.\n\nThe wine I had while waiting was a \""house\"" chardonnay and only cool, not cold. As I wasn't here for the wine, I didn't let that phase me. Bonus points for the bottled orange soda that made my friend grin from ear to ear and reminisce about childhood. Wine? What wine? It was already forgotten.\n\nAgain we chose a sampler platter and some extras so we could really get a feel and a taste for the place. In a word: fantastic.\n\nThe flavors were, all at once, deep and bright, sweet, spicy, and savory. I can't eat the bread but my friend loved it. The proteins were tender and juicy and the produce was fresh. The staff was happy to help us build our platter and choose items based on flavors we liked and our desire to be introduced to new things. Delicious is an understatement.\n\nWe stuffed ourselves silly because we just didn't want to stop eating. The waitress offered more and we actually debated it, even though we still had so much in front of us. I think a to-go box was mentioned more than once.\n\nIt was evident that great care went into the experience, from the food to our care, and the whole thing renewed my excitement about a new (to me) cuisine."
0,"Staff at this location is a bit rude and condescending. Gym is ok, no real free wights , no bench, this is not for serious body builders. As a plus there are a lot of quality cardio machines"
1,"I really enjoyed this place.  So far as I can tell, it and Ping Pang Pong are the lone restaurants inside casinos that serve dim sum daily.  We had gotten in on a Sunday and missed dim sum at Bellagio, where we usually go, so on Monday we went to KJ's at Rio.  We arrived at about 11:15 am and the place was already packed.  The dim sum here is very fresh and they offer a wide variety.  My only complaint is that the service is kind of bad, but it's what you expect in a typical chinese restaurant.  Prices were very reasonable and you can get twice the amount of food here for the same money that you would pay at a strip dim sum restaurant."
0,"I don't normally do this, but I finally stopped being sick after eating here last night. \n\nI'd like to preface this by saying this is not a service review. The service was not the problem, although if she would have told me the Blue Moon was almost 7 dollars, I would have bought a six-pack of it on my way home instead. $5 would have been reasonable.\n\nThe real problem what what I ate. We ordered the soft pretzels and cheese as an appetizer - they were fine. As a Canadian, when I saw they added a special - Poutine - I had a nostalgia moment and ordered it. It was a long way from the delicious, savory poutine from my homeland. For those of you who have never eaten poutine, it would fit right in with southern style cooking. Take french fries, add creamy cheese curds (or if you're not sure where to buy those, chopped up braided mozzarella works well too), top with fresh, steamy brown gravy. The gravy and heat from the fries melts the cheese into a melty mountain of yum.\n\nThis was not what I experienced. First of all, the cheese curds were breaded and deep fried (another special appetizer they had). Instead of the poutine effect of creamy, melty, cheesy goodness, it was more like soggy clumps. I made due, it's been a while since I've had poutine. I asked for no pico de gailo, because I had no idea why it was included in their poutine. I didn't get any as part of the order, so once again, i praise the server for taking a proper order. There was enough gravy, but there was just something...off about it. It was very subtle, but there was a peculiar sourness to it that was enough for me to catch on my palette, but not enough for me to expect anything was wrong other than an odd recipe for one of my all-time favorite meals. \n\nThe abdominal pain started at 2 am, about 4 hours after consuming the meal. I'm a tall guy so things take their time digesting...usually. I was not prepared for the razor like purge that followed. Without sharing too many details of the horror stories that went on in that room, I will say that finally, at 12 pm today, I stopped feeling sick.\n\nNow I don't know if it was the cheese curds or the gravy (leaning towards the gravy), but I feel like there were some definite corners cut in the kitchen. If you're going to be serving food to people, what's coming out of the kitchen is a reflection on both the chef staff and the management. You need to have standards. Taste your food. Keep it consistent. \n\nThis is the only location that I've ever had such an experience. I hope this criticism serves as constructive, to prevent others from getting sick from the food. Please be conscious of the freshness of ingredients!"
0,"The food was amazing but the price a bit steep and atmosphere truly odd. It was hard to wrap my mind around a delicious $20 entree that was served on a picnic table next to a jaw-breaker machine, pop-dispenser, and a host of other chachke items that made the place feel messy. If the food could be served somewhere nice, I'd go back.  Otherwise, not so much."
1,I've only been here once and both my husband and I were surprised at how good the food happened to be. We didn't actually eat there..We sat at the bar and waited for our food and then took the food home. We were both surprised at how large the menu was and we had a hard time picking out what we wanted to try. We we got home and dug in the food was great and we were NOT disappointed.
1,"Simple, laid back & very casual.\n\nCopper is the best beer!! Food is good and service is quick. Plus they have FREE Yoga on Tuesday nights started by LuLuLemon. What could be better than yoga and beer??\n\nBest tip about this place: they have \""OMB coins\"" that you use like money - as if you're a leprechaun or 10yrs old in an arcade - so fun!!"
1,Ruben was very good but basically it's fast food in a casino so it's kind of overpriced plus you have to deal with the fact that you are in the casino
0,"what is it with my luck paying money for services that fail to fix my problem? I went in to Big O Tires after seeing an advertisement on their window for an A/C check. After driving around 2 wks in a hot as hell car I said enough is enough and gave them a call to diagnose the problem. I was told that I was almost a pound low on freon and sent on my way. Yay! Cheapest option, right? Wrong. So very very wrong. Unfortunately I dropped by an hour before closing so I'm guessing I was rushed out while they were closing shop. They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150. As I pulled into my driveway 15 minutes later my car was no cooler at all.\n\nNext day I book it there to see what they could do since I just dropped some cash there. \""Come in Saturday and my A/C guy will take a look.\"" Fine.\n\nCome Saturday I'm praying for a leak somewhere. Hey! I paid $15 for flourescent dye! It better prove useful. 30 minutes later and I'm told it is low. \""So it leaked since Monday?\"" I asked. \""Monday?\"" \""Yes. I brought it in Monday and paid for an evac and recharge.\"" He had no idea. Smell something fishy yet? So he takes it back again and looks it over finally coming back to say he was wrong about it being low (REEEEEAAALLY FISHY) and it is either one of two parts. I was referred to a shop for them to check as they couldn't do it there but they couldn't refund me for the evac and recharge. However I could have this shop do the repairs and Big O wouldn't charge for the second evac and recharge that would have to be done on my car. First off... nobody would let someone leave their shop after doing work only to have someone else finish the job. WTF.\n\nSo here I am now spending a grand for a new A/C today when $29.95 was supposed to diagnose this a week ago.\n\nIf you are feeling charitable, at least pick a more honest organization to throw your hard earned money at. Now if you excuse me, I have a district manager to write."
0,"I wish I could leave a review for the food but I never got that far. \n\nCame in, was immediately seated and handed the menu. 20 minutes later still no waiter, no acknowledgment from any of the servers or anyone that works there. So we decided to leave, I'm all for being patient but  20 minutes with no acknowledgement REALLY?! Sorry, we were told happy new year on the way out. Did I mention the place was only at 60% capacity. \n\nThanks Osaka you really know how to treat your customers."
1,"The hot crab legs are to die for! So delicious!!! \n\nCame here on a Wednesday night around 8pm. No line (thank goodness)! Last time we came, the line was wrapped around, and the wait was about 2 hours! The cost was about $50/ person. I thought that was pretty reasonable considering the amount of variety there was. In Hawaii, you'll easily pay $50 for a buffet that doesn't have half the choices of food. Our waiter was very friendly and always made sure our drinks were filled. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our meal here."
1,"Took my ccw class with Roger , very informative and definitely gets you in the right mindset to protect yourself the smart way. Afterwards I browsed the store, Merchant firearms staff were very friendly and helpful. A very nice selection of firearms and accessories."
1,"So thank god for good beer, 20 minutes and no food. Absolutely dead in here, and did i mention no chicken products in stock. Lucky i wanted some beer .... Did discount for wait, so not to bad."
0,"Worst limo experience I have ever had. Prior to writing this review, I tried to contact the owner who never responded. I booked 4 services from 5 star limo for our wedding day \n#1: pick up bride and bridesmaids: the driver was awful and incredibly rude. Didn't assist anyone with their bags or luggage. Never offered us water or beverages. Added 20% tip to my credit card without asking. \n#2: pick up groom and groomsmen: pretty much same story as before. Same rude driver. Limo was dirty. Empty beer bottles rolling around which weren't from us. Again, added 20% tip which was not deserved. \n#3: party bus to pick up guests and bring to wedding: bus broke down and was over 40 minutes late to pick up guests. Many guests ended up paying for taxi to wedding. Never called to inform us they were late. Had to delay start of ceremony because bus was so late. Again, added a 20% tip after arriving late and delivering guests late! \n#4 bring guests back to strip: pretty much same story as the others. Rude driver, added own tip.\nDo yourself a favor. Pay a bit more money, and find someone else for your limo needs."
0,"Please do not waste your time at this dealer.  It is sad to see that the sales team (Martin and Don) can be so gracious and accommodating, while the management can be so entirely out of touch with reality.\n\nAfter spending an hour in there showroom looking for a suitable automobile and waiting for them to come back with a counter offer, I was embarrassed to even be in the same room with this \""lady\"".\n\nI offered $4000.00 cash for a '03 ford explorer with 125,000 miles on it.  I then told them if they wanted my truck ('05 Expedition Eddie Bauer, with 157,000, and in excellent shape),  I would gladly let them have it for $6000.00.  ($5900.00 is low KBB)\n \nThis \""lady\"" came back with, get this:  I give her my newer, bigger, nicer truck and an additional  $5400.00, and she will sell me the older, smaller, less options other truck.  I could only laugh at this.\n\nThis is insanity!  I just wanted to get into a smaller, more fuel efficient truck and when I left I felt as though I had been molested.\n\nI have been buying and selling automobiles for all of my life.  I have NEVER been this far off in a \""negotiation\"" in my life.\n\nObviously I will never do business with these thieves ever again, and I suggest the same to everyone else."
0,"This is a mediocre pizza place.  Edible, but not great.  I won't throw a hissy-fit going here, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find this place."
0,"Perhaps it was our fault for not having tried Dunkin Donuts before, but my husband and I went and tried the egg and bacon croissant sandwich, plain coffee, a glazed donut and a boston creme donut. Our cashier was friendly and chatty but couldn't answer a single question. \n\nUs: \""Is the iced coffee sweetened with high fructose corn syrup?\"" Her: \""I don't know, it sure is sweet though.\""\nUs: \""What is in the chocolate kreme donut?\"" Her: \""It's really good, I've had 3 today. I don't know, chocolate stuff?\""\n\nNothing was outright disgusting, but it was pretty mediocre. The coffee was so hot that we both burned out tongues and once it cooled down it was so weak and flavorless that neither of us can understand how it possibly beat Starbucks in a fair taste test. Do the people who participated in the test like coffee? \nWhatever. Now we know that we don't like Dunkin, but I'm left wondering how the place is so popular, let alone still in business with such lackluster product, decor and vacuous service."
1,"I see Heather for the Brazilian Wax.  I have tried one other person and I have to say, Heather is really good! She is knowledgable, professional and takes a lot of pride in her work. Personally for me that means a lot and it keeps me coming back as a \""regular\"" customer!"
1,"Best food ever!!! We could literally eat here everyday! The service has been great, as well. We have tried a few different items and all have been mouth watering. My favorite is the miyagi san burger! Fries and sauce are great too. Drinks are great. Food is high quality, restaurant is clean, bathrooms are clean, air conditioned, nice ambiance, fair prices. Everything is awesome here. I definitely recommend this place."
0,Ambience was great but food was very mediocre. The noodles tasted good. I didn't like the Manchurian. Food was very spicy.
1,"It's hard not to give Sakana five stars when the nigiri fish to rice ratio is so overwhelming that you could wrap the rice with the fish. Yes. That's how much fish they give you. Of course, this would mean nothing if the fish quality wasn't also very good. I realized last night that it's the perfect ratio. I enjoy sashimi, but I couldn't do all-you-can-eat without requesting a bowl of rice. At Sakana, I felt like I was eating a long cut of sashimi with a little bit of rice attached for good measure.\n\nThere are a couple things Sakana does that are a little different. First, they serve uni in basic nigiri format as opposed to gunkanmaki (I found that on wiki); in other words, they don't wrap it in nori. That's not a bad thing. Second, rather than give you a whole salmon kama, they serve it up as bite size portions. Not necessarily a bad thing but worth noting.\n\nAYCE sushi dinners are usually a blur. Rather than try to list everything I remember enjoying, I'll just refer you to Tony T's photos. And of course, I cannot forget about dessert. They have the staples like mochi and tempura ice cream, but I decided to get the less common Green Tea Panna Cotta and the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. Both were a great way to cap the dinner."
0,The waiter was great but he just could not do it all MR IHOP \nYOU had one server working the entire floor and one bus guy/ cashier\n Ordered The chicken dinner mashed potatoes....oops sorry we're out of mashed potatoes!!!!   They brought me fries instead. \nWe asked form sugar free syrup....oops....OUT of sugar free syrup Mr IHOP\n\n My omelet was good .....\n\n\nJust want you to know how you are doing.
0,"Had my very first experience with eyelash extensions here in December 2013.  Had a pleasant experience with them being placed, and they looked great but within 2 weeks every single lash had fallen off.  Not that my lashes fell out, but the glue did not hold at all.  I was extremely diligent about following the instructions.  Now after having gone to two other places for eyelash extensions and not having an issue at either one (couldn't get the lashes off if I tried) I know that it's not me, it's the inferior glue that they use."
0,"Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!--First room had bugs, ring around the toilet, rust and a cracked tub. Second room was an upgrade but it was very dusty and there were blood stains around the jacuzzi. Couldn't run the jacuzzi because of a default that automatically turn the shower on. Oh, did I mention the hair and stains on the washcloths? Uber nasty!! \n\nThere's a huge language barrier with housekeeping and it's clear they only spot clean the rooms. Management doesn't care. You can really tell that the staff is there to get a paycheck and they don't care about making your experience a great one. The restaurants and nightlife are the only thing that's happening for the Stratosphere. With so many bad reviews for this and other hotels in Las Vegas, it's becoming clear that Vegas is going downhill. It definitely isn't the same from 4 years ago and beyond. I hardly saw people gambling at this hotel. Really? I think it's time for other cities like Atlanta to create a little Las Vegas. You'll get much better service, better recourse for problems that you may incur and an overall better experience!!"
1,"4 years later still a solid spot for a lunch buffet. \nThey raised their prices a bit from the $8.95 I remember to around $10.50 for lunch but it's still an incredible value. Where else can you find a great mix of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese food all under one roof.\n\nStandouts are\n- Wokked Mushrooms\n- Maki Handrolls\n- BBQ Area\n\nI wouldn't come here for the $18 crab leg dinner free for all but it is a go-to spot for lunch~"
0,"They way they treat locals on a locals/industry night is horrible.  I went solo to meet friends that were there and entered the first half of the general admission line. As I was allowed to get into the 2nd half. One of the not to bright worker in a black suit suddenly has a problem with my DRESS shoes as if they were not dress code. After that matter was settled. I get a call from my friend that they wouldn't let him in line anymore. He is also a local and the time was at 10:50pm.  First they tell him \""Only guest list and locals\"". He replies he's a local then suddenly its now \""Only guest list\"". Now things have just reach its point of ridiculous. To treat locals so poorly is mind boggling on a night which is designed FOR US.  Oh yeah and I work at the shoppes at the Palazzo which is part of Venetian and at our bar, we're suppose to be on good terms with Tao yet they treat me like dirt. Simply amazing."
1,Good price for watch battery repair and super fast!  I stood and waited and it was done in under 2 minutes!
1,"Oh my god. My heart just melts for this place. Just the best customer service from these ppl... The guy and girl who take our orders always remember what it is we order down to the garnish we always request. They have great pad Thai, chicken pang curry to die for, and yummy house fried rice!  The best Thai food place, and the best little ppl running that joint."
1,"This is a pretty unique place to come and have a Four Peaks brew and hang out.  As others have said they don't serve any food, but they do have food trucks. I suggest going when the Short Leash Dogs truck is there.  They don't seem to mind customers ordering Pizza in or bringing their own food so I don't really see it as an issue.  The bartenders and the bouncers are friendly and add to the relaxed atmosphere.   In the corner  there is pretty much every board game you can think of to waste time with friends while enjoying your tasty beverage.  It's a great place to just grab a beer without having to wade through all the people at the much busier restaurant and brewery location."
1,"So to be more specific, this review is for the Ballantyne Hotel's SPA.  I recently received a gift card for the SPA.  I chose to go with the Axiomm Gel Nail Treatment because I have gotten it done before at Polished (Shellac) and hear the Axiomm stays on longer and looks better (obviously I was pumped).\n\nSo making an appt was pretty easy, everyone was really sweet, my nail tech joked around with us and she was funny - and they had water with strawberries in it - who doesn't love prissy water?!  I sure as heck do.\n\nUnfortunately the Gel Treatment was a bust - or at least they didn't do a very good job of applying it because it started peeling and cracking two days later.  BUMMER.  \n\nOn the upside - I gave them a call and told them what happened and they sent me a another certificate for the full refund.... so I can't complain too much.\n\nMy advice?  If you want Shellac or Axxiom, go to Polished!  They do a way better job and it's cheaper.  Spend your money at the SPA on something else!\n\nNot a terrible experience, just a lesson.  Best of luck!"
0,"La Salsita's is o.k. for late night tacos, but the enchiladas, and dry rice and beans that I had yesterday, tasted like a Mexican frozen television dinner.  The menu is a also misleading as it has most meals priced at $6.99 (comes with beans and rice), and then the $4.99 specials.  What they don't tell you is that if you want beans and rice with the special (in this case chicken enchiladas), that it's extra money.  It comes out to $7.40+    For a few dollars more, you can get real Mexican food at Garcia's, or Filiberto's, Humberto's, Julioberto's and all the other Berto's.  There were also flies in the dining areas."
1,"We went to the Green Mango for the first time last week and it was excellent. The curry was exceptionally tasty (and spicy!) and the food was  fresh and delicious. We got quick service and plenty of rice, which is key when the curry is so rich. And It was still warm enough to sit outside on the sidewalk where we could watch the Regents Square crowd go by, which is fun.  Highly recommended - it's our new favorite thai spot in town."
0,"Oh dear.  I can't vouch for the renovated section of the hotel - it was sold out.  I can say I stayed in the un-renovated part of the hotel and it was pretty much the worst.  It bears mentioning that probably 10% of the hotel rooms are renovated.  The Spa Tower, the Habitat Tower and the Shite tower or whatever it was called are not renovated. \n\nThe hotels in Las Vegas have themes: Paris is done in a French motif, Bellagio is some kind of balloon motif, and the Flamingo is done in the stain motif.\n\nWhere to begin?  The heavily stained carpet?  The wallpaper & paint peeling off the bathroom wall?  Yuck.  P.U.   When I was trying to come up with positives for the room, I noted that there was hot & cold running water and also an electrical outlet.  And a window. The outlet turned out to be one of those stretched out ones that your plug just falls out of.  (Insert dirty joke here).\n\nMy friend had a somewhat more cheerful yet un-renovated room, and, I'm not exaggerating here, we had to step over strange, gigantic, sullen-teens to get into and out of her room.  Weird, overfed she-teens converged and just hung out in the door-well of her room.  Was there a Beiber impersonator rumored to be there?  It is a mystery that will remain unexplained forever.\n\nThe pool is lovely.  When the temperature drops to a balmy 104 in the late afternoon, that's when to head over.  The security guards wouldn't let us in - it closes at 6pm.  6pm!!!!  Total BS.  6pm. How bout closing when it gets dark?  Go crazy, Flamingo - stay open til aaaah, 8pm in the summertime.\n\nOH I did give it two stars instead of one because a) the people at the counter really really tried to help and were very very nice.  b) the room for all it's beige-stainness thankfully didn't smell.  I'm curious about the renovated rooms tho, reading the wholly other types of experiences other yelpers had."
1,"Fun  vibe with kids, dogs, and vendors. No one seemed to mind my chihuahua. Some people do let their kids run wild so be forewarned of some bad parenting. Plenty of parking, but walkable for me. Easy to find.\n\nTons of organic produce, meats, and eggs. The sprout guy was reasonable  $10 a bag for mixed spicy sprouts much higher quality than the grocery store. Having said that beware. $4 for a puny bunch of kale is highway robbery and some of the flowers looked half dead at 10am. Bread vendors galore for vegans and gluten free. \n\nA few trinkety vendors but for the most part midrange goods. Got some great handmade pot holders for my kitchen  and Kathy Willis was very helpful and no nonsense about washing instructions. I got an adorable apron too for a good price but the transaction was a little strange. MRS pinafore is a \""label\"" apparently. When I went to try it on she acted like it was a #%+^% Vera Wang original or something. The washing instructions card was also very extensive. If you can handle a little ego stroking, you can get a cute cotton apron for less money than anthropology or world market.\n\nWe will go back."
0,"I ordered one of their \""Gourmet\"" chili cheese dogs since it was my first time here.  While I waited for them to expertly prepare my dog, I read all over the walls about their acclaimed and innovative dogs.  This caused my expectations to rise.  I took it to go and ate it in my Tahoe and at first bite noticed the chili was ice cold and the dog only slightly warmed.  It was so cold that the cheese didn't even melt!   To make things worse, the bun was so inadequate it came apart in my hands as I attempted to eat it.  They had to know the chili was in the chiller so why not even put it under the salamander to warm the whole thing up?  Or how about warming the chili in the micro before service?  I did not take it back I just tossed it and will not return.  No wonder that there was no one else in this place??"
0,Totally disgusting overpriced caesar salad alert!
0,food is nothing exceptional but charges premium price.  BBQ ribs too salty and over  cooked.  chicken is dry.  hate to compare this to KFC.
0,"Just after CES 2010 opened on Thursday, I took a client to this place because we were all staying in the Flamingo.  We arrived around 8:30pm.  At the door, we were informed the kitchen was closed! (what, it's Vegas and its CES).  If we wanted to stay, all we could order was apps and cocktails in the bar area, we were cool with that. \n\nWe went into the bar, ordered the first of what we thought would be many rounds and four apps. Our drinks arrived 10 minutes later and our apps about 10 mins after that.  Just three sips into our drinks, and a few bits into the food,  we were \""informed\"" the restaurant was closing and we needed to leave, \""drink up\"", what the heck, it was ONLY 9pm during CES. \n\nTo help get their point across, they turned up the lights, cut the music and stood over our table until we paid the bill, gulped down our one cocktail and chowed down the apps. \n\nMaybe their early bird specials are better, but I'm not willing to find out.  If you like to eat at 5pm this might be a great place, but if you are like most people who come to LV for a trade show, and don't go out until after 8pm (because you are on the show floor till 6pm), than I recommend you don't come here."
0,"I think it is a bit pricey for a super casual family restaurant.  The kids meals are like $6 each!  Also, as a vegetarian that doesn't care much for pizza the choice was EXTREMELY limited.  I had a dinner salad and a cheese hoagie.  Would much rather eat somewhere else."
1,"Ok...so Sam's Cafe is probably one of my favorite lunch places to go in Phoenix, I would go alone just for the fresh made chips and salsa they bring to your table, the menu items here are quite unique and to say the least are good for the most part.\n\nEvery time I have been to this place they have never been that busy, but I will say there service is lacking, it seems that when ever I go there I get the dyslexic high school waiter who can't remember to bring me my refills I ask for or I get the recovering meth addict that hates life.\n\nI usually end up getting the mushroom and spinach casadia which never disappoints, I like this places ambiance, the only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the service always seems to blow."
1,"I found this place on yelp the other day when i was on a mission to find a place that does those cute little designs on top of their drinks.. haha lame i know. But I came across cartel coffee lab and had to check it out because of the stellar reviews!\n\nWhen I was ordering, I said I wanted a drink with the coolest design and the cashier kindly explained to me that although the designs are cool, that cartels main focus and goal is really on the taste of their coffee and how its made etc.. she recommended a cappuccino for me.\n\nOf course I received a lovely design on my drink, but she was right about the taste! It was so delicious. I've really only had starbucks coffee and the occasional dutch bros, but this place is really exceptional. Best coffee EVER.\n\nI swear I'd be here every day for my coffee fix if they had a drive thru!! lol :)"
0,"I can't believe that this place is even still in business!  We ordered delivery and it took over 2 hrs and 20 minutes to get to us.  When we complained and stated that we should get this for free, they told us no and would only give 50% off.  The pizza was cold and the food was terrible.  This place should be shut down and take a course in customer service.  Not sure how you expect to have a business when you can't give any service or quality assurance!\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY - never again."
0,Turkey burger.... \n\nDidn't finish it it was so bad... Garlic soy glaze edamame were sweet was expecting a salty garlic edamame. Wait they sprinkled it with salt attempting a savory finish.  We should have just eaten by the pool. It's the same food and just as bad of service. At least by the pool you know what type of service you are going to get.
0,"To start with, there is always a line and a wait to get in, even if half the restaurant is empty. You'd think this may be to take the time to clean tables, but unfortunately it isn't. I think they do it to make it look popular to people passing by. \nBack to the cleanliness, or lack thereof - under the table was so dirty that we were accidental kicking debris on each other when simply shifting our feet around. So disgusting! At least they wiped the table and seats down just before we were seated, because hey, what's better than sitting on wet vinyl seats. By the way, there were still crumbs on the seat. \nThe burgers consist of previously frozen patties that aren't very good and pretty decent veggies. Not really what you're looking for when you are dropping this much money on a burger. Just save some money and go up one floor to Mickey Ds. \nTheir other food isn't a great value either. For example, $8 will get you 5 alright onion rings. Stay away from the shakes, unless you aren't picky. \nService was very slow. Ambiance was kind of cool 50s diner, only with a very loud sound system. \nWe felt like we were in a glorified karaoke bar with the waitresses making announcements and singing at odd times. \nThere is no reason to visit this place. You have the golden arches one floor up or IHOP just down the street. Either will be cheaper and have same quality food."
0,Didn't even have a chance to try! We were a group of 12 and you'd think they'd want our business. We were not greeted nicely and seemed frustrated that we were a large group and wanted to sit together. They were not even busy! We went to Whiskey Rose...so glad we did!
0,"This review is if you come here during the day. We parked at a nearby lot and the first hour was free so since this place is pretty boring, we were in and out within that hour. I remember coming here when I was younger and I saw the light show and thought it was cool. I came here during the day and this is a tourist trap. It has no legit restaurants and the casinos are ghetto and not strip status. You will also notice that the crowd tends to be different than what you see on the strip. This is more for chill hill billy type folks and the pace is a lot slower here. You will see tourist shops and street performers but nothing you havent seen before. This is a drive from the strip so if you have a car, go ahead and come here. If you dont, it is not worth the taxi money. I will not be returning and I just wish I had seen the light on the ceiling.\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Do not come here during the day. It is quite boring with nothing to do. Go at night when you can see the light ceiling."
1,"You have to visit this store!  If you love original products that are useful and beautiful check it out!  I recently purchased a back pack from here and took it all over Canada...hiking, biking, fishing and kayaking and it was a champion!  The compartments were great so I could protect my wallet in a crowd...there is a nice water bottle holder as well.  Most of all I can wash it and it is just like new!"
1,"I had lunch here and enjoyed it.  I liked the d\u00e9cor and the ambience.  They were playing some mood music with a beat which wasn't too loud.  I wanted a beet salad and tried their version with prosciutto.  While I was waiting for my salad, they provided me with their bread which was really good.  The rolls were served warm and had a thin skin with a nice, fluffy interior. The butter was soft as well and easily spread on the bread.\n\nI had never had prosciutto with a beet salad but it worked really well.  There was a nice mix of flavors with the sharp taste of the blue cheese blending well with the savory prosciutto with the acidity of the balsamic dressing.  They also had some beans for texture which I think works really well with beet salads in general.  The golden beets were sweet and tasty, but they could have added more beets for color and balance.\n\nMy server was attentive and friendly and service was great overall.  The price was $21 including tip and was good value considering the quality here.  I will have to try the dinner options the next time I am around."
1,"When my boyfriend told me we were heading out to Las Vegas, I swear on my high heels, the first thing I asked was \""CAN WE GO TO M&M WORLD?!?!\"". Ok, it came out more like a squeal/scream, but still. \n\nI'm a huge candy dork. Like way too much. In a weird way. I would rather go to Hershey, PA than Epcot. \n\nAlso, I'm old and one of my favorite candies were the crispy M&M's, and the M-Azing bar. Both are m&m candies, and both have left a hole in my heart (and in my stomach).  \n\nOk, so there's no such thing as M-Azing bars anymore, but I did find out that Crispy m&m's are available in Australia (looks like that's my next vacation!).\n\nOther than that, the whole store is really neat, and the staff isn't jaded or creepy, they're actually really nice. One lady offered to take multiple pictures for us and was super sweet about it the whole time.\n\nI knocked a star for the price, the crowd factor, and the fact that there were no crispies (how do you call yourself M&M WORLD if you don't include all the world's m&ms???).\n\nBut employees are fantastic, the trinkets are neat, and if I would have had to buy silly souvenirs for people, I'd definitely pick them up here."

0,"We just got back from 4 nights and three days in Vegas.  We were very excited to stay in the new City Center, and a non-gaming hotel at that.  We arrived around 9 and had to wait to check in (only one person working the front desk).  We waited about 10 minutes to check in, but the girl at the desk was very friendly, so not a huge deal.  The room (25th Floor) was lovely, though small, with a kitchenette and fridge (have to say, the fridge was nice--big enough to store the drinks that we bought from the CVS).  The coolest thing about the room was the electric shade (sheer and blackout), so we played with those a lot.  The bed stands out--it was heavenly....SO Soft, and the PILLOWS!  Unbelievable.  The decor was nice, particularly the room signs and the handy little light system at the door that let you push a button to get a do not disturb light or a housekeeping light on your doorbell.  \nThat being said, there were no amenities in the hotel--there was one restaurant that only served (a very expensive) breakfast and lunch.  Room service was plastic-wrapped food that you heated up in the microwave.  It was also a haul to the strip, and you had to go to the Monte Carlo to find any affordable places to eat.  The pool was nice, although nothing out of the ordinary, and the food and drinks were incredibly expensive ($10 smoothie, $14 snacks).  The last time we were in Vegas, we stayed at Paris, and I really felt like we got a better experience.  I just felt like it wasn't a good value for the expense, and maybe just not our crowd....next time we'll stay someplace a little bit more fun (Paris was fabulous, Planet Hollywood looks cool, too...)"
0,"This is the worst meal quality I have had in a long, long time. Undercooked green beans, scalloped potatoes, and beef enchiladas. The single high point was the free draft/wine coupon per paid customer."
0,"This is not like Serendipity in NYC. Sure it has the frozen hot chocolate but thats where the similarity stops. Its a bummer since I love the one in NYC so much, and was expecting a bit more regarding the decor and the location. The decor is boring, the one in NYC is exciting to go into with lots of design elements and crazy decor. The location here sits above the strip with only a few seats sitting along the strip to people watch...which the strip is sorely lacking in my humble opinion. If you want a frozen hot chocolate get one and get it to go...sit on the strip and eat it there...more entertaining and more visually appealing. Skip the food, its Cisco quality all the way(mass produced, factory farmed frozen food generally speaking)."
1,"Seeked this place out looking for a sit down, but off the path mexi place.  My wife had a whole fried fish (mojarra) and said it was outstanding.  She thought it could have been cooked a touch more, but that indicates to me that they did it just right.\nKids had carne asada tacos plain, no toppings at their request.  They wolfed them down.\nI had two cheese enchiladas topped with their mole sauce.  It was very good.  Service was polite, sincere and prompt.  I would go back in a heatbeat.  After looking at the bill I was even more enthusiastic about this place.  Great job!\n\nWorthy note:  Besides their delicious salsas, they had my wife's favorite bottled hot sauce on tap (Castillos).  That is a first!\n\nStacky Best Of Award\u2122  Mojarra"
1,"Had a really nice time at this location. I booked it through an Amazon deal but realized there wasn't that big of a price difference between\nLSI regular rates and the Amazon deal.  As for the perks that were supposedly included I could have gotten on my own. Anyways aside from that I loved the junior suite and balcony overlooking the strip. It was really clean and the jacuzzi tub was the perfect size.  On top of that the hotel is connected to the MGM, Signature etc. so there wasn't a need to drive anywhere. Just pack some cute walking shoes, head on out and get your on!"
0,Pizza taste like cardboard and games are horrible. The prizes are just crappy as they get.
0,"Chips, bean dip, and salsa was ok. Green burrito, rice and beans were below average. There was no green chili flavor at all - basically it was a brownish, dull flavor. The meat chunks were tough and not fit to eat. The rice and beans tasted a few days old. Margarita was ok, not much alcohol though. I usually go to Rositas which is right across the street - their green burrito (try it smothered in green sauce and cheese) is 100 x's better than Serranos - in fact every thing is better at Rositas. I will head over to the chandler Serranos and try that next time - hopefully they don't bring their food in from the same place as this one.  Honestly I can't believe this place is still in business. Try Rositas instead for some excellent mexican food."
1,"Ok I am going to give this a 5 star review the food was over the top! The shakes were incredible , they made to order burgers for us which was great, even the Ice Tea for this southern boy was increbile.   The sauces that pair with the onion rings fries and sweet potatoes fries are paired well. The only thing is you have 30 beer taps and only one dark beer on tap come on GR at least change that.  Will definitely come back again"
0,"Went for dinner tonight. Will be last time I\nCome here. Food took forever to be served.Steak was warm, potatoes cold. Just about done with dinner when my napkin fell on floor...went to reach for it and saw a roach crawling on it. Beyond disgusted. Have never encountered that in any restaurant before. Needless to say not coming back."
0,"It could be the worlds best Chinese, but customer service and delivery method are putrid. I placed an order an order and asked for delivery. Order of five meals for friends and myself for dinner, so it is a very profitably delivery. I call an hour and fifteen minutes after the order and they forget my order and say it will be another twenty to thirty minutes. \n\n\nI will never call back and will not be advising any of my friends or coworkers to go there either."
1,"What the what, they have a gambling station in the pool?! Ah, I don't gamble but you can't tell me you're not tempted now!\n\nAt the 21+ bar area, there are also gorgeous waitresses in their bikinis ready to get you some drinks! What the what?!\n\nThe pools here are amazingly decorated. The water is warm all around except for the pool in the shade by the 21+ area, it's a little chilly even in 95 degree weather. But I mean in 95 degree weather, you'll only stay wet for like 5 minutes after you get out.\n\nLying around by the pool is extremely relaxing. Why wouldn't you come out here?! Although, seats fill up fast, so you might want to come early!\n\nOooh yeah, so you have to pay for the seats with cushions, whatttt the wahttt?! But I'm lucky. And my friend, who stays there frequently, got me on that and the drinks!\n\nAwesome!!! Is there a more perfect day? I can't describe it!\n\nMy only complaint, how clean is water where they let 21+ roam with drinks in their hands?"
0,"The wife wanted to experience all her favorite TV chef's cuisine during our recent trip to Vegas so we ventured to Bobby' Flay's burger joint for stop #1. \n\nI expected more, especially for the lofty price. What we got was a couple of decent burgers, but nothing we couldn't get at a dozen other burger places, honestly I think Johnny Rockets has a much better burger. I got the Bobby's blue, and I am shocked to hear myself say this, because I love cheese, but this had too much cheese. Could not taste the juiciness of the burger it was so drowned in cheese. My wife had the classic which looked to me to be a fairly run of the mill burger. \n\nWe also ordered a half and half fries and onion rings and were presented with an anemic order of fries that was barely enough for 1 and TWO onion rings. The onion rings were not even the same size, bringing the spectre of conflict into the picture as the two patrons must then choose who gets the bigger one. C'mon, two freaking onion rings? This was a $5 side order and was supposed to be half and half. Perhaps the other half dozen onion rings were MIA, I don't know. \n\nService wise, the place was empty, but somehow our burgers came out 5 mins in advance of our drinks. Unacceptable. As for drinks, I ordered a strawberry shake, which taste wise was fine, but here again, the glass was not very large, it didn't come out with the metal carafe with the rest of the shake, and for 9 bucks I would have expected a hell of a lot more. \n\nSummary, unless you are absolutely dead set on trying a Flay spot, pass on his palace, its extremely poor value, mediocre service and palatable but rather ordinary food.\n\nEdit: I did get an almost immediate response from the BBP social media person promising they would address the shortcomings in my review with the LV location management. I will not change my review, but kudos to the social media manager for being on top of their feedback."
0,"Very disappointed last night.  I have heard for years how fabulous Postinos is so last night my wife and I drive half an hour over to Postino's east to have dinner with friends.   We put our names in for a table for 4 for first available, and were told 45 minutes.   An hour and 40 minutes later we were still waiting for a table.   After inquiring inside they offered a table that was so wet from the over zealous misting system that water was running off the table.   All the host could offer at that point was for us to wait for -the next- table.\n\nI could have driven to Flagstaff an had dinner in the time this transpired.   We left the restaurant hungry and mad, never having eaten at 8:45ish.\n\nNever going back.     Too many other restaurants in the valley to choose from."
0,If you are in a hurry do not use advantage. There were three people in front of me and 1 hour later I am still waiting in line.
0,I deposited a check in bank of america atm before 8pm last night. The check was a little over $2200. It was written from a bank of america business account. They put a hold on the check for 1 week even though it was drawn on a bank of america account. They already debited the account it was written off of. They will not let my boss cancel the check yet they will not give me the money til the 4th. So why are they holding my money for 1 week. I put a check in last week and it cleared the next day. This makes no sense. I have started a srew bank of america facebook group that is growing by leaps and bounds. Take my advice & the hundreds of others in the group and dont use this bank. The worse part about it was the smug attitude of the manager. Join the fb group & let these bastards know that our business is a privledge and not a right!
0,we don't know why this place has such a great reputation. it's loaded with hipster douches and assholes with attitudes who all look like lumberjacks.\n\nboring. \n\nit's just not that cool. the oysters are good though. free appetizers for happy hour on sunday. that's pretty much the only time to go. there's also never any place to sit on a busy night. dumb.\n\nit's the shady's of tempe.

0,"If I could give zero stars I would. Ok, ordered three urgent shipments of required computer components from NewEgg(with 3 day paid shipping mind you). First package was supposed to come by the 6th of the month. Got an update saying they needed the gate code to the condo's (ok, kind of understandable, though all the other carriers have never needed it). So they say the will deliver nest day. Next day rolls around and at the end of the day they update the delivery saying they could not deliver because the address is wrong. I called them and they said that the apt number had been cut off the label. So they say they will prioritize my shipment for first thing the next morning. (OK, kind of sucks, but whatever at least i'll get it first thing in the morning.) Next day rolls around and i'm about to leave for class at noon... No package, no update, no nothing. Get home from class at 6:00 pm. Nothing. So I call them. They say they lost the %$#ing package. At this point i open a claim with newegg and order some other parts and a replacement for the replacement that was just lost. OK. Let me just say that it is now the 12th of the same month and i still have no packages. To keep this from going on forever I will summarize the other two shipments. Second order had the gate code issue again then couldn't deliver cuz I wasn't there and then was lost in the same fashion as the first, despite me calling them on the morning of the first delivery attempt to confirm that they had the key code, and the full address (which they read back to me). Package is still lost. I'm supposed to get the replacement replacement package (third shipment) today. I have absolutely no doubt that they will F it up again despite me calling them last night and telling them painfully clear exactly what I want them to do. I am just going to stop this review here as I truly feel that i have justified the 1 star(zero desired) rating I have given.\n\nWhy would any self respecting company would use Ontrac as their shipping co is absolutely beyond me and insane in every sense of the word."
1,This place is so good the chicken is great . I always get the lemon lime and the fries are to die for yes I said it . I always love how the servers have a great attitude they actually interact with you all the time and make you feel  comfortable . The place is always clean. Also
1,"The roasted veggie salad is amazing, especially with the grilled chicken. Don't even need the dressing it comes with, the veggies and their seasonings is all you need. The sample plate- where u get hummus, falafal, pitas, etc is AMAZING. Love it."
1,"- Nicest casino in downtown.  Cool shark-tank that their pool's slide goes thru.\n- I'd give 'em 5 stars but it's always a hassle to park in their lot (which is not free unless you jump thru some hoops), even when I'm going there to visit my friend who's staying/playing at the Golden Nugget."
1,"I have to say as far as chain restaurants go I've been pretty happy w Chili's.  I go for lunch at least once a week and have never had a problem with bad service.  \n\nI also LOVE that they don't allow children in the bar area, and don't allow smoking either.\n\nThe menu is typical American fare and the prices are decent.\n\nAll in all, can't complain."
0,We expected this to be an ABBA review and they mixed it with other songs.  The chairs are all on the same level so you can't see past the person in front of you even though the stage is raised.  The songs were not done well at all but the performers I feel did give 110%.  The performance was a real dissapointment and they had several people who walked out in the middle.  There are a lot of better shows on the strip than this one like Jersey Boys.
1,"Oh my god, Romados, you are so damn good. How I have missed you. Went on a Friday night after a little tennis session and the place, as usual, had a line out the door. Lucky for my friend and I, we were smart and remembered my tip #2 from my last review. In case you didn't see/read it, it's call ahead of time. Why? 'Cause then you get to skip to my lou to the line to the right and are out the door in 10 minutes instead of waiting for an hour in longing/hatred of the people skipping the line. \n\nWe took our orders of 1/2 spicy chicken and fries deliciousness to Jeanne Mance park as the weather was gorgeous and proceeded to chow down. It was heaven - chicken moist and tender as usual and so, so many fries. Almost endless. It always makes me chuckle how they give you a \""side\"" portion of salad...yeah right, if you want vegetables, you are in the wrong place bubba.\n\nAnyways, for $9.75, you cannot go wrong. Still one of my favourite places in Montreal."
0,Maybe it's a slow day...but we are here plus one other person. The guy sitting next to us had to ask for his sandwich to be microwaved...then when she brought it back he had no napkins and everyone was too busy on their cell phones in the kitchen for him to ask for a napkin. He literally had to reach in his pocket for a napkin. The cook did finally get us a beer...but waited on us with kitchen gloves on and handled our money. Not the amazingly friendly service the sign describes.
1,"Great environment, great food, great everything. Except they have an oompa loompa...and that's hella weird."
0,"Drink the Cream Soda - don't eat the food.  Seriously.  \n\nI want to like this place - Sprecher Cream Soda is my favorite \""craft\"" soda of all TIME.  I lived in IL for 10 years and would seek it out in every grocery store I could.  I was super excited when we moved back to the Madison area and lived near the Sprecher. **Disclaimer - I don't eat meat!** The first time we ate there was in the restaurant, where I ordered their version of Mac and Cheese. I have eaten a lot of Mac and Cheese in my day - this was nothing to write home about. In fact, it was pretty sad, considering Sprecher is a WI company and should specialize in WI things like CHEESE.  The second time we had carryout, and I got a Margherita Flatbread. I kind of feel like it's hard to screw up pizza - but even this was lackluster. It was soggy and the ingredients were definitely not fresh. I wouldn't say it tasted bad, but it definitely didn't taste good.  I can't speak for our guests, because they aren't going to admit that they didn't enjoy the meal we just fed them, but I know both of my husband's meals were \""just okay\"" - with the exception of his Fish Dinner, which he did love. In MY opinion, the menu here has SO much promise - I just wish it was executed better."
0,"What the hell happened to this place?\n\nI used to love Chino Bandido... their wacky Mexican/Asian combos seemed to give me consistent mouth-gasms every time I'd go there. Within the past year or so however something changed, the staff went way downhill and the resulting food that comes out of the kitchen is a sad and pathetic shadow of what it used to be. \n\nJust to illustrate this point, I decided to give this place another shot a few weeks ago and upon walking in (the place was empty by the way) I was greeted with a \""wassup' by the main kid at the register... nothing more than that... just \""wassup\"" with a look on his face like I was a rival gang member entering into hostile territory... not very welcoming to say the least. \n\nAfter ordering my combo dish 'to go'... I was treated to about a 15 minute wait, and while I was waiting the three kids working in the kitchen were rapping with each other. Some of the words coming from their mouths are probably too harsh to include in this review. It was obvious that they were paying no attention to my food that was cooking. It was so uncomfortable to be sitting there that long, staring at a group of clueless kids making fools out of themselves... I almost walked out without my food even though I had already paid; because let's be honest... the chance of this food being decent at this point was near zero in my mind. \n\nAfter my long wait, and being handed my bad of food by one of the delinquent-looking employees (who by the way didn't mutter a single word when giving me my dish or when I left)... I went home to uncover what horrors awaited me in that styrofoam container. Let me just tell you my friends, it was not pretty. It looked like someone had taken an ice cream scooper and just plopped a pile of beans on top of a soggy tortilla and rice... then put in on the floor and stepped on it. It was a mushy pile of greased up nothingness... no substance, just a poor excuse for a pile of food that could be mistaken for animal excrement.\n\nBy no means should you go here, unless they revitalize this place or hire some new staff... so this is your warning; avoid the Chandler location like the plague!"
1,A nice lunch place. If you want something healthy with some flavor and won't break the bank this place is A-1. The staff was nice so I'm not sure where those comments of unfriendly staff came from. The chicken was very well cooked & didn't feel weighed down after eating it. Will go back again.
0,"Fantastic museum - clean, classy, airy but horrible service.  My husband refused to put his sticker on him and didn't give it to me either.  Soon we parted ways.  Eventually I was stopped by their security and told that I couldn't wonder around.  Then she told me I \""need to look for my husband.\"" Hello? Should I go back in wondering around again? Everybody who works in the museum carry a walkie-talkie - makes me wonder if they are used for work at all.  Heaven forbid if I had children and one of them got lost.  On top of that, she gave me an attitude.  So yes, great museum, lousy service."
0,"Eek! Methinks not was exactly what I was thinking when walking around the buffet area. My boyfriend has been staying at the Las Vegas Hotel for our budget trips and the casino gave us two complimentary buffet passes for dinner. They were FREE buffet passes, but I am still giving it one star. The regular price for dinner was around $21.00 per person and that is definitely NOT worth the price for this buffet.\n\nFood: \nOrange Chicken: Their orange chicken is pretty much microwaved chicken nuggets with an orange syrup sauce. If I had the palette of a three year old, I would have maybe enjoyed this.\nChow Mein: It was a joke. There was chow mein all over the floor and counter. \nCarne Asada Meat: Dry and no flavor.\nSteamed Dumplings: This is probably the one thing that I could eat at the buffet that had a decent flavor and texture. I think I ate 6 dumplings.\nFried Chicken: The batter was overly crispy and the chicken meat was super dry. I couldn't finish it. \nPasta: There is a pasta bar that reuses the cocktail shrimp. There was nothing that special about it.\nIce Cream: The ice cream is a soft serve vanilla or chocolate which wasn't that special. It pretty much melts straight up when it lands in your ice cream bowl. \n\nService: The ladies here were nice but they also seemed to have the same sentiments that I did in wanting to be at the buffet. \n\nAnd to top it all off? I got a nice old stomach ache when I left the buffet and chowed down on some pepto bismol pills to help my stomach process all of the crappy food that I just ate. \n\nBottom line: I went here for free but I probably wouldn't come back if you paid me. There is a McDonalds down the street, I'd rather dine there and get my $2.22 Big Mac."
0,"Don't bother. Far too expensive for what you get - two dollars per small botlle of water? Really? No wait staff, no booze, bad sound, terrible music choices....I planned on booking a room for four hours, spent barely an hour and a half and went to the bar next door instead. Won't be going back. They need to learn what good private room karaoke is, there are plenty of examples just sadly not in Arizona."
1,"I had a great time here and the only complaint I got was the place being too small for the amount of people they let in. The music was great, a lot of attractive people and everyone seemed to be having a blast. We got bottle service which came with nice comfy seats that fits four in front of one of the pools. For the boos, we got blended redbull vodka which was bomb! Never had it blended before.. The strawberry vodka was also refreshing and tangy.\n\nIf you want to party daytime, this is one spot you want to hit up."
1,"Another fun thing at the Bellagio (after the Fountains) that is beautiful, fun and FREE!  Each display varies by season.  I liked the one I saw in June 2009 better than end of March 2010.  An employee informed me that the garden peaks at certain times (a few weeks after I was there -- the tulip bulbs had just been planted) and that makes sense.  The gorgeous floral displays remind me of the Rose Parade in Los Angeles on New Year's day.  I've grown up watching it every year, so it's fun to see something similar in Vegas.  I bring my camera and take lots of pictures.  It's quite relaxing if it's not too crowded.  CHECK IT OUT!"
0,"I really wanted to like Vegas Hot! Yoga & Pilates Studio.  They have a ton of classes but somehow I never can find one that fits my schedule.  As Rebecca R. said If you want to go early in the morning or later in the evening you should be good but with my schedule it's impossible to find afternoon class that will work for me.  Also, beware they are very strict about their late entry policy, I was 2 minutes late once (Boo!!  Vegas traffic) and I was not allowed to join the class.  Sad times, I wish the girl at the desk would've been a little less rude about letting me know I was late.  I was just trying to get my workout on.\n\nBetween the class schedule not fitting with mine and and the studio being across town from the condo, I am definitely looking for another place to do yoga.  Also, as another Yelper said, the studio can smell like dirty gym socks sometimes."
1,Their Pad Thai is very good as well as many other meals that come in a variety of spicy.  Dinner is very quiet and service is personable and prompt.  They are very nice people and the price is reasonable if not cheap.
0,"The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty good. Friendly staff,  but bad service during non - happy hour time. 2 tables were only being served (including our's), but it seems that our server is you busy chit-chatting with other waiters. Ordered Spider roll, not as what I expected from the reviews. Oxtail soup what ok, bland. Can't go wrong with mango mochi, just well presented in a plate. Also, we didn't know we are 10 minutes before happy hour until I heard the other party next to our table. The waitress gave them an option if they're ordering for happy hour, they can wait for a couple of minutes.  That's our waitress,  but she never gave us that option. Anyway, if you have time to drive a few minutes for a great Oxtail soup, I'll go to California Hotel & Casino instead."
1,"Give your typical day a rating from 1 to 10 (10 being the highest of course). Then eat the Original Philly Sandwich from Philly's Famous. Your day is now a 10! These sandwiches are so tasty, it's unbelievable. I visited Philadelphia about 12 years ago and have been looking for a sandwich to match what I had eaten there. Well it's here and waiting for you in Chandler. Northwest corner of Alma School and Ray. \nTry it out and you will be back. Tell and bring friends to support this local and very tasty business. \nHere's to my next 10 day!"
0,"My previous review was for an oil change, which I still stand by.  This time I brought in my car because it was making a rattling noise.  I was told that the bracket holding my flex tube was broken and it would be around $350 to replace the whole pipe.  The pipe itself was not damaged and I asked if there was a cheaper option to attach the pipe back to the car (either by welding it or creating a new bracket). The mechanic gave me a rude answer about coat hangers.  \n\nI called around and was quoted $200 to replace the pipe at Speedys Muffler. When I brought it in there to get it replaced, they told me the pipe itself could just be bracketed to the car for $45. \n\nMake sure you call around before getting work done here in case there are other repair options that Chet's didn't consider."
0,"Great location... That'st about it! \n\nCentrally located on the strip, great view of the High Roller Wheel and once outside of the hotel great nightlife atmosphere. Very close to Starbucks and a variety of food choices. \n\nThe hotel itself is old! We were up on the 16th floor which only had 1 functioning elevator and we weren't sure it was going to work each time we got on! \nThe carpets in the hallway are filthy, no ventilation in the bathroom. The beds were ok.\nI will say that the housekeeping staff was very friendly and did a great job in cleaning the rooms.\n\nUpon arrival we were informed only one free Wifi code was given which could only be used by one person on the same device for the entire stay. Not to mention the connection was horrible. \nWe had to pay to print out our boarding passes at check-out."
0,"If you want the most expensive, least bang for your buck, biggest ripoff of a restaurant you can imagine, come here.  $8 for a bowl of soup (3-4 spoonfuls)?  My Chinese ancestors, preaching a culture of frugality, are rolling over in their graves.  I hate this place for making me feel so unjustified for spending that money...and seeing as that's all you do in Vegas w/ gambling and partying, for the Noodle Shop to be my biggest loss that weekend is just sad."
0,"My cousin, husband and I came to this place because the Main Street Station buffet had a super long line.  Bad idea.  The service was terrible.  The waitress took forever and did not give a rat's a** that she did.  We all ordered the Choice Cut Ribeye Steak.  Huge mistake!  I got the teriyaki style and my cousin and husband got the cowboy broiled steaks.  You could definitely tell these were cheap steaks.  I mean seriously cheap like found dead on the road or something.  Terrible, terrible tasting!  And what teriyaki sauce??  I mean can't they just get it from the jar?  Ugh seriously one of the worst steaks we have ever tasted.  The baked potatao was bleh and the green beans were soft and mushy.  I guess I should have known when I seen the sour cream come in a packet.  I gave this place one star for the beer.  I got the High Roller Gold which was pretty good."
0,"Stayed in the suite in the old power. \nOld equipment, old torn carpets. rooms were spacious but would not stay in CP again."
0,Thought I would give them a 2nd chance... Bad idea! Employees make you feel like your putting them out for ordering overpriced pizza. this place will be out of business If  the owners don't  make a change quickly.
1,"Heard a lot of high regard for the place and I figured wife and I would be disappointed and didn't feel like waiting in the line.  Figured it was more hype than actual goodness.  I was wrong.\n\nThe wait was probably 30 minutes, but the beer selection and the ability to get the beers in different sizes made the wait a non-factor.\n\nSat at the bar and the prices were more than reasonable with very laid back friendly service.  Not the world's best BBQ, but very good.  The atmosphere learns a lot to the senses and I enjoyed the meal.  The smoked sweet potato was a perfect side dish.  Rib tips were not the meatiest tips I've had, but very good.  Wife had the brisket and was impressed.  Not too moist, not too dry, the way she likes it.\n\nServing size isn't huge, but enough to fill the belly after some beers.  Definitly a worth while visit.\n\nGreat staff, service, atmosphere, beer, and food.  What else could I ask for, I guess I paid the cheap Urbana parking meter, but I'm sure there is a free lot and I think the parking is free after hours."
0,"Very nice store, but I was completely caught off guard and it wasn't even busy. No line, not crowded so I don't understand but your employees Zeke & Hector had the worse attitude. SMH. Never felt so disrespected as a customer in my life. Very disappointed especially I light of the quality service Starbucks is known for. They seemed more concerned about what was happening behind the counter than providing quality service. And I guess it would help if they liked what they were doing. Seemed like Zeke would've preferred to be somewhere else. Ok I'm done. SMH. \n\nMaybe I'll give this store another shot in the future but for now I'll drive across town of I have to in order to get quality service from another Starbucks store."
0,"This is the Post Office closest to my home.  It is convenient to just drop something off at but it is WAY too busy to try and send something from package wise...I wouldn't want to stand in this line!  Seems everyone working here and going here is rude as well.  Hmmmmm.  Well, it works for quickly dropping stuff at."
1,"I brought my Moen white/ brass roman tub spout to be refinished brushed nickel to match my recently updated bathroom fixtures. Unfortunately, I discovered after leaving the tub project for last, Moen no longer makes a replacement for older spouts. My only options were to replace the entire tub and fixtures for $1000, keep the old fixtures that clashed with the new ones or have the spout re-plated.\n\nI was reluctant to use Papago Plating after reading some of the reviews on Yelp, but went ahead with the order anyway. If you are looking for immaculate antiseptic office\nthis may not be the place for you. However, the business looks like a typical small job-shop one might find anywhere. The lady that waited on me was very pleasant, knowledgeable and accurate with the final cost and completion date. It took one week and only cost $42. \n \nWow! Papago Plating did a fantastic job. The spout matches the new tub handles perfectly."
0,"Tried this place for lunch, they have an AYCE special for 10 bucks. Didn't have high expectations but you never know. For the ten you can get basic rolls and nigiri; spicy tuna roll, california roll, etc. I normally don't order those types of rolls, which was fine because most special rolls were just 3 or 4 dollars more. Which is a great idea get them in the door and then up sell your better rolls. So I made my order, a spicy tuna roll and one of their special rolls. It wasn't busy at all yet it took some time to get my order. The waitress was attentive and it's a very clean and nice place. When my order came I sat there and looked at it trying to find the sushi. You see this in lower end AYCE sushi houses, they make the rolls where the rice is a half of an inch thick if not thicker, and the center where the fish should be is smaller than half an inch in diameter. So your mainly getting filled with rice which means you eat less and they save money.Ultimately they lose money because who wants to go back? They get you that first time and then they wait for the next person to see the $ 10 AYCE sign and the cycle starts all over again. Which if you read other reviews or tips that's exactly what got them to come in.Its sad because its not that hard give the customer what they want."
0,"I missed this place last time I came to Vegas so this time I was determined to go here. 35 as I expected . I thought that this place must be amazing.\nOur hostess had no personality and did not make us feel welcomed. We sat down in 35 and got a patio seating. I was thrilled. This is when it went down hill. Our server apparently touched our table and said she would be there in a minute . I didn't even know who she was. 25 min went by and still no server. This place obviously doesn't have team work because NO ONE came by. My friend pointed out our server and she just kept walking circles around us. I had to ask te host to find our server for us ( where she said yes but felt is necessary to keep setting tables). GUEST ARE YOUR 1st PRIORITY!! We asked to see a mgr. Who kindly expedited our food out quickly. Our runner ( older blonde) was friendly and and made sure we had everything thing. Our server never came by to check on us . O refills. Never smiled. Ugh! It just made the whole experience aggravation! I was irritated and never wanted to come back here again. Then , she had the nerves to put a 18% grat. F' her! Why should I reward terrible service . The only reason she got a tip is because 1 of my friends felt bad. I left 0 tip on my share and same withe others around me! Older middle aged lady with brown hair! WORST SERVER AWARD to her!\nThe star goes to the runner and he deep fried Oreos !"

1,"O is all the things you love about the Olympics rolled into 1 show: Diving & gymnatics. And if syncronized swimming and clown acts are your faves, well, added bonus.\n\nDo yourself a favor and read the website or wikipedia about the show. Almost everyone in my party was confused about what the hell was going on. There's a back story, but not.\n\nHave ADHD? This show is for you! There are sooooooooooooo many things going on at the same time - I wasn't sure where to focus my attention!\n\nThe auditorium is supposed to be a sort-of replica of an ancient theater. Unfortunately, if you're in the 300 section, row 2 and above, you miss some of the show. The clowns do something down below, I could only see a bit of it without risking falling to my death. Good thing I hate clowns!"
0,"**NOTE the VERY restrictive Outside Food Policy**\n\nThe hotel is nice and the staff is okay.  You must be wondering why the two star review then.\n\nThe biggest beef I have is their outside food policy.  I understand not being able to bring things in to a restaurant or concert venue but not have never been denied bring some snacks and drinks to my room.  I did know the policy going in but we wanted to stay the night there after a concert.  Below is the outside food policy and note that it excludes ALL food except medicine and a small cooler for kosher foods.\n\n\""In order to maintain a safe environment, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino prohibits coolers; boxes; bags; or other containers for the purpose of transporting food and beverage on property. In addition, all outside food and beverage is also prohibited.\"" \n\nThe guy at the elevator searched everyone going up and I witnessed someone having an unwrapped candy bar taken away.  The guard really embarrassed the guy to and threatened to have him kicked off the property for violating the outside food policy.  \n\nThis is the reason I rate this place two stars.  It is their attitude not to allow you to bring any food or drink to your room. I would be okay with them restricting things but to exclude everything is insane.  I would have liked to bring some snacks and beverages like I do for every other hotel stay."
0,these guys kept my engine for 4 months and never delivered on their promises. search the 240 forums and ripoffreport.com  you'll see what others are talking about. In the end this place ended up costing me 5 months of delays and around $1200 in additional costs.
1,Hesitant to come here at first despite all the good reviews. It's just the concept of paying for a meal where the star attraction is the noodles and the dipping sauce it comes in just isn't that appealing. I'm used to a bowl of noodles where the broth is the highlight of the dish or the ingredients are and the noodles just complement as well as add some filling in the bowl.\n\nBeing this was my first time at I-Naba i opted to try the evening's tasting menu which was a 4 course dinner for 18. Portions were small which reflects traditional Japanese style. I didn't remember to take a picture of the tasting menu. With that in mind i'm going to describe what came out without knowing their proper names or the other option available.\n\n1st course - braised mackrel \nServed cold which was a surprise to me but still pretty good. The sauce they braised in it was light and refreshing and paired quite nicely with the mackrel \n\n2nd course - deep fried shrimp with a hunk of fish cake attached to it served with fried tofu and eggplant in sauce\nThe fish cake is very Japanese which is the only way i can describe it. Flavored with herbs and heavy with course cuts of vegetables. not exactly what i was expecting with it comes to fish cake but it was still nice. \n\n3rd course - Bowl of udon soup with slices of rib eye\nEven though this place is known for it's soba noodles the udon is excellent. The broth was light and refreshing as well as complemented the udon noodles quite well.\n\n4th course - shaved watermelon ice with sesame ice cream\nThe sesame ice cream had honey drizzled over it and was a small scoop but packed a very rich and pleasant sesame taste. They did an excellent job shaving the watermelon ice as it wasn't prone to melting quickly and had a rich watermelon taste.\n\nNot exactly what i was expecting at all when i came here but will gladly return.
0,"Cute concept but the food was awful and we left not feeling well.  My son even threw up his meal. :(  they go so far out of their way to be unhealthy that it is gross!!!!!  Milk shakes actually come with a pad of butter on top. When you take a bite your mouth feels coated with butter.  The french fries, cooked in lard were soggy. So.... soggy lard fries = disgusting.  The burgar was not bad but not great.  Like any frozen Patty would taste.  The only plus was that the bacon was crispy.  The cute points....  waitresses dressed like nurses.  You are given a wrist band and a hospital gown when you walk in and if you dont finish your food you can get a spanking from a \""hot nurse\""  the wine comes in an IV bag and they have shoy glasses that look like pill bottles.  I think they could keep their concept and focus a little more on quality and less on trying to kill their customers with artery clogging ingredients.  It is possible to be unhealthy AND good and I think they failed at that."
0,"was not very pleased with my visit, I was made to wait longer than my Appt time by a half an hour showed up 15 min early for paper work so a total of 45 min,  only to be given a hard time because I didn't have  a not from my Dr because I was pregnant (which I asked if I needed when I made the appt and was told no) I then saw the Dr and was basically told they could do nothing for me I explained I was in a lot of pain and he didn't even give me a script for antibiotics to get rid of the infection from the abscess tooth, all they did was take one x ray and never even gave my mouth an exam. Front lobby was dingy and not well kept the light in the bathroom was out and basically I really feel I was not treated as well as some of the other patients in the office. ( I felt like they catered specifically to the Latin population ) I will be looking for a different Dentists ASAP. I can say one of the girls in the lobby who then also served as my hygienist was very sweet and that is why I gave them 2 starts instead of one. But save yourself time and frustration go else where."
1,"We went here for the first time tonight.  We frequent two other fro-yo places that are in the area, but this one is closer to our home and new, so we decided to check it out.\n\nUpon walking in, it was very clean and bright.  Lots of open space and plenty of seating.  \nRight away I was happy to see that they offer a very small kids cup.  This is great for me because it is easier to keep my kids portions smaller this way.  Yay!  \n\nThe topping selection was smaller than a nearby place, but there was quite a bit of variety. Since Easter was this past weekend, there were several Easter candy varieties to choose from.  \n\nThere was quite a backup to get to the toppings and to the registers, as there was only one girl working the register.  There are 2 registers available, and it might make better sense to have both running.  \n\nThere was a sign on the front door listing all the promotions that they offer during the week.  20% off one day, BOGO another, etc.  I was happy to see this, as their regular pricing at 42 cents/oz is a bit higher than other nearby places.  Normally for my family of 5 we'd drop about $20 for a fro-yo outing.  But the smaller kids cups, combined with the Tuesday promotion of BOGO, we spent a whopping $7.  Yeah.  Mommy Likes that!\n\nWe'll go back.  Especially on a promo night to save a few bucks."
1,"I didn't stay at the Aria (but plan to next month, so I'll update if I do), but it is the closest casino to the Vdara.  My husband and I really enjoyed the casino here.  We aren't huge gamblers by any means, but it was nice to sit in a casino and not reek of smoke when we left.  They must seriously circulate the air because it never smelled like smoke!  We loved that.  I also liked that this casino isn't nearly as large as some of them, so you're much less likely to get lost.  Since the hotel is new, everything looks clean and fresh."
1,"I love this place... and I'm slightly bias because I come here so much everyone in this joint knows me by name. Don't get fancy and try to order thai or chinese food here. Stick to the Vietnamese food. I like their pho, pork chops and cubed steak. This place does get a little rowdy the later it gets into the AM (partiers) Can't beat that it's 24hrs!"
1,"This establishment is grimy in the best way possible. Like the kind of grimy where you walk in and realize more focus probably goes into the food than the paint on the walls. \n\nFollowing a recommendation, we had the must-eat smoked meat sandwich and poutine. This was the first time I ever had a smoked meat (beef in this case) sandwich and I must say, it was AMAZING. Very simple assembly- lots and lots of meat between two slices of bread and a swipe of mustard. We ordered the \""upgraded\"" plate so it came with coleslaw, a pickle, and poutine. The poutine was also quite good. \n\nDefinitely a touristy, oft-recommended restaurant, but worth it."
1,"I've always heard people talk about this restaurant and finally made it up there last night. It was packed for a Tuesday night and food was really yummy. When we first sat down they brought roasted garlic and balsamic/olive oil. The waitress suggested a great glass of wine and we picked our plates. We shared the frites, quail lettuce wraps, the gnocchi, Korean beef and the chocolate cupcake for dessert. The frites needed something, perhaps it was just missing ketchup? The quail wraps were spicy and gingery, the gnocchi was wonderful full of mushrooms and delicious chicken. The Korean beef was really nice on a fried white rice, like actually deep fried. The cupcake was really yummy. It seemed to have two kinds of chocolate in it and the meringue was light as melted marshmallows."
0,"Nothing to run home to mom about. Stopped in the other day after driving by this place so many times. A fan of teriyaki bowls and after seeing the $3.49 special sign, I decided to stop in. I'm never one to shy away from hole in the wall food and thought the $4 was worth it. A bit dark when you walk in. There was a guy sitting at a table to the left. When I walked in he got up and went behind the counter and turned on the lights above the food. Looked like they had a decent lunch rush so they must be pretty popular in the area (only know this because the trays were pretty empty and the register had a lot of receipts still attached to it. So I though I may have just stumbled upon something good. Ordered the bowl and he went into the back to fill up the to-go bowl with white rice. He came back out to front trays and topped off my rice with a bunch of teriyaki chicken. Not a bad portion for $3.50. The meat was actually pretty tender and juicy but lacked much flavor. Definately needed more teriyaki sauce. The rice was fine, no complaints.\nNot a horrible spot, might give it another try and have a combo so I can try the other items they have. I wouldn't recommend going outside of prime hours as the food probably sits. I stopped in around 1:30pm. \nI only give 2 stars because nothing stood out about the meal or the place and the guy was grumpy and looked almost pissed off he had to get up to help me. I even left a dollar tip and it looked like it killed him when he mustered up a half-hearted \""thank you\""."
1,"Went here on the recommendation of a friend. Place was slightly busy with other customers so i had to wait a few minutes.\n\nThe assistant manager came to help me out, inspect my current tires, write down make and model, mileage, and ask me the basic questions of driving style, what am i looking for, any problems with the current tires.\n\nI did my research in advanced and had a specific brand and type off their website and a competitor's for price matching. I presented my findings and the competitor's website and the manager didnt give me any attitude or excuses on why i should pay their full price instead of save money.\n\nThe tires i wanted were sold that morning and they didnt have any in stock so he pulled up a higher end set price matched it and offered it to me. End result being a better set of tires at the same price as the set i wanted in the beginning.\n\nHe did try to sell me a set of rims but after a few nos and not really interested at the moment he got a hint and moved on.\n\nThe wait was about an hour long. The waiting area had various magazines but all in the same theme automotive with a few women's magazines mixed in. Free cold water bottles in a fridge and a high end pod style coffee machine. \n\nOverall great service, not that much hassle and i'm pretty happy with the results."
0,Went to craftsteak with a group of about 7 people.  The steak and pork were overdone and way too salty.  We had all been to our share of steak houses in NY and it just seemed like the prices were not justified by the food.
1,"The food was incredible. I ordered a gyro and it was awesome. I am glad  I am local, so I can go back again! The staff was friendly and the place was very clean. This is hit with me and my husband. I will be telling friends."
1,"We stayed here with our 13yo during his spring break, last week.  The hotel is beautiful but very crowded.  I really liked our room which over looked the fountains.  They are amazing and especially at night, worth the extra amount we spent to get that view.  The bed was very comfortable.  We ate at the buffet for 2 breakfasts and one late lunch/dinner.  It was very good and the staff was friendly and efficient.  I personally didn't care for Vegas but not because of the hotel.  Not impressed with the pool(s) or the paid wi-fi.  I complained, nicely about it, couldn't download a thing or get email (!) and they refunded 2 days out 3, which was unexpected but very much appreciated.  They also let me use their computer to check-in for our flight and print boarding passes for free.  It is in the center of the Strip and the airport is only 10-15 minutes away, so use a cab and not one of those shuttles.  The cab was about 1/2 price in comparison.  We did use the monorail and the 2-day bus pass, which were both good but the bus is probably a better deal in the long run."
0,Came in at 11am and no one was inside asked barber for a hot shave he seemed to be inconvenienced by this and said I don't have time for this it's too busy today :/ need I say no one was in the shop.. When I was back to set up an appt barber said its not busy to come down???? Will not be coming here very bad customer service!! While sitting in my car in front of shop 2 soldiers walked in and walked back out! Bad service here !!!
0,Wait time here is ridiculous. I even had an appointment. If this place wasn't so close to my house I would never come here. The only good thing I have to say about this place is that when I called this morning they did have a late appointment available but I think that's because everyone who comes here ends up not returning. They must have a high customer turn over rate.
0,"Horrible experience!\n\nIf you are depressed, please Do NOT got to Harmony! ( Ironic name..eye roll)\n\nThe first session is indeed a questionnaire so, no therapy there. Then after a 3 week wait for an appt with an intern/counselor, showing up and waiting for 30 mins they tell me she called in sick. Another 3 week wait, happened again ( at least they called this time) another 3 weeks go by and today..surprise,  I can no longer go to W Post Rd, where I live because the run-down Charleston office 45 mins away is \""wide open.\""  Unless, I pay cash to stay in my neighborhood of course, so still no therapy. \n\nWhat a nightmare! I am more depressed now, that before I tried to get therapy 3 MONTHS ago! \n\nI agree with another poster. This place is about greed only, and should be closed immediately, as they are causing, not preventing harm!"

0,"So when i first moved here all the punk/rock folks i met were like \""dude, you gott a check out the rogue. best dive bar around\"".  But apparently they hadnt been there in a while as now its an emo/dance dive with pretty snooty patrons.  Maybe I went on a bad night but was totally bummed as it has all the makings of an awesome dive. Its dark, the drinks are cheap, and theres room for great bands.  It was indy rock night or some BS when i went.  Not a pleasant experience.  I cannot stand dudes in girl's jeans."
0,"Poor McFadden's. They have honestly gone down hill. I came here for Happy Hour on a Friday night, and was severely disappointed. Their Irish nachos are the best, but... The service was so terrible I lack the words to express my disappointment. It took forever to have someone take our order, let alone bring us our drinks. We watched as the waitress asked another table if the food we had ordered was theirs. We Didn't receive an offer to refill our drinks, just plopped our food down and walked away. Next we ordered another appetizer. Once again the waiter wandered around the dining room, searching for our table. The poor guy had to go ask someone in the back, then proceeded to give our food to other guests. To top it all off, the worst of the worst. The waitress TOOK FOOD off of THE OTHER TABLE and put it in front of us. Really!? REALLY!?!?! Disgraceful, Let alone disgusting! I will never  give this place my money again. In the words of Doge, \""Such disappoint. Much anger. Wow.\"""
0,"Ok, let me start out by saying that the staff here is friendly, and if you get a decent seat, the views of the Flamingo Habitat are very nice.  However, the food at the buffet isn't good and the selection that they offer for a buffet could be a lot better (very small selection of items compared to all the other buffets I've been to in Vegas).  They don't even serve regular pancakes or french toast for Breakfast.  Waffles only.  Really??  If they offered more items I'd be willing to try it again and hopefully give it a better rating."
0,"As a collector I appreciated he was helpful in locating what we were looking for. He is however pushy and overbearing. \n\nNothing is priced which is always a bad sign. We were armed with smart phones and my knowledge as a record dealer myself. \n\nHe priced a record that sells for 12 shipped on eBay at 40. A record that sells for 40 online in ex condition was quoted at 100 and the condition was vg. \n\nIn 1.5 hours 4 people wanted to buy items and zero people did.  I am not a cheapskate but I'm not an idiot either. I will pay fair market average,  but not double."
0,"Called this company to see if they cold come out and take a look at my unit.  They were recommended by the Air Conditioner manufacturer, on the manufacturers website.  when we bought our home, we recieved the manual, but not the install receipt.  So we were not sure if we were stil covered by warranty,  Therefore, i was trying to reach the manuacturer. The manufacturer website refers you to local dealers,  so I called Emmett Air.\nThe lady was excpetionally rude.  She was short, and frustrated and gave me the third degree.  i told her I thought I was bothering her, and she said \""actually you are, I;m very busy.\""  I asked her if they could come out, she said, \""Why?  why would you pay us $64 to come out and tell you it needs replacing?\""\nSeriously, it seems that simply by being an AC company in AZ, rude service can survive."
1,Everything here is good.  One of my favorite restaurants.  My favorite is one of two things just depends on how I feel that day and that would be the chicken lavosh shwarma or the chipotle chicken pizza.
0,I came here today only because my regular nail salon was super busy. \n\nI got a pedicure and an eyebrow wax. Both terrible. The girl ruined my eyebrow shape. And I could have done the pedicure myself. Nail was not cut or shaped whatsoever. \n\nSave your money. There's at least 3 other nail salon around this place.
0,"Apparently this place blows on Sundays, even when the 49ers and the Giants are playing a semi final game. Such a shame because as you can see from the photos I took, the TV layout is pretty rad. There is also a rooftop patio with its own bar and again, many TV's available to watch games.\n\nRockbar does not have a kitchen but they do have a very limited menu that patrons can order off of from the Philadelphia Sandwhich Company that will be delivered to your table. There is also a \""gourmet\"" hot dog stand directly in front of the enterance, that per the owner, offers all-beef hotdogs with 22 different toppings. Oh, also their drink specials blow at 6:45 on Sunday evening...$5 wells is what they have to offer. The service was great, but there were only four other patrons in the bar for the short stint we were there.\n\nI'm going to give this place another try on a different night and I'd also like to see it as a music venue, my update review can (hopefully) only go up. At least the owners have their friends/employees, with 0-2 reviews each, writing five star reviews...good strategy, play on playa ;)"
1,"Started the evening with a moonshine flight of strawberry, blueberry and the apple pie. Blueberry was decent strawberry was better but the in house made apple pie was the star of the three. It was sweet with just the right amount of burn on the way down. \n\nWe moved on to the Bacon board it was amazing. I really enjoyed the jalape\u00f1o and applewood bacon. My wife enjoyed the con fit and we both felt the pork belly was the best thing in the board. The sweet onion spread was excellent as well as the house made pickles. \n\nWe then shared the BBQ sampler each of the meats on the sampler were very good but the pulled pork was the shining star by far. The BBQ sauce was thick and sweet. \n\nAs it was our 22nd anniversary they gave us a sample of the chocolate cake and the cherry pie milkshake. Both are awesome. \n\nThe waitstaff was extremely attentive and friendly. Bootleggers will definitely become a staple for our dining dollars."
1,"This restaurant today made my day. This was by far the best bone in ribeye I have had in Many years! Our Server Brandon Hanks has a lot to do with it as well as the Chef. I ordered as always rare Pitsburgh style no butter and wait for the veredict! Today, just perfect! Brandon should have gone back to his team and order just as I did... And voila, an incredible piece of meat.... Perfect amount of fat and cooked to perfection. Could get all the flavors in the meat and the charcoal... Also great texture.... I did not even have to put pepper as I usually do... Congrats!!! Finally!!! Ah, forgot, the place is clean, wine and water glasses very clean, bread average.. And our Ladera (wine) Tonight was very nice and smooth for this great ribeye... So 5 starts for them..."
1,"We have been looking for a good sit down Mexican place in the area and saw El Burrito from the road. We decided to try it out after reading some Yelp reviews, and I am glad we did. We have been twice so far, and the food has been great. The chips and salsa are delicious, the salsa in particular has a nice little kick and a deep tomatoey flavor - though it should be noted that they are not complimentary.\n\nI also really enjoyed how they offer small tasting dishes, the first time we received mini tacos and the second time a soup. Great idea to open up people to the other options on the menu.\n\nMy wife ordered the Mexican tacos with ground beef (with cilantro and onions) and loved them, and I got the quesadilla norteno, which was very well made. Others in our party ordered tacos with chorizo, which they said was the best they've had, so I'll have to try it next time we're there."
1,"This is one of my absolutely favorite places to eat. Here is my guide to having a 5 star experience at this restaurant. \n\n1. Make reservations a few weeks in advance to be sure to get the time slot you are interested it. They fill up fast.\n\n2. Go for an occasion, not a holiday. Go because its your birthday, or you are celebrating a big business deal. Not on Valentines Day. This is not me saying it would be bad on Valentine's Day, but most people get frustrated when its busy at places like this and don't realize that, well, yeah...its VALENTINE'S DAY. (If you can set the right expectations then HECK YEAH go on Valentine's Day)\n\n3. DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT take your kids here. It is not that the staff wouldn't be amazing to your kids, it is the fact that most people are here for a quiet night out, not a screaming 2 year old. (I leave my screaming 2 year old at home.) Here's the catch, if your kid is old enough to enjoy a good meal and experience and you would like some one on one time with them to perhaps congratulate them on good grades etc, this may not be a bad idea. Again...screaming 2 year old = NO.\n\n4. Finding deals for this place is also a good tip. Sometimes you will see coupons in your local mailer, or you can sign up for their newsletter. If not prepare yourself for a high bill. Same as when you go to Fogo de Chao. You know you are going to a nice place, you also know you are paying for it. Go in with a good mindset and be expecting it and it wont shock you, either that or drink some of their fabulous cocktails and then you wont care!\n\n5. Booths with privacy curtains. Don't ask. However be aware that they do have them and they can be fun. (Assuming here, I have never sat in one).\n\n6. Last but not least and most important. I do not care if you are on a diet, or diabetic, or hate chocolate (what kind of nut are you). Make time, don't eat for a week, take insulin, and have the chocolate fondue. This is absolutely amazing and worth the trip every time!\n\nFollow my 6 steps and you will have a great time at The Melting Pot!"
1,"Cookie Monster coined a term that would accurately describe my feelings about my lunch here - Nomnomnomnom! I had the prime rib French dip with mixed fries. VERY tasty! The prime was just that - prime. The side of horseradish cream was not crazy spicy, just enough to add a nice little zing to the sandwich. And why haven't more restaurants thought of offering \""mixed fries\""? A nice little pile of crispy traditional fries, sweet potato fries, and an onion ring or two was a real treat. I only wish there had been more onion rings in the mix. The iced tea was some kind of flavored tea, maybe pomegranate or something, and was also very tasty. The service was superb - my glass was never empty (a BIGGIE to me) and the server was very friendly but not fake. I will definitely be back!"
1,Soooooo delicious. So glad I found this place. Hard to find a real sushi and Japanese grill. Yummmm
1,Loved this place. Service from Jane was awesome. Tried 8 or 9 rolls and all were great. The rock shrimp app was awesome!
0,"Never order a sandwich from a.place with \""Pizza\"" in the name. The beef in my sandwich was good, but the bread was soggy and gross. I ordered fries but got chips. After 20 minutes I'm STILL waiting for fries with no update from my server. It isn't even busy in here. Not too pleased.\n\n(EDIT) - Later on my sandwich was so soggy that the bread ripped in half and all the fillings fell out. Grr. No more Nello's for me~"
0,"I went here to exchange a part (oil drain plug) that I purchased from another location that did not fit my car at it should. It turned out the package contained the incorrect plug (from the manufacturer). When returning the part, the guy at the counter asked the supervisor what to do with the part I was returning.... He said 'Re-sell it. We have to for inventory'. So you're going to try to sell it to someone else knowing it is wrong??? That's horrible."
1,"5 stars for a fast food joint? Yes, Raising Cane's actually deserves 4 stars, but since they get involved with the community they are getting 5 stars from me! They support \""The Rebellion\"" which is the UNLV student section. Since I am alumni, how could I not support a business giving back to my Alma mater especially since Cane's is from the south with not particular connection to the university other than being located across the street. They also give free kids meals to crowd members who watched a mountain west basketball or football game, just as long as the rebels WON. Just make sure to save your ticket from the game.  When this location first opened I did not understand the hype and actually thought they were pricey. Gave Canes a second chance and now I love it.  The batter is not too thick like most chicken finger places and you could tell these are freshly made and not frozen. Just like everyone else I too like the Texas toast because its soft and buttery. Nice touch with crinkle cut fries and Cane's sauce, which is delish. I also like the community/university vibe of this place especially after a basketball game. They also give 10% discount, but they will ask for student ID."
1,"No BS just good steaks.  The only down is that their wine by the glass is pretty lacking... nothing really old world that worked.\n\nBUT, great service, classy feel, and provides some much need VALUE to the Vegas restaurant scene.  I would definitely go again."
0,"Bought a groupon to check this place out. Overall, not impressed whatsoever. Definitely will not be coming back. Was quite disappointed. \n\nPros\n- They actually serve seafood. Salmon and the shrimp was the best. Mahi Mahi was over cooked. \n\nCons\n- Portion size is too much. Like another reviewer said, it's all about quantity vs quality. If I'm going to end up paying $130+ for 2 person, I'd stick w Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao (it be cheaper and way better food)\n\n- Majority of the meat I had was too well done making it hard and chewy. BBQ pork wreaked of BO aftertaste. Thank goodness it came last cause I lost my appetite. I literally thought the smell was from the waiter but I was wrong lol\n\n- Floor is super slippery\n\n- Bar selection is not great (food and space wise). The layout and area is so small that you have people running into each other. Most places give you certain appetizers (bread, mashed potato and fried banana) but it was served buffet style. The fried banana was gross because it just like they breaded a regular banana vs using plantain. \n\n- Dessert was not great. Even the mint leaves were not fresh. \n\n- Service is lacking."
0,"Highlights: Pizza and Merlot delivered to 18th floor, hot and delicious. Nice towels and decent beds. Great view at sunset, sunrise. Good enough workout room (2nd Floor).

1,"Our group of 10 dined at Morels in August of 2014. We make a trip to Las Vegas every summer and typically eat at one fine dining restaurant a visit. I personally go to Las Vegas at least twice a year and try to average 1 - 2 fine dining meals a trip. Earlier this trip my fiancee and I ate at Barrymore and we both felt that the meal at Morels was significantly better.\n\nThe reasons our group enjoyed our meal at Morels:\nService: I was the last of the group to arrive, so I do not know how the host / hostess did with the initial greeting. I do know that our party was seated promptly and professionally. Our waiter (Jake, I think) did an excellent job of answering menu questions and making recommendations. We had one vegetarian in the group and the chef made her a special pasta dish that was not on the menu. The support staff, sommelier and management were all extremely friendly and attentive.\n\nFood: The food was OUTSTANDING. We had 2 meat and cheese plates to start things off and they set the tone for the rest of the evening. Our group ordered oysters in the half shell (they had 4 varieties that evening) and those of us that ate them enjoyed them. Morels offers a Caesar salad for 2 that is prepared tableside and it is delicious. 80% of the group ordered steak, breaking down to 6 filets and 1 porterhouse that was split by 2 folks. I was one of the guys enjoying the porterhouse and it was fantastic. All steaks were cooked to proper temperature. In terms of side dishes, I had tastes of the asparagus, mac n' cheese and french fries. I felt the mac n' cheese was very good and the other 2 sides were solid. The french fries are skinny cut, not thick steak fries. We also ordered a few desserts, my personal favorite were the doughnuts with jam. The overall quality of the food was excellent.\n\nAtmosphere: Our reservation was for 8pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant was not very crowded when we arrived, and the atmosphere was comfortable and enjoyable. There was one other large party at the restaurant when we were seated and their presence did not affect our service or enjoyment of the dining area. After our meal, we went out on the balcony, which overlooks The Strip, and enjoyed a few after dinner drinks. By the time we left, the dining room was significantly busier but not too loud. \n\nLike any good steak restaurant, your meal will not be inexpensive. The question is: Do you feel like you got your money's worth at the end of the evening? Our group's response to this question is an overwhelming \""YES!\"". I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant and plan on going back in October."
1,"Great buffet. Although it was a little on the salty side, I'll be going back there the first chance I get, which unfortunately won't be soon enough as I live in Oregon. Everything was so yummy, and all vegetarian, a surprise to my father who naively asked for lamb. He was very satisfied, nonetheless, in the end."
1,"Beautiful building and a real Phoenix treasure. I've been going to their gift shop for years, even when it was still located at Dunlap/I-17. Lots of gifts and memorabilia from Ireland as well as the various countries of the UK. The main owner/organizer is very nice and seems to have dedicated his life to bringing the Irish history of Arizona to the people.\nWent in today to have a gander at the tea selection and two older Irish gentleman were working. It was great to listen to some stories and some Irish language while looking around the shop. Only wish more people cared about this place so that it could grow a bit more."
1,"Good food, good drinks, reasonable prices. Definitely a great place to start the night!\n\nI highly recommend their gourmet burger and huge margarita! The Irish nachos are a must-try as well.\n\nThe waitress we had was super cool, too. She did a great job and it was really nice of her to let my wife keep the large margarita glass as a souvenir. We were humbled and very grateful for the gift.\n\nIf I ever go to Vegas again, this is definitely a place I'd go to again without question."
1,"In N Out Burger is consistently great as their menu is simple and they stick to the same formula for success. I have been visiting here more lately as it is close to my place of employment and my buddy Sergio loves it for lunch!\n\n\nThe Amazing and always Super happy staff is ALWAYS a nice encounter. The food speaks for itself, fresh burgers with ultra fresh toppings with a unique bun and sauce.\n\nThey have a nice selection of drinks as well, I really like their pink lemonade and iced tea. They also make great handmade milkshakes as well which are a nice treat with a burger and fries.\n\nI love their special sauce, I always ask for extra packets of it to dip my fries in if I don't order them animal style. I am not that crazy about the fries, sometimes they are so thin they are just too dry. If they would change their fry style I think that would be one of my dreams come true!\n\nMmmmm yummy good stuff! We will be back over and over again for a burger fix!"
1,"This place is awesome.  Great food, super friendly staff.  Really has a nice warm family feel.  Our daughter has so much fun.  Every time someone who worked here walked by, they would flirt and play with her and she loved the attention.   Awesome place for families to eat in a nice, warm atmosphere.  Highly recommend."
1,"I shopped around quite extensively to find a great engadgement ring. I found Brian at the perfect time. Not only did I get to pick from a large variety of high quality diamonds the ring was 100% custom and designed by me for that special touch. A custom ring may sound expensive too. It was cheaper than the big name places for a larger, clearer, and better cut diamond. You will not go wrong here."
1,"Hoo, boy..these are some good eats!\n\nWe stopped in for lunch to find a bustling crowd in a massive restaurant, though the attentive staff more than made up for the lunch rush.\n\nWe were seated quickly and had little trouble finding something on the seafood heavy, Cajun-inspired menu. Kicking off the meal was an order of the alligator bites: spiced, fried chunks of alligator with a zesty red sauce for dipping and a heap of crispy potato straws. The gator was cooked perfectly, neither mushy nor rubbery with a noticeable punch. Figuring it would be awhile before I saw alligator on a menu again, I went for the half po boy/gumbo lunch combo. The baguette was stuffed with fried alligator, lettuce, and pickles covered with tartar and cocktail sauces. Topped with a squeeze of lemon, it was hearty, delicious, and paired nicely with a cup of fiery andouille and seafood gumbo, packed with crab meat, sausage, shrimp, and that holy trinity of bell pepper, celery, and onions.\n\nWorth the trek from lower Phoenix (or the suburbs)."
0,"Sprawling tired resort with $30 a day resort fee and lots of tipping opportunities. The resort fee was supposed to be waived for those attending the event, and was with restrictions like we couldn't use the fitness center. Only stayed here because the conference was here. We told the front desk that we were there for the conference, and wanted to be with the other Realtors, and instead they put us in a Mountainside Villa that was a hike to get to the event."
1,WOW! Very good food!!!!! The wait staff was very friendly and quick!  I always love the sharing family style of chinese restaurants!  You must go here!!! AWESOME PLACE!!!!!  And the person who suggested the donuts!!! THANK YOU!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!!!
1,"I'm a Tar-Jay girl....always have been always will be. I've always been able to find everything that I need here....now I'm not sure if it's always the lowest prices, but its comparable to other places. Now that Target is offering a lot more food options, I find myself grocery shopping for certain items because it is cheaper than the supermarket, etc. They have cute kids clothes too! I've always liked buying things for my friend's baby showers or kid's birthday parties since they have a variety of toys, clothes and electronics. One stop shop at Tar-Jay! I do get suckered into the dollar aisles when you first walk in, but I have found some good items like Cheddar Fries?! Yum!!!!! Who can resist shopping at Target? I know I can't!"
1,"I have been here twice in the last week and loved it! The place is now called, The Burger Shack. On my first visit I had a hot dog covered in bacon, shredded cheese, guacamole, and mustard....it was perfect. \n\nNext visit I had their BBQ Bacon Burger...the burgers here are cooked on the grill, with real fire...amazing burger. \n\nThey are serving a small selection of breakfast items all day, hot dogs, burgers, and some sandwiches. The owners here are nice and friendly and go out of their way to give great customer service...and the place was VERY clean on both visits."
0,"No. No. No. And No. \n\nNot what I expected. Not thrilling, Not exciting, and NOT worth the price. (Whatever that may be because my tickets were compd)\n\nI must admit, the costumes were pretty dope! The theatre was awesome and clearly they have put in a ton of mulah into all that equipment used on stage but holy cow, this was a painfully boring show! \n\nThere were a couple scenes that had me but for the majority of the show I struggled staying awake. This was a very long play...with great sound effects and beautiful background projection scenes. However, the performances were boring and mediocre. That battle scene that was taken out due to the tragic accident appeared to have been the highlight of this show. This was replaced with cartoon montage...looked cool but must have been awesome seeing the real thing. \n\nI would never pay full price to see this, but if they offer discounted tickets, for sure worth snagging a couple."
0,"Came here based on convenience and hunger since we were staying at the Hilton. Coming here reminded me of when I used to go to Circus circus buffet as a kid, with all the cheesy decorations, and slow, I'm-in-no-hurry vibe. Prices were decent, though still between $10-$15. I split a blueberry pancake platter and an omelet. We weren't allowed to do any substitutions (eg. change the toast that came with our omelet to pancakes even when we were willing to pay an extra charge). Anyway, 2 dishes with more than enough food for 2 people. Came with some crispy hash browns on the side, and the omelets were pretty big. The pancakes came in 3's, along with PLENTY of butter and syrup. My friend's southwest salad looked pretty good, and big too. Our server was this older lady, and she was extremely friendly and liked to joke around with us. But she looked frail to the point that I wanted to help her carry the dishes over. She looked like a hard worker though. I'd say although the food and service were good, the place was pretty average. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it's good if you want a nice, quiet meal."
1,Went to desert wireless today. They repaired my cracked I phone in about 20 minutes. Great service. The employees are friendly and nice. (Mat)
0,"I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said.  Save yourself a lot of $$ and DO NOT go here unless you already purchased a Groupon.  In that case use the Groupon and then ask for a refund because the food is THAT BAD.  The food is also way over priced.  Lethal combo in my book.  The service was OK, but not great by any means."
1,"I walked in and first noticed the spacing and style of the place. I liked it. I ordered the honey vanilla latte-less sweet and iced. It was great! The hint of honey was just right and not too sweet. Unfortunately I didn't have the friendliest barista when my order was taken...but she perked up when she have me my order. Hopefully next time I go, the person who takes my order will be a little nicer and more inviting. And gonna try a pastry!"
0,"I hate to write anything negative, however my experience here was a BAD one. I went in and asked for a stacked a line cut but ended up leaving in tears with gaps in the hair on the back of my head. The guy who did my hair was very rough with me, constantly throwing my head around. I would not recommend this place if you want a very specific hair cut."
0,"Other then the milkshakes, there is nothing about Burger Bar that would make me want to go back.  Service was pathetic, we waited 15 mins just to get drinks and place our order. The food was nothing special. Aside from a variety of toppings to choose from, I've had better burgers from Five Guys. Even worse then the experience we had at lunch, my husband got sick and spent the remainder of the day and night running back and forth to the bathroom to rid himself of his lunch.\n\nSave your money and go elsewhere."
0,"I was pleased with the photos, and the photo editing that the clerk did when I purchased the photos in Mirage's Secret Garden gift shop. I found out later the clerk was a Cashman employee; he told me at the time of purchase that if I gave my email address, I would be sent digital photos. A week went by and nothing in my email. So I called the giftshop. An employee (most likely Cashman) told me to wait at least 2 weeks. So I wait and wait. I call the gift shop again. They give me the number of \""corporate.\"" To make a long story short, I thought I would be receiving photos in my email. Not even close. Here's what the real deal is: with your bar code from your gift shop/photo receipt, you use the Cashman website to purchase a choice of 2 products to make the photos yourself on line. $39 for 8 pics, or 20 for 1 pic. \n\nI feel like I was duped into thinking one thing, and roped into another. All the Cashman employees at the Secret Garden had to do was tell me the truth: They would not email me at all nor would they email me my pics. I would not be receiving free pics in an email. I would need to hang on to my receipt and use it to buy products from Cashman to edit my own pics online. \n\nAll I wanted was a copy of one of the pictures that I bought in the gift shop. Since at least 2 employees told me I would be receiving an email, and 1 told me I would be receiving pictures in an email, I can only think that these employees are poorly trained, or that Cashman uses underhanded tactics to sell their photos. What a blackeye for the Mirage's Secret Garden. I have spoken to the Mirage Secret Garden gift shop assistant manager about this. She assured me she would check it out. She puts the responsibility squarely on the Cashman employees who work in the Secret Garden. \n\nI am going to address this further with the Cashman corporate office. I expect to be hussled at various places on Las Vegas Boulevard by street performers and homeless vagrants, but not by Cashman employees at the Mirage. Boo. Hiss. Bad bad business practices."
0,"Hmmm let's see , we have a reservation a Guys and of course the husband wanders off. I stop and ask where he is heading the casino. I shrug like whatever I'll wander with the kiddos. Turn to walk away to get stopped by svete the rentacop. No kids in the casino!  Oh no I reply we are going to the restaurant . No you and the kids have to go outside.  I'm like ... Whaa?  The hotel is jammed packed with children walking the same areas no one is in the casino so why can't we go to the restaurant?  No children must wait outside. It's in the 30s and we are guests seriously? .  Husband runs back like no no I won't gamble, we'll just walk on. No children need to go outside. That's where I'm about done . I ask him if he realizes we are guests and it's freezing and since hubs is there he's is like oh no you can walk on. Seriously ?? I go to management and yep his name was Carlos Santana (total double take) he agrees it's cold and if the kids were able to move on it shouldn't be a problem. But outside is completely illogical especially when it's cold. Regardless this place has left a bad taste in my mouth. The amount of people complaining before me should have given me a clue at the quality of service.  Staying at the Cosmo"
1,"This adorable bakery focuses on desserts on a stick like cookies, pies, whoopie pies, but primarily cake pops that bring on the goodness!  They had a pretty nice assortment of sweet treats to choose from when we went there.  Snickerdoodle, Chocolate Mint, Gingerbread, Egg Nog, and Banana were some of the unique cake flavors along with Vanilla, Red Velvet. I cant remember all what was in the display cases.  However I sure do know they have alcohol infused ones. Guinness and the Wine Moscato ones I tried when Dip Sticks was at Las Vegas Distillery during the Yelp Spectacular Spirit Spree.  That one was my favorite so I was happy to see they still had a few Moscato ones left on a late afternoon. They also have cupcakes but just a small selection and they had some cute cakes on display used for special orders. \n\nThe cake pops sweetness wasn't too overpowering at all. They were moist and the flavors were spot on both Moscato, Guinness and also the Chocolate Mint ones I tried.  The crisp outer candy coated like shells on all of them were real colorful and had swirly designs. It melted in your mouth when I took a bite.  I learned at their demo they are hand dipped and made from scratch..no store bought stuff here. The cakes are made from scratch as well.  Oh and they had some novelty ones on display ..cake pops inspired by Hello Kitty!!! They were super cute!! (they are special order only so call to inquire)\n \nLocation is in the shopping center by Barley Casino.  I came here after I had my plate lunch at Ross J's...The area looks real lonely right now, but come March the Galaxy Theater is moving in there! \n\nThe shop itself is pretty nice size, bright and airy feel.  Looks like they have an area set up to have parties.  Their signs and light fixtures are all their handiwork. It's  just so cute with charming touches of a sweet shop.  There are also gift boxes for your treats, aprons, cupcake gift items, handcrafted accessories (I got a very cute crocheted hat and scarf)  The lady who help us was friendly. I was told you can do special orders on cake pops, along with other baked goods and cakes they have displayed.  Check out their store it's all around delightful!"
0,This place is gone but it was a decent rest stop before getting to Primm.  cheap penny arcade and slots that still paid with change not slips.  Not sure if there are plans to build a new Nevada Landing but it would be a good idea.
0,"not bad, but we had major issues.  If not for the good price and nice quality of the room, I would have given it one star.  LVH (formerly the Las Vegas Hilton) is definitely not a Hilton.  It was old, run-down in most parts, but the room we got was newly renovated and even comfortable when you first walk in.  But then later you find it has issues.  \n\nWe had an initial problem that we had our neighboring room smoking, and their smoke got into our room.  Terrible when you are trying to sleep at 2 am or 3 am and your room is full of smoke and noise.\n\nThe other big problem is that the walls are paper thin.  You can hear conversations and noise from all around.  I could hear kids crying outside, the couple in the room next to us arguing and crying, it was strange and uncomfortable.  And the pool looked totally dirty.  So many people, you can hardly find a place to sit around or even stand in the pool.  It's not relaxing at all, but seemed most people were not there for relaxing, more to party.\n\nNot a good hotel and I was very disappointed."
1,The beans were amazing.  Fast service and good food.  Go!
0,"I have never written a review on yelp before but I feel compelled because of the horrible customer service I have experienced there. I have been going to their pharmacy for a year and they have never filled my prescription correctly, not once! Then when I call to tell them I wasn't given the appropriate amount of medication they act rude or frustrated with me. I have only had good customer service once or twice out of the multiple times I have gone. I do not recommend this pharmacy, both for its service and its customer relations."
0,"I finally reached my last straw with this place. A few weekends ago there was a crowd there that the staff was obviously not happy about sitting at the bar (which is completely normal at ANY bar)! It was midnight.. that means dealing with drunk people. As a business, you are not always going to like your customers or want them to stay there all night, but punishing the customers there that were not apart of that group is downright wrong. Instead of kicking out the trouble makers, they decided to shut the entire bar down early. Sorry, that's just not how you operate a business. Good luck to them trying to run a bar like that."
0,"Got a snack to go here. The smoothie was just ok and WAY overpriced, even for Vegas. They forgot my pretzel and banana, I didn't get them until I asked 15 minutes later. Barely got an apology. Not a big fan."
1,"I'm a little biased since I used to work here.  Nonetheless, it's a great nursery.  It's got quality plants, quality service and quality gardening supplies.  The customer service is especially good and the care taken of the plants is outstanding.  The only drawback is the price, but with the quality of everything so good, what else do you expect?"
0,"I was super excited to give this place a try in lieu of Drybar and was disappointed.  My stylist was very nice, however, my hair was completely flat 3 hours later.  I told her I wanted volume and it was anything but.  I had to scramble to restyle myself.   Was hoping to find a gem and support local business, but I guess I will have to stick to my usual."
1,"this is the third time i've had permanent eyeliner done and by far this is the best. nelly is wonderful and my eyeliner is amazing. she's gentle and the line she created is perfect. she applies a topical anesthetic, allows that to take effect and then begins the process. don't let the thought of any discomfort put you off. nelly takes great care to be fast and the anesthetic takes care of the discomfort. it should last about 5 yrs - and if you're active, you can get up in the morning and have magnificent eyes by just waking up. no fussing with a pencil or brush and the best part it doesn't rub off when you swim, ski or do anything that makes you perspire. perfect eyes 24/7. you won't find anyone else better."

0,"This place is total Ice Palace......so it is a great place in the summer.  Really....if I lived closer, I would just sit here all day and order H2o.  I came here with a girlfriend only because she had a gift card.  It is kinda of cool you can watch hockey practice here. It is a total sports bar so the set up with TVs, I really liked.  I notice the booths had their own TVs...that is really a nice setup!  Anyhow, we had salads....not a specialty place for that kind of food......this place is all fries, onion rings and burgers.  Our salads were  bland but  for 9-10 bucks ....GET THE BURGERS!  We were out of our element but we had 50 bucks to spend!  What's a girl to do?"
0,"Do not bring your fine watch to this establishment.  I was selling a a real rolex, so buyer wanted to bring it here to get authenticated.  This jeweler said it was not a real rolex and buyer did not want to go to any other jeweler and I lost the sale.  Since then I have brought the watch to two pawn shops and another jeweler in Scottsdale and each have said the watch is authentic and that rolex is the easiest to determine.  If this jeweler does not know a real rolex they have no business claiming they are an experienced jeweler!"
0,"I was very disappointed this last time around.the first time I went it was heavenly from the food to the service everything was top notch, so much so I insisted this time it was one of first stops in Vegas. I was dissapointed from the service to the prime rib, when we pointed out it was too dry to eat she asked if we wanted a Togo bag. We never got a replacement napkin that she had initially dropped .. It never got better.  So sad"

1,"I don't know why I keep forgetting this little place is so close to my house. Probably because I don't buy much bread, and probably because I have to go slightly out of my way to go there. Anyway... when a situation calls for a special loaf of bread, that is the one place I always DO think of.  \n\nThey make some really great breads (and brownies and cookies, too, I hear, though I haven't tried).\n\nLast night, on my way home from the gym, I stopped by to pick up something for today's team event. I walked up to the door, and noticed they close at 6. It was 6:05. The lights were off at the front and chairs were up on tables. Darn... So I turned around and started to walk away. \n\nOne of the employees opened the door and asked me if I wanted to come in, even though they were closed - sweet! Well, they didn't take ATM cards, so I had to go get some money. No problem, he said, \""We'll be here for a while, just come on back when you are ready...\"" That was great. Honestly... They saved me from driving another 3 miles out of my way to Trader Joe's or Wildflower.\n\nWhen I got back, I asked them what they had that wouldn't go bad between last night and this morning, and that I was looking for something  breakfast-y. Imagine that, they had a loaf called \""Breakfast Blast\"" (ingredients: Fresh Ground 100% Whole Wheat, water, honey, dates, cinnamon chips, rolled oats, yeast, salt, cinnamon). Winner. I chose that.\n\nAs one employee rang me up, the other asked if I'd like her to hand-slice the loaf for me, as this one with bits of fruit wouldn't do well in the automatic slicer. Sure! That was super nice of them.\n\nWhen I brought out the loaf this morning and tried it, it was delicious! Too bad we didn't have a toaster out at Tempe Town Lake! I bet it tastes even better warm and toasty!\n\nIn the past, I've picked up High Five Fiber, Honey Whole Wheat, 9 Grain, and Rosemary Garlic. I've also tasted their Trek Energy Bars and Becky's Coconut Bread - both pretty damn good, as well. I have to say I've never been disappointed.\n\nThey also sell breakfast panninis and various sandwiches and I think they even cater (platters)... Never tried any sandwiches though. So my four stars are for their breads and their service.  The loaves are kinda pricey - my Breakfast Blast loaf yesterday was $6.50 for example. But you have to realize you're not buying a mass-produced generic loaf of bread. They're well worth it, in my opinion.\n\nThe store also has some great little gifts, some kitschy and some really useful - from baking mixes to dishes, plates, and utensils... much of it made locally. \n\nIf you're still not sure about stopping by, just do it. Go a little hungry because they're pretty generous with their SAMPLES! Now do I have your attention? Go. You'll like it."
0,"Ummm...WHAT is going on?! \n\n-Now they're closed on Sundays.\n-Smoothie menu has gotten cut in half. Popular smoothies like \""Coco Cat Cow\"" is no longer on the menu. (look at my recent pic I posted of the menu.)\n-Drinks are split into two separate prices now. $8.00-$9.00 depending on what is in that smoothie. When I first joined Vegas Hot! about a year ago...smoothies were only like....$7.00.\n-No more $1.00 off discounts if you took a class or \""checked in\"" to social media.\n\n\nHaven't been stopping here after my classes for about a month now. And I don't plan to anytime soon until they change this ridiculousness!"
1,"Best place in the Valley to sit by a fire.\n\nI have only lived here for a little less than 2 years. Yet, I am one of those people who hasn't stopped mourning the old El Chorro. It was as if your grandmother died and grandpa remarried too quickly. The new incarnation is a lovely lady, but I'm still missing the old gal.\n\nWhat could win me over? For starters, bring the piano back to the (school room?) bar, along with the old piano players, at happy hour. Walking into happy hour at El Chorro was how I found instant friends when I first moved here. Yes, many were a couple decades older than most of my friends, but I learned so much and had such a great time singing along! And almost every time I went I met someone with a connection to Hollywood or an old rock band... it was amazing. What would it hurt to add it back, at least on certain weekdays?\n\nOK, enough. Now about the present: It is beautiful. It is well done. It is pricey. I have visited several times since the opening 8 months ago, and the food and service have both improved exponentially. For happy hour, you must try the chicken livers if you like chicken livers. Best ever. (Better than the old El Chorro's attempts.) Everything we've had at HH was superb; it wasn't that way 6 months ago, so if you tried it once, it's worth another shot. The special bloody mary is high-dollar but worth every penny. The pinot grigio is a nice value.\n\nDinner is fun and also much improved. My favorite so far is to have the fried lobster (yes, I said fried lobster) appetizer and add a salad.\n\nBe sure to spend some time by a fire; it's easy to do with all the options. Play some bocce ball. In hot weather, their mister system is the most effective in town. I think you could actually sit out there on the hottest night of the year.\n\nThe music isn't what it used to be. I wish they'd break down and go with nostalgia. It fits the place, the legacy, the setting and the regulars. After all, you go to El Chorro to experience Paradise Valley. There's no need to imitate Tempe or North Scottsdale. \n\nWriting this review has been cathartic for me. It makes me realize I am ready to embrace the new El Chorro. It was still hard to go 4 stars, but on its own merits, it deserves that rating. Add back the best of the old, and it will be 5 stars for sure."
0,i was very disappointed i ordered a half slab of ribs to go just to see what they tasted like because  i have never been to dickeys before. well the good things first . the people that worked there were very nice; thats about it. the ribs were dry hardly any bbq sauce on them even though i asked for extra sauce. no bbq flavor at all . they tasted like they were cooked in an oven . i paid $14 for a half slab of ribs what a joke.

0,"You've been to one, you've been to them all.  Which is why I probably don't visit Denny's more than once every 4-5 years.  On this occasion, my family and I were on vacation and headed toward Sedona, AZ, so we decided to stop at this Denny's for breakfast.  I had a waffle with some bacon, my wife got some oatmeal with some fruit, and our daughter had the requisite pancakes.  Overall, the food was okay-to-subpar.  My waffle was rather dense.  The bacon was the typical miniscule and fatty variety.  The pancakes were huge and tasted okay.  The price and the service were both just okay.  Overall, I was not swayed in any way to return to this Denny's or any other for at least another 4-5 years."
0,The food is ehh but I eat it when I waiting for my parents semi good food better than the caf. Food in my skyline college cafeteria good semi good quality.
1,"This place turned out to be a lovely surprise. After 10pm i believe it turns a 21 and over only restaurant which is kind of nice. We stopped in during a weekday and there was good music and the lights were dimmed and people were just hanging out eating and drinking and having a good time. The menu is different during the later hours but still a lot of very good choices. They have a white cheddar burger and it was probably one of the best I have ever had. It was just delicious ( I had one again a few days later..shhhhhh, our secret) and also tried their chipotle mac and cheese and it was fattening and yummy as could be. they have a pretty decent beer selection although not as crafty as some other places like Hungry Monk or Topps but still a good craft selection. Its huge inside and outside and more than enough room and space to get a good table or seat at the bar. Highly suggest checking it out, very good addition to Tempe.\n\nside note: they let me add a fried egg to my burger- which immediately chalked up their awesomeness- yes awesomeness."
1,"Fffffrrrreeeezing in winter, I'll accept, but I still like Ratho. A lot. Giant walls for climbing, shopping, bouldering, gym and massage, all in one space. I like it. \n\nEven more so since we signed up for the combined climbing and fitness card - so we can climb as much as we want, and also used the jaw droppingly impressive gym (Judo team use the same gym, so it is pretty impressive). \n\nEven better, as part of Edinburgh Leisure, we can also use other gyms/pools (including the Commonwealth... at an additional cost)/golf courses in the area for free. Given the 'lets go to the gym' feeling hits at random, it also means we can use the gyms closest to work, or home, without having to always pack in the distance. \n\nI'll be toning up in no time! Well, ok... at least it's the thought that counts..."
0,Everything was amazing except I ordered a steak medium rare and they served it medium well. The cold hard truth is if you are a steak house and you can't properly cook a steak then you just don't make the cut.  Lots of great steakhouses out there.
0,"I'm writing this bad review on principle.\n\nWe were in the area for DW Bistro and decided to spend our 30-minute wait at Starbucks. I ordered some sort of passion iced tea and then stood aside as I patiently waited. A couple who ordered after me seemed to be good friends with the barista and they got both of their drinks ahead of me. OK not a big deal. But then another customer also received his drink before mine showed up. At that point, I decided to get closer to the counter. Finally, the barista puts down some sort of iced drink in front of me. I didn't catch the name, but it looked like it could be mine, so I grabbed it and took a few sips. At that point, the barista asks the next customer if he was waiting for a drink. It turns out that I had grabbed his. I put it back down and tell her I've been waiting for my drink for a while. She then promptly hands me my iced tea. Where was that 5-10 minutes ago?\n\nI apologize for the long journey with no payoff. I'm not sure why my drink took so long, but they didn't seem to care and offered no apologies. Similarly, I felt no remorse about taking someone else's drink and forcing them to make him another.\n\nI also feel no remorse for giving this Starbucks a one-star review."
1,"I'm not really sure why I love this place as much as I do.  I like to go there and do reading, but I wouldn't classify myself as a regular.  Their brownie is great when you're feeling a little low (Am I an emotional eater?  Yes, Yes I am.)   I think I love it because it suits my philosophy on Phoenix and the metro area.   I will share this with you now:  Finding cool places here is like going on a treasure hunt through strip malls.  You can't expect (as I did when I first moved here) to just go and find awesomeness somewhere.  You have to seek it out.  It might be, as The Gold Bar is, facing away from the road.  It might be right next to a Baby Store and there might be a Starbucks just across the way.  I've done some classic eaves dropping and great people watching from their place."
1,"Despite being taped to the 7-11 next door, border between the two easily blurred and at first sight can make one cringe, it's pretty solid.  Staff was friendly enough at 7 in the morning.  TV on full blast in competition with Spanish radio station was interesting-- suppose it gets people in and out.  Salsa bar was shot to hell and in need of makeover--scared to touch it.  Mixed breakfast burrito was tasty."
0,"Mediocre food and service. I probably would have given three or four stars, but the coed restroom (complete with pushy attendant) kills the experience for me."
0,"Imagine you were a kid and thought you were going to Disneyland but instead found yourself in one of those seedy traveling carnivals. I guess what I'm saying is if you think your going to see lots of cool stuff for sale, see Rick, Big Hoss, Chumlee or the Old man you will likely be very, very disappointed. The shop is SMALL and unimpressive. They are hawking a bunch of cheap trinkets in the back of the store in case the casinos haven't taken your last dime. I'm glad I didn't wait in line to see this place. I expected much more out of Rick and Big Hoss. Now I think of them as Sick and Big Loss. Keep your visions from the show in your head that this place is big and full of neat stuff and that the stars are down to earth and accessible. You may regret seeing this place and realizing all the guys hide behind walls from the fans."
0,"Just ate there for lunch today and it was... decent. The Cod was pretty good, but the fries were awful. I had better Fish & Chips at TGI Friday's last week. Truth."
1,"We dined at Montery Bay Fish Grotto while as a treat for our freshman daughter who attends Pitt. My college student felt very pampered by the elegant atmosphere and the fabulous view, The food was impressive- we especially enjoyed the appetizers- the ahi tempura and the crabcakes were both standouts. The fresh fish choices were a bit overwhelming- too many choices! The salmon strawbery style came recommended by our server and was very good for an unexpected combination. We also tried the orange basil halibut which was very tasty (though my husband swore the fish was cod); the swordfish oscar was amazing; and the grouper monterey style with black olives and artichokes pleased my husband very much. Also enjoyed a side of lobster mac n cheese. We don't usually get desserts but they were all so tempting and made for a sweet conclusion to the meal. The service was attentive and overall it was a memorable if somewhat overindulgent dining experience!\n\nDefinitely recommend for a special occasion!"
0,"Let me start by saying that the food here is fine...nothing wrong with it at all, other than it being not particularly notable. Why one star? Well, I've been here three times and every single time the service has been terrible. One visit I actually had to get up from my table and find a server (we'd been seated for about 15-20 minutes and no one had said boo). The other two times we sat in the bar and it was about ten minutes before anyone appeared. In my mind, at this price point, this is simply inexcusable. The bad service was so extreme that it dominates my complete memory and impressions of the restaurant and bar.  It's probably a fine place to go if you are traveling, staying in the hotel and don't know any better, but otherwise, central Phoenix has much better offerings!"
1,great fresh food! huge egg roll! i would recommend this place to anyone! i get the kung pow and sweet sour chicken both are great!
1,"These burgers taste like they're made with high end Big Mac patties! Not a lot of variety, and really nothing all that special, but what they do, they do well."
0,"Do you believe in Yin and Yang? The ancient Asian philosophy suggesting polar opposites are interrelated? \nIf you don't, then you best start believing in it if you're headed to Flo's.\n\nThe manifestation of Yin and Yang is clearly present...like 'in your face' present when you're here. You'll see it from the moment you're seated, but you need to be observant...in tune...at one with the universe.\nLook around.\nNotice anything?\n\nLike the couple who was seated five minutes after you were. See how they're now eating something and enjoying their experience?\nAnd what's the opposite manifestation? Your Yin to their Yang?\nYou guessed it. \nYou're boiling mad, no beverage, food or server anywhere on the horizon.\n\nBut don't be mad. Look for the zen in all of this.\nTry to think in terms of the great Yin and Yang. \nCalm yourself by reasoning how you and your date actually sacrificed your good time  in order for another couple to be laughing, joking, eating, and now, sipping cocktails as part of their good time.\nThis is the great balance in life.\n\nNow you try.\nGo ahead..it's easy.  \n\nAfter dinner, when the bill comes, simply stiff the waiter on the tip.\nYou'll be happy you did, and now, the waiter will be pissed off...just like you were throughout the dining experience.\nYet another example of Yin and Yang.\nBeautiful, isn't it?\nAre you seeing the zen in all of this yet?\n\nOh, and one more thing.\nDespite your poor service, you'll find the food is really quite delightful.\n\nFlo's really does provide the full Asian experience.\nTruly, the manifestation of Yin and Yang.\n\nKudos Flo!"
0,The market is perhaps okay.  It is however very tiny.  I was not that impressed.  Did not buy anything as I did not see anything that I wanted.
1,"Our 40 person rehearsal dinner at Bonfyre was wonderful!  The staff was helpful, organized and positive from the minute we started planning with Jonny & Jamie.  The wait staff was professional and delivered drink orders throughout the night, meaning that our guests could mingle and never had to wait in line at the bar.\n\nThere was no need to fuss over details like centerpieces or name cards - this was included in the contracted price and was executed flawlessly.  The private dining room set the mood for our event - long wooden tables, low lighting and our slideshow playing on a large mounted flat screen in the background.\n\nThen there was the food!  We worked with Jonny & Jamie on a custom menu and communicated our guests' choices the week of our event.   Appetizers, main courses and desserts were all very tasty and the large portions ensured that no one left hungry.\n\nGreat value for the price, abundant parking, business casual atmosphere, highly recommended!"
0,Worst manicurist ever. Came here to pamper myself on my birthday. I told the woman on the phone that I wanted to make sure that I got a massage with my pedicure. She said that massage was included. I signed up the deluxe pedicure and had the unfortunate luck to get Jimmy.  Both people next to me had longer times in the chair and they were there before me. He rushed through the massage and did not seem to know what he was doing. These sage I did get was rough and my  back kept hitting the back not the chair. His nails needed cutting as they cut into the bottoms if my feet. I had to wait 15 even though I had an appointment and was out witching 1/2 hour. When I complained the reduced the price by $5. Big deal. What should have been a relaxing time was annoying. My advice is to find a different salon that cares for customer  service.
1,Tasted fresh. I ordered the ahi poke. Service was good and the fish tasted fresh. Little heavy on the soy. Not too much diversity in the rolls. Menu in japanese/english to cater to both cultures.
0,"Yeah...\n\nSo Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with this location. I was so excited for it also! I thought that it would be a great addition to the Town Square and was really hoping it could live up to the previous version of Gameworks that was on the Strip.. at least a little. In my opinion however, it does not. Not even close. Which, is understandable actually. The Las Vegas Strip Location was fantastic in many ways. If  the Town Square location could even be 1/4 of what the previous version was, it could be great. \n\nI agree that first and foremost, this place should be about the games. I also believe that they have really failed at the design of the space as far as the games go. There appear to be a lot of cool games though they are crammed into a corner. The layout is not cool. So clustered and uncomfortable to walk through when there are many players around. \n\nStaff was all awesome and very accommodating, I will say  that now.\n\nI walked around a bit and saw the space in the back, that appears to be for private events maybe? A few empty rooms with LCD TV's mounted on the walls. I don't know, but I'd rather see that filled with games and maybe some themed rooms. That's another thing.. the space is so stark and boring and as I mentioned previously, the layout is kinda whack. \n\nThe bar specifically, and even a restaurant that serves alcohol should not be something that kids walk through. It's not a difficult fix. There should be a divider wall between those areas. there are a couple of spaces that can be divided off for over and under 21 patrons. I understand that Gameworks will draw many under 21 people, but  as this is Las  Vegas and there is a huge market for the adult kids! As it stands, it's very uncomfortable to sit at the bar. Your back is to the walkway with kids going by, just not cool in my opinion. It even looks uncomfortable for the bartenders and servers to be serving there. \n\nI know that people reading this: employees, managers, owners and guests alike, will agree, disagree and be every range of emotion available at these reviews that are so negative. It's not easy opening a new place. Going in, everyone knew there were high expectations. \n\nI can't even go into much else without writing a full website on the subject, but I feel like this Gameworks needs a serious overhaul already. I really look forward to some major changes and hope that they come sooner than later. I will occasionally drop in to help support that.. but I cannot see myself spending money on games until those credits drop or you some form of unlimited play is offered as it has been in the past.. say $20 10pm-until close for adults, and something for the kids on weekends? \n\nI wish you luck Gameworks! You are responsible for a great many happy and fun memories in my earlier years! I want to be part of something great like that again!  \n\nHappy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!! :)"
1,"I am not a bookworm and reading is not my cup of tea but I am a frequent shopper at this location to pick up books for friends and family. I am very impressed with the selection of books they have to offer. The store is organized neatly with a wide variety of offerings in each subject, category or readers taste. There is a large children's section for the kiddo's. \n\nYou need video games. They got some. Yes, besides books they have some entertainment items.\n\nTeachers need to pick up some good reads for the class? They offer a discount to educators with proof of teaching that will save you 10% off your purchase. Be sure to inquire at the checkout. The staff is always friendly and helpful at this location which makes the shopping experience rewarding. \n\nHalf price is defiantly well suited for the book store. There prices are super reasonable for the quality of items they sell at the store."
1,I love this place! I eat there when ever I get the opportunity. Delicious and inexpensive. Can't get better than that!
1,"Best Tortilla I've had outside of spain, hands down. Definitely the most authentico spanish meal I've had since 2008 (when I was IN Spain!) and you all really have no idea how much this pleases me. \nMy parents are in town visiting, so this is where I decided to take them for their first scottish meal. Not very scottish, I know... But it was definitely a very good first impression of the Edinburgh food scene for them! We ordered a full spread of chorizo, tortilla, patatas bravas, the works! Everything was great, and the owner is a really lovely guy. \nBecause they are little plates, it's very easy to run your bill up quite a bit, so bear that in mind before you order the whole menu, like we did! \nI'll definitely be back again!"
0,"Worst experience ever! I purchased 2 dresses via the Facebook page in July and had them sent to me in Canada. After receiving my package I realized Heather from the purple skirt sent me the wrong dress. She then sent me the correct dress but in the wrong size. arggghh So frustrating! At this point, my canadian summer is over and I asked for a refund. Heather confirmed she received the dresses and had processed my refund. Well that was a month ago and still no refund. Now my emails and phone calls are being ignored. I am in the process of doing a dispute through Visa. I am headed to Arizona next week with 6 girls who LOVE to shop. I will avoid this store like the plague. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!"
1,Friendly front desk staff! Large clean and comfortable rooms! Less then $100 for a family of four. Many outlets for electronics which is great when you have two teenagers. Would stay again!
1,"Great show and worth the long walk to \""Hooter's\"". The band had the crowd worked up to a fever pitch with hit after hit. The Morris Day schtick, while high in energy, was a bit repetitive and made me almost wish there was simply an intermission instead, but once Prince was back all was good in the world. A wonderful group of musicians in their own right delivering spot-on renditions of your favorite hits. Definitely worth full price, but there are lots of 2-for-1 deals available. I found my tix at $35 for two!"
1,"Food was really good here. I like the atmosphere but was not a fan of some of the seating spots. One right next to the bathroom. YUK! Luckily a new table came up and we moved. The Mojitos were excellent. Scallops were good but almost too spicy. The tofu curry was awesome and the jerk pork and polenta was good. I wish had a little more depth though. But the okra was a good addition to it, maybe a few more would have been nice. Our waitress was good but seemed very stressed out or frustrated which was clear. \nOtherwise a good spot, very cozy and I think I will try it again."
1,"Very, VERY happy with the service at Neovision.  I have been going to them for a couple of years now for glasses and contacts.  (Yes, their designer frames are expensive, it's true. If you're looking for a bargain or a two for one deal, this probably isn't the place for you.)  \n\nI finally made the decision to get lasik done.  Dr. Gipson was straightforward with me as to what I could expect.  (In contrast to the other consultations which were nothing more than a sales pitch where I didn't feel my eye health was even considered at all.)  After the lasik procedure was completed, Dr. Gipson was attentive to my needs (and I'm a little bit high strung when it comes to my eyes.  I'm that person who goes on Web MD and convinces themselves they have every rare disease known to man).  He answered every one of my questions, and has given me great post-op care.  Very highly recommended."
0,"We were looking for a different chinese place but when we got there it wasn't open yet so we gave this one a try.\n\nThis is an older place, kind of a hole but I noticed that the staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. The waitstaff was friendly.  The food was ok, it wasn't exactly good but most of it was edible.  $7.25 for the buffet on the weekend but I think it's cheaper during the week, $6.25 or something like that was on the sign.\n\n2 drinks, 2 buffets came to $19 and some change.  \n\nI wouldn't really recommend this place, they didn't do anything \""wrong\"" but they don't do anything right either."
0,"Worst food ever. I had bought the groupon thankfully because I would have been even more angry if I paid full price. First off, we ordered combo #1, which came with the smallest amt of food & apps, there was edamame, daichon radish, kimchi, soup and a salad. Well as soon as we ordered the food immediately came out which told me all of this food was pre-made. We had a 6 piece sushi roll that was so salty you could tell it was made days earlier and kept in the fridge. The edamame wasn't even good, it was old looking. My bowl of rice was nasty, it had a layer of hardened rice that you could tell wasn't fresh.  Everything was so loaded with salt it was inedible. We ended up spending the rest of the groupon on 2 beers. Don't waste your time, go somewhere else."
0,This is the worst Japanese-American restaurant I have ever been to. Food is literally something my Japanese friends can make literally 10 times better. Food taste really bland and disgusting. Don't ever eat here because they over charge for meals here and the quality is terrible.
0,"Hello again Arizonians and visitors......\n\nI will remind you as alway I am the pickiest person I know and detest spending good money on bad food.\n\nI am going to review Salt Cellar while it is fresh on my mind.\n\nI was taken here today to celebrate my B-day and I LOVE seafood be it raw or cooked.\n\nWe sat at the bar, which mind you is a VERY VERY small area and very busy with servers coming and going with drink orders.\n\nThere were at least 2 bartenders that we saw and the first bartender to greet(?)us and I use that term lightly   was Dale. \n\nHe was quick to get our drink order and deliver it....so far so good... we ordered several items from the happy hour menu to include a couple of oysters on the 1/2 shell which was very tasty and a couple of oyster shooters...YUM and then on to some scallops, which unfortunately due to the very dim lighting we failed to notice were flash fried...(why anyone would want to fry a tender and tasteful morsel of fish is beyond me).\n\nThe scallops arrived and looked unappetizing to say the least and tasted equally as unappetizing.  \n\nThey were tasteless to the point if I didnt know what I was eating I would never in a zillion years guess it was a scallop.  My friend agreed that not only did they have a bit of a sour taste were just ...not good!\n\nThe last thing we ordered was escargot, this dish is for the folks who enjoy butter and ggarlic.....not my taste but I did try one and again.....tasteless other than the garlic    taste... I enjoy the taste of seafood and this dish did not do it for me.\n\nI must reccomend the bread, which is soft and extremely good and I was shocked that they actually charge you for bread when you are spending $50 in food but I will admit I was happy to pay for it.\n\nThe prices are not cheap but again, I do not mind spending money on good food....this was NOT it!\n\nNow on to the ambiance and service.\n\nWhen you enter the restaurant you have to walk down many stairs into restaurant which is underground....very kewl concept unfortunately the moment you walk in you feel like you are in a sauna....very hot and humid ...it overwhelms you....especially when the temps outside are 100 plus......HELLO....THIS IS ARIZONA....USE SOME AIR CONDITIONING!\n\nAs I mentioned earlier Dale was the first bardenter we saw and as efficient as he was I think he left his personality and smile at home...he did not make us feel welcome at all.\n \nOf course its possible there is some other reason he is unfriendly such as he was having a bad day, or he hated his job or......or......or...... nope...no or's.... a bartender should be friendly... I think its in the bardenter code or something.\n\nNow, I am not a drinker nor do I frequent bars.....but I did years ago and bartenders used to be friendly...isnt that how you make tips?  Even if you are busy?\n\nI had asked an employee his name and we were told he has been working there since 1986?  I am thinking its time for Mr personality to get another job.\n\nThis is my opinion of Salt Cellar and it is because of our experience that we will not be returning.\n\nI am sure there are wonderful items on the menu that are delicious but the service and food we did try turned us off.\n\nIt is my opinion if you want to spend a chunk of money on seafood try someplace else.... or not....its your call, but until you do.....\n\nBon Appetite'"
0,"Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down, this was the worst we've ever had. Cold, tough, congealed, and tasteless - that's the only way to describe it. I'll never order from here again. Quite frankly, the fact that I took time away from my kids to type this out should tell you how awful it was. My complaints fell on deaf ears. I guess they were shocked that someone thought that they were serving low grade dog food. I understand that sometimes restaurants crank out bad food. It happens. But when it does, you bend over backwards to make it right. Not at this place. I was told that he would have to speak with the owner in order to help me. I guess that's how they deflect complaints - blame it on the owners that aren't there and make the customer for away angry.  Too bad. Because we will be visiting a competitor in the future. This family of 7 won't be visiting China Sea ever again. Oh, and by the way, why can't I give this place zero stars?"
0,"Ive been coming to this walmart for over ten years already. And this is what I have to say.\nThe price is the only reason I keep coming here. The bathrooms are not well kept, some of the staff are rude, and there are people walking in the parking lot who shouldn't be there. Security doesn't matter. I have my keys in my hand when I'm rolling out with my things because single time someone's asking me if I want to buy something or if I have money. \nIf you really don't care about the atmosphere, then I would say, keep coming. However the things that can be a convenience may become inconvenience."
0,"Living in the southwest, this place is far out of the way.  With a groupon in hand and a day off to burn, I took off way up there.  The place seemed nice enough, so I walked in and waited 10 minutes to be greeted at the host(ess) stand.  I seriously considered making a reservation over the phone just to see if someone would walk towards the front of the place.\n\nWhen the waitress arrived out of breath, she seated me near the back next to the kitchen to wait again. 5 minutes later, I ordered a glass of wine.  She runs over and gets it from the bar and dumps it in my glass.  And I do mean dump... like it went up the side of my glass and over spilling on the table.  She didn't notice because she wasn't looking then ran off to the kitchen.  Ten minutes later, she took my order.  Twenty minutes later bread with a side of oil and vinegar came out.  Thirty minutes later, my caprese salad came out.  How on earth it takes 50 minutes to make a caprese salad I will never know. 25 minutes later, my soup came out.  I'm pretty sure this was pre-made and ladled into my bowl with again makes me wonder how on earth it took so long.\n\nAfter I finished the soup, I honestly wasn't full, but didn't want to wait 20-40 minutes for something that was actually cooked.\n\nI will give them an a star for the food being edible and an additional for having a decent cab franc by the glass.\n\nMinus a star for a careless customer service.  Minus a star for an insane wait times.  Minus a star for a stained white table cloth (eww).\n\nSomehow, I feel like 2 stars in generous."
1,"Love this place. \n\nThey have a bunch of great little kitchy gifts, sweet-arabilia (candies from \""yester years\""), some great wines, and a great deli counter.\n\nA few of my faves to leave w/, or find a table to enjoy at outside if I can, their hot pressed cubano and a coconut cupcake. De-e-a-licious.\n\nIts always crowded here, but if you wait out the line, youll see why."
1,Best sushi place.  Lots of great specials. Family owned. Always my first choice!  Family owned business that truly cares about giving great service.
1,"My kids and I really liked this place!  Went on a weekday and it wasn't crazy crowded.  We got there right when it opened so there were plenty of chairs, but even hours later there were still chairs available.  The wave pool was definitely the best part.  We rented rafts and spent hours riding the waves all the way in.  So fun!  Food wasn't overpriced either.  I bought some sort of Groupon like certificate so it only cost us $13 per person.  Probably wouldn't pay full price, but they have good deals on certain days of the week if you check their website.  We'll definitely go back!"
1,"Trader Joe's has a new loyal customer! \n\nEverything about this visit was outstanding. Customer service here was wonderful I was greeted when I walked in, given tons of great tips and options by the staff and thanked for my business! Now, that kind of treatment will keep me coming back! \n\nThere were tons of delicious options to chose but I was especially pleased with all the healthy snack options which come in handy when most of the day you are chained to a desk. \n\nAnd the wine selection was ahhhmazing!! I totally think wine should be it's own food group! I mean I left with four bottles that I'm looking forward to trying! What can I say...I'm a sucker for wine. \n\nYes, I concur, parking is a pain and hard to find and the parking lot is tight...but I'm going to just keep circling and hoping for a VIP spot in the front!"
0,"We've eaten here a few times over the years and never received a decent service, but the most recent was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nWe initially wanted to eat a Sushi A Go Go across the street but they were jammed without an open table at 4:00pm on a Sunday.  So we decided to settle for Stingray.  We walked in and the place was nearly empty.  The hostess was busy seating a family which was taking minutes for some reason so we decided to walk into the bar area.  We walked past the bartender and asked if we could take a seat at one of the tables.  He said sure no problem let me grab a server for you.  So we waited for five minutes with out any service while the bartender and 4 servers casually chatted behind the bar.  So we decided to take our money and our appetites elsewhere.  When we were walking out they didn't even care they just said \""Have a goodnight.\""  If I was management I would have fired someone on the spot."
0,"I had bought a Groupon ($19 for the $45 signature pedi). When I called to make my appointment they couldnt get me in for nearly 3 weeks! This was my first experience going to Kashmir but definately not my first time getting a \""Spa Pedicure\"".  Upon arriving the outside was not much to getting excited about.  However once inside it was super cute! The staff was very friendly as well.  The reason I have to give this only 1 star really has to do with the services. I was seated  immediately on a couch in the back and was offered my free adult beverage.  As I waited I looked around and noticed there weren't any Spa Pedi Massage chairs.  I didn't piece it all together until my nail girl brought over a bucket of water and set it in front of me.  One of the main reasons I personally have pedi's done is for the massage and clean up of my piggies.  I didn't feel that I recieved what was worth $45. All the girls there were super sweet and the salon decor is just adorable. I'm sad I can't rave about my experience and services. Also, I prefer the bubbling spa massage chairs vs. sitting on the edge of a couch with a  bucket of water.  I don't have plans to go back as it was not worth my time & money."
1,There are limited menu options but what you are offered should satisfy anyones cravings.  Food tastes fresh.  I was there for breakfast and I had the waffle and bacon.  I wish there was a turkey bacon/sausage option.  Expect to wait as this place was buzzing with people.  When we were seated the food came out quick enough.
0,"Before I departed to Japan for a month, I was given an impromptu send-off party at Monta.  This came following a year of nonstop coworkers cheering about how wonderful Monta was and how it made other establishments in Vegas, particular Anime Ramen, look bad.  So needless to say, my expectations were really high.  \n\nIt should be mentioned that Monta was incredibly authentic to the point where everything that I loved and hated about Japan was en-capsuled by this establishment:\n\nToo small to fit a decent crowd so there was a 45 minute wait late night on a Friday?  Check.\nHard benches?\nCheck.\nTiny waiting space?\nCheck.\nCompletely open mail slot in the middle of December with a door that didn't close so it was incredibly drafty and wet and miserable?  \nCheck.\n\nAt some point I was actually convinced that this was their plot: Make you so hungry and cold and put-out that you would just find the food euphoric when you finally arrived.\n\nNot to mention that they were OUT of miso so anything that had miso in it was not an option.  Seriously, my favorite thing on the menu?  You're out of it??\n\nSo finally managed to get to our food and the taste was great.  Broth was wonderful, noodles perfectly cooked.  Was it worth the wait?  Not reallyI just wanted to flee to Curry Zen whose attitude is blah but food is a staple for me.   \n\nI suppose that if I came a weekday afternoon and had a casual bowl I would had a different experience then it would have been fine.  But I shouldn't have to wait for a chance time to have a pleasant experience."
1,"Dear Madison,\n\nYes, you are eating sushi in Wisconsin. Lower your expectations, or catch your own tuna. For sushi of the midwest, this place is awesome.\n\nThe atmosphere is cool - thank you darkness! Great spot for a date. Sitting at the bar is lovely, sitting at the tables are lovely (although if you get weirded out by the traditional Madison table layout where all of the tables are *veryclosetogether* you might not love that)...and there is outdoor seating!\n\nYou will probably have to wait if you walk in on a Friday or Saturday, but you can leave your number."
0,"maricopa.gov\nFood Inspection report, Jan 2013 rcvd a \""C\"" rating.\nObserved accumulation of black organic slime mold in interior of ice machine in back kitchen area. \n\nI am totally grossed out!"
1,Excellent service. Very good mushroom Kobe burger & truffle fries. Drink not as strong as I would like but acceptable.  Tables were clean & chairs very comfortable. Have eaten at this location before & have never been disappointed.
0,I ordered a breakfast burrito and a latte TO GO.\n\nThe burrito was delivered in less than 5 minutes. After that I sat and waited an additional 10 minutes for the latte. There were 4 people waiting for coffee when I ordered. \n\nI get it that they take their coffee seriously here but 15 minutes for a latte when it's dead?? \n\nBurrito was ruined/inedible because the potatoes were basically raw.
1,"A little more home style compared to Roberto's and Fausto's. I had the Steak Special for their Grand Opening offering of $3.99... Great deal! Steak came whole as opposed to the Carne Asada plate version and half the price. \nOrdered two beef tacos and was pleased with not only flavor, but size as well. A little nice touch with the tacos was the mix of Mexican and Cheddar Cheese.\nI'm looking forward to trying their weekly specials in the future. If you like Roberto's and/or Fausto's give The lessor known Don Tortaco a try."
1,"The place is decorated nice and its clean! lol The food is really good! I love spicy food but don't usually find restaurant food that spicy. Smiling banana leaf is an exception!! My husband loves the pad thai on a level 10 spicy but I can only take level 8. The spicy green beans with chicken is my favorite dish (level 8). Yesterday, I tried it with pork and it was an epic fail! The pork was really chewy. I like my meat (except for bacon) very well done. The first time my husband and I ate there we actually dined in which was a big mistake! My friend told me it was intimate but she should have told me it was a crack in the wall (not a hole but a tiny crack). There was only one waitress/hostess for the WHOLE restaurant! Be prepared to be thirsty because it might take a while to get a refill. The seats are very uncomfortable! I felt like I was back in high school sitting on the bleachers with a numb butt. The waitress was nice but she didn't know BASIC restaurant etiquette. I asked for a straw and chopsticks and she gave me both of them unwrapped with her hands all over it! Gross! Keep in mind she is a waitress/hostess so she was touching money,the cash register, menus, and 5 millions other things... okay maybe I'm a bit of a germophob \n\n\nOH and how can I forget... the bathroom!! The whole time I was hoping and praying that no one would go to the bathroom and do number 2. The whole restaurant would smell it... yes, the place is that small. \n\nThings to take from this review: 1. The food is great! 2. ALWAYS get the food to-go."
1,"I normally would always give winco a 5 star review.....but... The pre packaged chub of ground beef tastes funny. I've tried it as a hamburger, taco meat, pasta sauce everything and no matter what u put it in, it tastes......off, also it tends to be mushy. So I'll continue to buy most produce and absolutely the coffee (I love their coffee) but meats (other than the frozen chicken and salmon) are out."
1,"My wife and I had a nice date here on 11/31/2013 for dinner.  We ordered the following:\n\nSMOKED VENISON\nCARPACCIO\n\nROASTED CAULIFLOWER\nSOUP\n\nBRICK OVEN BRAISED NEIGHBORHOOD LAMB\n\nThe food was very good.  It almost reminded me of Southern Farmhouse French style.  My wife especially liked the lamb (both my wife and I ordered lamb as the main dish).  \n\nThe venison carpaccio was very good.\n\nThe roasted cauliflower soup, was not exactly available on 11/31/2013.  Instead it was substituted with a seafood chowder.  Regardless, it was still good.  \n\nI would go back there again.  I do not know what I would order the next time though.  It is my hope that the restaurant periodically changes around the menu based upon what is seasonal and fresh."
1,"for your waxing needs... request for cassandra- she is amazing! painless, quick, and thorough."
0,"Yeah... well... it's just a bit MEH... Nice interior (lots of rustic timber and stone), good location (right on the Shore front, overlooking the boats) and a decent drink selection.  But the staff aren't all that friendly and the food, well, don't bother!  I work down at the Shore and wanted to like this place because it is so handy, but it just does not floating my boat! ;) I've eaten here 3 times (I gave them a few chances, hoping it would get better) but the quality of food was either cold/luke warm, cheap or poor quality.  The menu is uninspiring and standard pub grub, nothing to get excited about.  It's a shame, because if they improved the menu and standards, this place could be really buzzin'!  They have a small gig/function space upstairs (they even hold poll dancing classes up there), a mezzanine level for diners and cosy armchairs at the front. In the summer they open the full height windows onto the street, prefect for a sitting in the sun with an ice cool pint.  They often host live acoustic sets next to the fire place from Wednesdays-Fridays too.  So they are getting there! \n\nI last visited in November 2013, but in recent news, on the 21st December 2013 just before Christmas, a blaze ripped through their kitchen forcing customers and staff to be evacuated.  Luckily there were no casualties, but the fire spread to the roof and it took around 30 fire-fighters extinguish the blaze!  The kitchen is currently getting repaired and we are yet to hear when they will be re-opening for food, I do hope they improve the food quality at the same time!"
1,"First time trying Indian food, and I don't think it could have been at a better place. I got the Dhaba chicken curry, and I really enjoyed it! We also got the garlic and kashmiri naan, and both were delicious. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff were all very friendly. Definitely a great experience!"
0,"This place is seriously a poor example of how not to prepare, as well as serve Mexican food. I should have ran when I saw a hot dog on the menu, then got served small portions on a plastic plate. The food was simply horrible, and my date said her tacos (while chicken) tasted like fish. I had enchiladas, and they were the incorrect meat combinations I had ordered. Not only that but there was no flavor and it was also salty. I returned our overpriced dishes, paid for our beers and drove home-- only to get sick along with my date the following day! seriously!  I have doubts about the cleanliness of their kitchen. Is the cook washing his cutting boards properly? Mixing meats? ..... Won't be back in my lifetime. \n\nThe only redeeming thing about the experience was that our polite and courteous Waitress was well versed in the procedure of returning their sub par pseudo mexican dishes to the kitchen.\n\n** Note to the owner:   Even IF a meal was comped , I don't think Id be back. I appreciate the response, saying your kitchen is clean. Perhaps both my girlfriend and I just endured a rare occurrence ; but the food wasn't good either.  I think it's time for a new kitchen staff, and probably new guidelines on how to prepare or store meat.  Just my two cents ; because I never get sick from food - this was my first time in 10 + years. And if you get me sick, you can bet your bottom dollar I won't be back."
0,"Close to my house and convenient but I would rather drive out of my way to another place than go here again.\nI got the worst manicure I've ever had! Not only was the nail tech rude, it would appear I ruined his day because I am a stay at home mom with 2 little ones and a part time job. \nUpon sitting down, the tech asked me why I wasn't at work. When I went into my day as a mom and part time job as a nurse, he literally didn't care. His response was \""uh huh\"".  By the way, he had some pit funk going on and I had to bite my tongue to ask him why he didn't shower that day.\nHe started cutting my cuticles and boy, did he have some aggression he needed to get out! Ya think when someone's nails bleed and you have to wipe it off with a tissue, maybe you cut a little too deep? \nHis hand massage was awful. He did this thing where he pulled out each finger one by one so vigorously I thought he was going to yank my finger out of the socket.   \nI will never go there again. End of story."
1,"These guys make great pizza. \n\nThe first couple of times i got 2 slices of cheese pizza to go for under 5 bucks. I walked in, asked for two slices and was out the door in a matter of minutes.  \n\nFirst whole pizza I tried the queens white pizza, it was good--basically a ton of cheese and garlic, no sauce. its a heavy pie.  I liked the roasted garlic but I probably won't order this again.\n\nYesterday I had the Arthur Ave.  Eggplant, ricotta, and tomato sauce.  This was fantastic! The eggplant is breaded like with eggplant parmesan, which adds to the pizza's deliciousness.  \n\nI've only tried a few of the pies, but the arthur ave did it for me--i'm a fan!"
0,"... since las vegas is full of buffets, let me get to the point right away...\ndont go here !!\nwe were here for a friends wedding so we really didnt have a choice."
0,"This place is a joke!! The rides are very old and dirty, and look like they are about to fall apart. You get better quality from a traveling circus. We had a party here, and the manager Teresa, was very rude and  unaccommodating. The parties are overpriced for the service that you get. We will not be returning, and strongly suggest not having a birthday party there, unless you want a disappointed child."
1,"I LOVE Theresa. She's the best! She is always happy to meet any request I have for my nails. I like designs on all of them usually and she is always spot on in doing the design I want. Not to mention the quality of the actual acrylic nail is awesome, my nails never lift, chip or break, and I wear them fairly long. All of her nail art is pretty and she is never rude or rushed when doing my nails ( I have gotten that reaction many times at other salons when requesting nail art ) another thing I have gotten a lot of at other salons when I ask for certain things is \""oh no I can't do that because...\"" Theresa always does my nails however I want. I won't go to anyone else. Her pedicures are amazing too. Love this place."
0,"Ugh, stale chips mixed in w/ fresh chips. That's weak. My wife whose gluten intolerant, asked for corn tortillas since it's a taco place and the waitress said all they had was flour tortillas. I ordered the special which had green peppers in the tacos. Since I'm not a fan of green peppers I requested the special w/ out the peppers.  Five mins. later the waitress came back and said the \""chef\"" couldn't take the peppers off my tacos as the special was a \""pre-mix\"". Pre-mix?! It's a damn taco, not French bouillabaisse! Once I heard that I knew I'd never eat here again. The food was decent but I'm not going back again."
1,"Is there space for another coffee and sandwich shop in the bulging Edinburgh market? Cafe Milk appears to squeeze in quite nicely! we went here for a coffee and sandwich on a cold Sunday last weekend and were pleasantly surprised. The decor is very minimal, white glazed wall tiles and tables and benches give the place an austere post-war school feel, but it works well. The food was very nice - crisp, fresh wraps and hearty soups.\n\nI would have happily rated Milk a 5 star effort but for the smallish latte size and amount of space at the table.  On a busy day you're going to feel a little cramped. The guy who served us was cheerful without being OTT. All in all well worth a visit."
0,"I don't even know where to start. I ordered the house fried rice and was told it would be here \""soon\"", after waiting more than an hour I decide to go outside my office to see if maybe the delivery driver got lost. Sure enough, there he was stating \""here's your food\"", passing it to me, then promptly leaving. I looked down at the tiny box he had handed me and wondered what my $12 had actually gotten me. Not much. I had about 2 pieces of shrimp, a ton of egg and something that looked like pork (even though it's advertised to only include shrimp,  beef ribs, and chicken). It was tasteless, room temperature and really greasy. I tried adding soy sauce for flavor but that did not help. About halfway through my 3rd bite I began to feel sick and decided to save myself the trip to the emergency room--I threw this \""food\"" away. Will not be eating here again."
1,"Ok i walked in to this place while i was out there for a business trip and was in need of a cut bad i'm usually really picky about who cuts my hair (because its really thick and curly and can look really bad if cut wrong) but i had a big meeting at a casino and needed to look my best. So this women named Kat came up and asked me what i needed and how i liked my hair cut i gave her a general overview of what i liked and asked her to cut it how she would like it, well needless to say when she was done it looked great. There are people who learn to cut hair and then there are people who have natural talent to cut hair and kat was born to style hair thank you, you did an amazing job. I'll be see you for another trim next time im in town."
0,"TIP: DO NOT TRY TO GO IN EARLY. YOU WILL NOT GET FED ANY SUSHI IN A TIMELY MANER.\n\nThis review is purely based on service.\n\nSo I've eaten here a few times and the service is sub par. They don't get your drinks quick enough and getting the attention of our server can get tricky.\n\nNormally, I have dinner at Teharu. Today, I wanted to try something different for lunch. Like most people, lunch is a relativity short period of time. I wanted to grab something and get out. They open 11 am so a couple of buddies and I thought we come in right at 11.\n\nWe walked in the door at 10:57 and nothing was on the conveyor belt. This was a bad sign already. We should have headed into NYPD for a slice of pizza. They made us wait for about 5 minutes which was reasonable. We sat down. They actually got our drink order pretty quickly since we were the first ones to arrive.\n\nThe older lady came back with our drinks and by that time, we have been sitting for about 5 minutes. The only thing going around the conveyor was cream puffs, cheesecake, and soda. Knowing that I had a time crunch, I wanted to place my sushi order so that I can finish my lunch and be on my way. The older lady flat out said no. \""The sushi chefs are busy\"" and walked away. I was astounded. Seriously? If your hours of operations say 11 am, you should be ready to feed your customers at 11 am.\n\nShe came back after 5 minutes realizing what she had said. She asked 1 out of 3 people what they wanted. We order 4 plates of one roll. She came back with only 2!\n\nWe ended up staying 30 more minutes, attempting to get some sushi. The options at 11:30 were very limited. After sitting for 30 minutes, I didn't see a single crunch roll, Philly roll, California roll, or dragon roll and we were prohibited from making requests.\n\nOur meal was 19 dollars and some change for 3 people. THREE PEOPLE! We were ready to get our grub on and eat some sushi and the server basically said, no, you can't get your sushi right now because we are busy with opening the restaurant.\n\nThis was poor customer service. I requested our bill at 11:30 and it took another server 5 minutes to come back and count our plates.\n\nIn the end, I had maybe 3 plates of sushi. I was starving still and I took 15 minutes extra for lunch because I didn't want to walk out on Teharu Sushi. I was pretty forgiving but they simply wasted my lunch hour today. I now know to never go to Teharu during my lunch. There is a high chance I won't make it back in time and have my sushi!!!!! :("
1,"holy cow.  or fish.  We went to the Vintage for a work celebration lunch with about 12 people.  The service was good and we sat next to the fireplace.  The food was fantastic.  I had the fish sandwich and pub fries which was excellent.  The sandwich had 2 huge pieces of breaded fish and a toasted bun with a pitch-perfect sauce.  I took 1/2 the sandwich home as did 2 others.  The pub fries were as expected and delicious.  Others had the meatloaf which was good and grilled cheese did please.  I would go again, maybe have some beer this time."
1,"I really like this place. Clean with plenty of seating. Also has a nice outdoor seating area. I've had the veggie burger here, with a side salad, on multiple occasions and it really hits the spot. Tasty. Like the fancy water. I once had a salad here I didn't like, but I can't remember which one it was. Overall, a great place. I do have one suggestion- the whole take a number, seat yourself is nice but I noticed the staff having a hard time finding the right number to deliver the food. Perhaps there is a better way?"
0,"From the get go, I wasn't exactly impressed with this bar.\n\nIt looked promising enough as a place to start our night out but once inside, you realise they're playing Westlife songs and their staff are needlessly rude. \nAfter being asked for ID for the first time since moving to Edinburgh in September, the bar man who served me literally threw my change back into my hand.\nWhen another friend joined us with no ID, the bar maid said it was ok for him to stay just not to drink. She then obviously told her colleague, who came to tell us that he couldn't stay - to be honest I wasn't disappointed to leave here and move on!\n\nWe had a good night in a few other Edinburgh establishments and had no trouble with anyone else's staff..!"
1,"Excellent food for a vegan as well!\nMy husband and I went to She on our last night in Vegas. First week of December 2013. \nWe stayed at the Aria and they gave us a $100 gift card ( because my husband had a birthday that week) to spend at the Crystals shops or restaurants. We choose to go to She and were extremely pleasantly surprised!\nWe were seated right away when we arrived. 8:30pm reservation. Place was not very busy, but it didn't matter to us. I heard \""She\"" is getting bad reviews now because they no longer have the dancers that apparently drew the crowds. \nOut server was Andrew. Very knowledgable and attentive. Now, I am a vegan. My husband eats meat, so he ordered the special for that night - steak and lobster tail, and he had a peanut Butter dessert - he loved it!! Well, here is me telling Andrew I'm a vegan and asking him what could the chef alter and tweak off the menu to suit a vegan!! Let me tell you, my message was well delivered to the chefs and my meal was delicious. I ordered a mixed salad which was a good size, not tiny at all. I like to eat!! For my main course they made me steam vegetables accompanied by 5 different sauces, beautifully sliced avocado and amazingly tasty gnocchi!!! The gnocchis are to die for. The steamed vegetables came in a huge oval plate - a pretty big portion for one person. I didn't really eat desert since I ate all my veggies... :)\nThe icing in the cake was when chef Erick came to our table to have a chat!!! It was perfect because I got to thank him personally for catering to my \""vegan\"" needs!! I really appreciated it!\n\nAll in all, my husband and I really enjoyed our time there! You will, too!!"
0,"All banks conduct legalized fraud, but PNC does it under the radar.  This review has been a long time coming, but unfortunately, you won't care what I say until it happens to you. :)  Let's start with ATM's, you wanna use one?  Then you better use a PNC or an extra $2.50+ fee will be added on top of what ever the other ATM charges you.  That's right, lets say your in Tokyo (only 1 bank in the heart of Tokyo will accept your card anyway,  all others will fail ) and they say $5.00 fee (in Yen), well PNC will tag on their own $2.50+ just because they can.  What dicks you say? well let me also say another thing about international travel.  DON'T USE YOUR PNC CARD INTERNATIONALLY.  PNC uses Visa which they decided to set a 3% charge too.  So spend $100 PNC will take $3, ON EVERY PURCHASE.  My previous international travel bank Fidelity has since sold out, but before they only charged a 1% fee.  Before you laugh and giggle about pocket change then picture this.  International at that you can only pull out up to $200 from, sub-track 10% (3%+ ATM Fees) of that and realize that it goes directly into the pockets of your financial institution, of which your money is supposed to keep afloat while they rob you blind any which way they can.\n\nSheetz ATM surcharge free?  Think again, Sheetz won't charge you, but PNC will. ."
0,"Hubby booked this place after reading reviews on another site and seeing the price. \n\nWhen we pulled up and saw the facility we both said that this didn't look good. \n\nWe entered into the lobby and it looked contemporary and like like they were covering up something. \n\nThe front desk staff was slow! Nice but slow. The woman that checked us in told us our room was just above the lobby and to get to it we had to walk up the stairs. Huh??? \n\nWe looked at each other and said okay. \n\nWe pulled around to the back of the building to park the car and noticed that the doors to the rooms were outside. We already didn't want to stay another second but we dared to enter the room. \n\nWe walked in and saw the contemporary make over to the room which had a steel orange front and bathroom door. \n\nMy husband said that this place has to be a Motel 6 at one point in time. We spent one night and I could not sleep. we could hear people walking back and forth and talking all night. \n\nIt was so uncomfortable for me that I did not sleep and I booked another room @ midnight. \n\nWhen we checked out the staff was nice enough to give my husband a refund, which was the only positive. \n\nWe will NOT stay here again. I think we will definitely stick to staying at a resort or the Marriott when visiting Scottsdale. \n\nThis place feels as though the staff is trying to cover up something. I am not sure what but luckily I will not stay here again to try to figure it out."
1,"I was caught by surprise at how good the food was at Palmyra. I guess I wasn't expecting much since from the minute I walked in it was pretty empty.  There were many selections on the menu that I was not familiar with, but I decided to go with the Beef Kabob entree. I didn't want to take a huge risk by picking something I've never tried because I was super hungry. My friend chose the chicken shawarma. The wait for the food was reasonable. It wasn't ridiculously long nor fast food quick. When our entrees arrived I was impressed with the portions. My entree looked like a heaping mountain of delicious food. The beef kabob was juicy and seasoned perfectly. The rice was perfect. The salad had a nice light vinaigrette and the hummus was delicious too. I can see what people are saying about the pita which is rather thin, but it didn't really bother me. I was too happy with the entirety of the meal. This heaping pile of food was completely gone after fifteen minutes. I was so satisfied with my meal that I felt the need to tell the kitchen staff how awesome everything was. My friend enjoyed her meal as well, but she did make a comment that the chicken was a bit dry. On my next visit I am definitely ordering the Beef Kabob again. I will also say that the place was very immaculate. The bathroom was very clean too. I hope this place makes the same impression on others just as it has on me!"
1,"Awesome food, great atmosphere. Salsa bar is really good. Horchata is a must try. Very well priced. We will be back."
0,"I wanted to like this place, because it's close, but the sushi was just OK. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The server didn't know what Ponzu sauce was... That may have been our first clue. The sushi chef did, though, and dunking our sushi into ponzu made it better. \n\nThe fish could have been a bit fresher, the seaweed a bit less tough, and the rice a little more fluffy and sticky. \n\nThe edamame, however, was top-notch. Service was pretty attentive. I'd go back to try the hibachi, but the sushi didn't do it for me. The search will continue!"
1,"Ok, so i will be the first to admit that my drink order anywhere usually goes like this: server/bartender \""So, what can i get you to drink\"" , me \""What's cheap?\"", server/bartender \""blaaaadeblaadeblaaa\"", me \""then pbr it is!\"". I don't necessarily prefer it this way,  im almost broke most of the time. But now, now that Duckworth's is open right down the street from my house AND they have $3 draft nights on Mon and Wednesday I can get a reprieve from the peeebeeeers (i hate that word) and cheap booze. \nNow, I don't claim to know a lot about beer. I do know that i like Belgium Strong Ales. So started with a few samples (They are happy to let you sample any thing that is on draft) Decided on one of the 10%+ abv. dark ales- still only $3. Hell yes. Had a few of those throughout the evening and the table shared the hangover pizza for noms. Pizza was pretty tasty. Can anything with 3 types of bacon on it not be?  My only teeny tiny gripe is with the egg and its the same as when i had the steak and egg philly on my last visit. I dig eggs on burgers with runny yolks.  Instead, here the egg is scrambled and mixed in with everything. Not really what i was expecting. \nOverall, cool place. Service is good, food is decent and the beers are awesome. I highly recommend checking it out on a $3 draft night."
0,"Horrendous. First time for both my friend and I. We had high hopes, had heard good things even from my non-yelp friends. Wasn't expecting a mid west style diner, when we walked in, the first thing I noticed was a giant big screen tv hanging over the bar replaying CNN or Fox (I can't even remember what it was, as I can't stand watching either) and a couple old dudes hanging around watching it. We seat ourselves, and we are roughly \""greeted\"" by a woman and before I can finish my sentence of ordering coffee, she has already left our table. We noticed right away she was the only one serving the entire restaurant. So she comes back to finish our order, and before two words can get out of my mouth, she leaves to go answer the telephone. \n\nWe finally place our order, San Diego Omelet with a side of grits and Monte Cristo with Sweet Potato fries. They both come out, they look decent, but one bite into the Monte Cristo and I was done, it was disgusting. Inedible and I don't know how but my fries were sour. I never leave a fry untouched. Never. I couldn't eat them. The San Diego Omelet was nothing special. The only thing this place has going for them is they don't use instant grits."
0,Sundays used to be all you can drink vodka for 10 dollar cover... After paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are 2 dollars... Why would anyone come on Sunday if they're pouring 2 dollar glasses of cranberry juice?

1,"A decent little nail salon that I go to if the place I regularly attended is way too busy. The ladies (and the guy) are really nice and its never really busy  (at least when I go) and the only reason I don't go their more is because its just a little bit more expensive. Not by much, but I just have a great rapport at the other place as I have been going their longer.  If you are in the area, check out China Nails. They will definitely take good care of you."
0,Food isn't that good and the Biscuits and Gravey was the worst ever .Don't order the eggs Benedict either
0,"We came here because of the high yelp reviews. It was awful! We waited over an hour in line to be seated. felt like I was at an amusement park waiting for a rollercoaster ride. We came here for the Saturday seafood brunch. $30 a head. The seafood was totally fishy and the rest of the food was barely edible. Even not eating the seafood because of its fishiness, it was nauseating being surrounded by it. \nSure wine and beer is included. But it is crappy wine and beer."
0,Ok so I received a gift card for the Miracle Mile Shops which I had never been to before. I was quite excited because they have a Lush there and I love Lush and I go there all the time. \n\nOn my way through the mall I came across Basin and decided to check it out. It was pretty impressive. The scents were good and I decided to try it out.\n\nI spent about 45 minutes before deciding on the stuff I was going to try. I go to purchase and that was when I was advised they don't take the gift card for the Miracle Mile Shops. What? Is this not a shop at the Miracle Mile? \n\nI could have purchased the stuff I had chosen but decided not to at that point. \n\nNever even got to try the products. They could have had a permanent customer but I just continued to Lush instead and still got what I came for.
0,"It's trying to be a Vegas pub but not there yet.  I ordered a specific wine, they poured a different one?  Menu online doesn't match in restaurant.   45minutes after we ordered a cheese plate , salad , & burger as dinner, we were told the burger was dropped so another was being prepared.  ??  What about the cheese plate & salad?  Keep trying please."
0,I waited 2 hours while the front desk clerk was having insurance mix ups. There was only one nurse and one np there seeing patients. The pre exam room where they take your temp & blood pressure is tiny and gross. I will NOT be going there ever again. The only good thing was the np was great.
0,"Although decent for a breakfast place, they're falling behind the times.  Usually coming here with my dad,  it seems to be the go-to breakfast place that hasn't adapted their menu.  No meaningful gluten free options. Nor organic eggs.\n\nMost of their dishes are covered in cheese,  but all of them are from cows (the feta isn't even goat,  or sheep.... sorry lactose intolerant people!)\n\nIf you have any diet sensitivities or trying to eat clean,  give this place a pass. If they would come out of the dark ages with ingredients and quality,  this place would shoot up two or three more stars."
1,"This place was GREAT! The fellas were friendly, helpful, and fair with prices. I plan on taking my vehicles back here for any issues they have."
1,"COOKIE!!\n\nOkay, so I'm not the famous blue puppet, but get me near Dave & Andy's and I turn into the proverbial cookie monster faster than I'd like to admit. Their Cookie Dough ice cream is so packed with cookie dough that I've been tempted to bake it. \n\nJust in case that wasn't enough, though, they also offer waffle cones that are made in-house, with an M&M treat hidden in the bottom. If you're in oakland and need to cool down, you can't do better than Dave & Andy's for a great ice cream snack."
1,"Cantina is a great spot for Mexican food.  They have a fun atmosphere, some excellent guacamole, and overall delicious food.  I particularly enjoy the fish tacos."
1,Cool atmosphere with a great view!  Love the decor and the open air feel... reminds me of Seattle's Pike Place Market.  My favorite is the Chicken Pot Pie Bites and the Wrapped Dates... to die for!  Went yesterday and enjoyed special pricing for sangria and mimosas.  Love this place!
0,"Wow this place is humongous.  It's iconic.  You really can't miss the large green hotel and the large MGM Lion.  The location is on the corner with 3 other large and iconic casinos as well: Tropicana, Excalibur and NY NY.  And I don't like it.  It's sterile.  Big is not always better.  You have to walk miles just to get around here, and that's just inside.  A nice shopping complex is here, but doesn't compare to the Caesars Forum and the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes.  Your hotel room, all towers are a million miles from the casino.  It's a shorter walk to California than it is to your room.  The large lobby is impersonal and crowded always moving slowly.  The car valet is among the slowest in Vegas.  The casino rewards programs, linked to many great Vegas casinos doesn't seem to reward you.  It's just like their slot machines; they think your money.  The only nice walking distance casino is NY NY, so even if it seems there is a lot to do, there really isn't.  Stay mid strip where there is more action and more choices of gambling and activities."
1,"Like the 5 star rating says, \""as good as it gets.\"" As an internet startup, we are fortunate to have access to legal services from Kelly Warner that meet our standards for the cutting edge. We had a number of legal items that needed attention and its attorneys were able to address them quickly and professionally. Aaron Kelly called us and talked to us on Skype personally to make sure we were taken care of. Plus, he's a pleasant guy with a great sense of humor which is not common in this field.  If you have legal concerns . . . . call or email Aaron."
1,"I went to the Refuge yesterday after yoga for breakfast and coffee (sorry for my gross self coming in, haha) as part of my coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw!). The people working here were nice enough and the prices were pretty standard. I got a latte and a bacon/egg/cheese/potato breakfast burrito. The 4 star review is really for the latte alone, the latte was very good...the burrito, on the other hand, was not very good at all. It was very large, too big for just me. It had a lot of egg in it compared to other ingredients and didn't have much flavor (was supposed to be southwestern, not sure what made it southwestern at all). It was served with some terrible, flavorless salsa... just overall not impressive. I would come back for coffee, but not for food."
1,Best rooftop in midtown! Best speciality drinks! Best apps! Best full menu! Can't go wrong here. Loved to come to their Wednesday night flamenco night (not sure if they're still doing this).

0,"The hostess doesn't know how to seat people here.  I came here before when they were pretty busy and the only two seats available were at the bar but not together.  I thought, ok I'll just ask this nice looking person to slide down a seat so I could sit with my husband.  Apparently this is a huge no-no.  The hostess intervened and said that they can't ask anyone to move.  Whatever, we left.  So I came back today with a large group.  Tons of open tables but none together.  You would think since they don't take reservations they would seat their customers appropriately to prepare for a group of five or more (not too uncommon right?). They should really take reservations and seat their customers in a systematic way."
0,If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all. I got a fill and a fix because I broke a nail. First off they didn't cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long. Second off they are so thin I feel like they are just going to crack off.  Not to mention it seems very dirty.. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. One of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me. I will not be returning again.
1,"I'd seen Cirque du Soleil's productions before in Asia, but nothing prepared me for this. When I walked into the theater with lil guy, I was taken aback at the sheer size of this whole production. \n\nWe got pretty good seats -- eye level. I chose NOT to sit way up front due to previous experiences as I knew with any Cirque productions, you will have to stretch your neck up to view everything high up and miss a lot of things which were performed on an elevated stage. And I'm really glad I chose the seats I did because we got an excellent view.\n\nBefore the show started some cast members would interact with the audience which caused some hilarious moments. There was also one staged interaction which basically was a message to audience members not to smoke, use their cell or use flash photography during the performance. It was nicely executed.\n\nI'm not sure if I enjoyed KA as much as previous productions because I felt that the story line was really confusing (and it seems that other yelpers have found the same thing). Yes the acrobatic movements are quite impressive, but anyone who has seen the Chinese acrobats in action will know that this is really nothing exceptional. However, when you put that together with the music, the lights, the stage effects and the entire grandiose and elaborate production that KA is, I guess it's pretty damn amazing.\n\nI know hubby and lil guy (both Cirque du Soleil virgins) were both in awe of it all. Lil guy loved the pyro show at the end. His eyes were just wide open throughout the entire performance with intermittent glances over to me with a huge grin on his face. Just that alone was enough to bring him to another Cirque performance.\n\nOH and another thing.... you can buy drinks -- yes, alcoholic drinks -- and bring it into the theater and drink them while you watch the show."
0,"So I wasn't so excited about going to this place, it just didn't seem like my kind of place. Atlas, at the insistence of someone else, we went. And yuck. Well, while we were standing in line, there was a big menu-esque thing describing all the different stations they had, and it sort of got me excited. I planned on filling up on sushi and sea food. So we get in, and the buffet is literally about ten feet long, that's it. Each station consisted of one food item. Sure I was happy to see the big mound of shrimp and crab legs, but it ended up grossing me out instead. How long have they been sitting out, exactly? I don't know, but the shrimp still had the shell on them, and, it was a little fishy. Fishy seafood is a no-no.\n\nI didn't even enjoy the desert buffet. Although I had two dinner rolls, that's pretty much what I filled up on. But you can't really screw up dinner rolls, can you? (knock on wood)\n\nI don't plan on going back, or even recommend anyone else going there. \n\nBut I did see Donnie Osmond in person! Not that I had anything to say to the guy, I mean, exactly what is he famous for? Anyway, I would've hoped he'd have better taste in food than the buffet at Flamingo..."
0,"I really don't understand this McDonald's... This is the closest McDonald's to my house without having to get out of my car at Walmart... But let me tell you!! Probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to as far as customer service and overall service.. They're never on time, my fries are always weak and if I order a large they never give me a large serving.. Always a medium serving in a large container... Its safe to say I'll be using the Walmart McDonald's or take the extended drive to another location.."

0,"This is a pretty trash mini golf course and I have been to my fair share.  We went on a Saturday night in the middle of February...we are talking primo outdoor time in AZ...and they had one of their four courses closed.  Then, adding to the already frustrating congestion, they over-sell to groups.  Instead of sticking to their own posted rule of \""no more than 4 to a group\"" they will allow families of 8, 10, 23 to group up and play together.  This, as you can imagine, causes some serious congestion on the links.\nSo after waiting 10 minutes for the group ahead of us to finish the first hole, we decided to skip over them and just come back and finish that hold later.  Glad we did because we noticed a backup of 4 groups behind them as we neared the end.\nThe holes are decent but pretty unimaginative.  There really isn't much integration into the natural landscape which takes a bit of the fun out of it, plus there were multiple holes with the same \""trick\"" on one course.  That makes for a pretty boring go 'round.  There are no pars listed for each hole which takes some of the fun out of the game.\nThis is a pretty low-rent golf course and they charge about $7 per player.  I guess that is a decent price but there are better places to play in the Valley."
1,Took my two puppy-sons in for grooming for  their first visit here. The staff was gentle and kind. Toby and Rudy had a great day & received great haircuts. We're sold!
1,"I'm quite surprised at the low reviews recorded for this joint. It's actually a lot better than the measly 3.5 stars it has even though I rate it a half star more than the average.\n\nComing from LA where I know what's up with my Mexican fix, this place definitely serves Mexican food that can quite possibly resemble my beloved taco trucks in my hometown. The Asada can definitely be cut to smaller pieces, however everything else is as good as it gets. My personal favorite was the chorizo. I only got a single taco of chorizo and it was a mistake because I should have gotten maybe 10 more. They normally don't list the chorizo burrito outside the breakfast hours but if you ask, they will give to you. It's spicy and juicy. The pastor is cut from spits and served with the pineapples which gives the juiciness as well. The asada burrito was okay at best. Excess of rice and beans which takes away the taste of the asada. Nonetheless, I can easily eat 10 tacos. \n\nTacos are only $1.35 so take that Tacos El Gordo ($2.00 excluding taxes)!\n\nThis place is easily the best tacos in town."
1,"\""Natural cut\"" french fries are worth the visit - there's a heap of potatoes under the cutter and after you order then put one through the cutter and into the frier, and they come out piping hot and full of actual potato flavor.  So simple, I know, but so much better than just about any other place that serves french fries.\n\nSonoran root beer is available here, and you have to love a place that has a separate dedicated tap for root beer on draft.\n\nService was incredibly warm and friendly, and the atmosphere was upbeat and very, very clean.  \n\nGrilled cheese was fairly good, and the onion rings and fried 'shrooms are next on my \""to try\"" list for this place.  \n\nOnly minor complaint is that you're ordering a la carte and the portions could be bigger in this case.  Right now, order your dog or grilled cheese and it's pretty much \""add a fries and drink for $4\"" which you rarely see for just a small side of fries and drink that are paired with a main course lunch entree.  A combo would be nice, or if you're going to pay a la carte prices then I think it ought to be a larger portion."

0,"What a disappointing experience. Not feeling well and knowing my Primary Care Doctor's office had closed I decided to run to Urgent Care.  Unfortunately this was an upsetting experience. Upon arriving I was quoted 25 minutes. After 40 minutes I approached the bench and was told it was 25 minutes until I would be checked in...not what I was told. I wsa finally asked to Check In and asked how long it would be to get to see the doctor.  She said that would be another 25 minutes and to finally see the doctor could be another 45 minutes..Seriously? I decided to stick with them and finally made it back to see the doctor. The nurse was nice and when the doctor finally arrived she was nice as well and addressed my concerns very thoroughly.  Unfortunately my last ten minutes were the best, but overall what I nightmare."
0,"I've been meaning to try out Luc's ever since they started the remodel from the previous restaurant. I only live a few minutes away, so my close restaurant choices are pretty sparse. I finally went with my husband during happy hour. That is the only reason that I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 star. Their cocktails are very tasty and potent and they are half price at happy hour! \n\nThe food however was generally not good, especially for the prices they charged. We had the pork belly with avocado empanada and the Kona Kampachi served on a salt block. I've eaten a lot of fine dining over the years, so small portion sizes do not bother me as long as the food quality is there. Well, at Luc's the food quality is not good. The Kampachi tasted a bit like mackerel and the portion size was barely 3 small bites. That fish was definitely not fresh and for $14, it was tremendously overpriced. The pork belly was a bit better, but they could have cooked it differently in order to get the fat to a nice crisp instead of a mush that didn't quite melt in my mouth. The empanada dough was underdone and the avocado filling was barely present.   You can watch a couple of the cooks in the open kitchen. I got a look at the scallops they were plating. They were the size of a quarter and looked pretty well seared, probably indicating that they were overdone. The chef had a glazed look in his eyes and looked bored to tears for the whole time I was there. The front of the house, however, was extremely enthusiastic.\n\nSo my advice is to go during happy hour (5pm - 7pm daily, I believe), sit at the bar and just get drinks. The decor is fun to look at and the bartender we had was very attentive and made good cocktails."
1,"I saw LOVE yesterday, my first Las Vegas show.\n\nIt was mind-bogglingly fantastic. I was totally swept away and mesmerized for over two hours. The sheer creativity, imagination, music, engineering, intricate choreography left me in a state of deep admiration for the entire effort.\n\nIt was superb beyond words. See it before you die."
0,"I went in the other night on a calzone craving. I was a little disappointed to see how limited the menu was in that department and to top it off the restaurant wanted to nickle and dime me for every additional topping. By nickle and dime i mean $1 or $2, per topping, for small or large calzones, respectively. The most frustrating part was how small the large calzone was. It was maybe 7-8 inches in diameter, the dimensions of a small calzone at other Italian dives. \n\nThe upside is the interior has been completely redone. The comprehensive makeover they gave this place really made it nice for the tier of restaurant this place is in. \n\nI havent tried other items on the menu but im the kind of guy who typically orders a calzone so its unlikely I will choose to come back here. Sorry"
1,"Surprised, room layout and quality is great, two TVs, and even come with microwave. Great room for romance, you can see the shower and bath tube from the living room. I am sure they have room has enclosed bath room. The other features, one touch on/off for all the light, and even the phone (a little disapointment on the phone) is a touch screen, with alarm, weather, etc. Like other people said, don't expect reasonable price on anything."
1,"Wasn't expecting much, and was blown away. Spring rolls were great, veggie/mushroom pho was great, thai iced tea was great. Limited menu, but a big portion of good food (and free refills on the iced tea.)\n\nOne criticism is that the spring rolls are listed as vegetarian on the menu, but shrimp is not a, uhm, vegetable. If I had been a traditional vegetarian I would have been upset, since you can't really see exactly what you're eating inside the wrapper."

0,"I went to The Compound strictly to see a band play. I did not try any of the food, so I can only comment on this place as a music venue. \n\nThe Compound really needs to rethink the set up of this place. It's more of a resaurant and any band playing there almost gets resigned to background music. I don't like the set up of the tables. It's just not great for watching a band. You have the servers passing by every few minutes to take orders and deliver food to tables. This is distracting for someone trying to enjoy the music. \nI think it would be best if the restaurant was seperated from the stage area. \nThough the band I saw at The Compound was awesome, I would probably not go back to The Compound for a concert unless it was a band I was truly dying to see. The set up of this place I find just that bad. \nI may go back to try the food, but as far as seeing a band here the experience wasn't that great to make me come back for a concert."
1,"I'm still on the fence when it comes to JJ's. Sometimes I get a sandwich I really enjoy and other times it is just mediocre. When they are on point it is much better than the other chain sandwich shops that have been around so I keep coming back here. I like the fact that the offer the \""Un-Wich,\"" I really like their bread but I do not eat bread that much so this option where the meats are wrapped in lettuce works out perfectly. The staff is always friendly and the order is usually ready once you pay and fill up your drink."
0,"I was very disappointed at their service and food. My family and friends family all went here for Easter lunch and our server was MIA most of the time and the food was dry or burnt. We tried to flag down our server to let her know about the burnt meatloaf but couldn't find her so we told the bus boy and he took the dish back. When finally our server came we had to reminder her of our returned food and she just nonchalantly told us it was taken off our bill because she thought we wouldn't want a new dish... Shouldn't she ask us first?!?! Then she added that the kitchen put the meatloaf and forgot about it. They knew the food was inedible but still brought it out to us?! I was totally disgusted at the servers behavior and the lack of attention and care the kitchen put into what the customers were eating. I would not go back, there are plenty of good restaurants with excellent service. I think the Cheesecake Factory is just a hype with overpriced, mediocre at best, food with bad service. The only friendly staff was the bus boy. Too bad I can't give 0 stars."

First of all, I was not told to bring them, my dog is just a puppy and barely 4 months. 4 months is time they need proof of raibies. I talked to the manager and I told him my puppy may not evan be 4 months yet, I got her from a rescue. He wanted proof that she was under 4 months old. REALLY ! You are an idiot. I will take my dog where we will both be treated with respect. I will never go to that store again. Poor management"
0,"I live close to Oregano's, and our family always wanted to try this place out. \nWhat a better occasion than trying it for my 21st wedding anniversary. It was very packed, so we had the impression it was going to be phenomenal food. We sat outside, and we immediately fell in love with the environment. We sit there for 20 minutes and we order some drinks. Our service was nothing spectacular, and the server fail to suggest any options. We ordered the Big Rig Pasta; a very dry pasta with no flavor whatsoever. My daughter ordered Lady is A Scampi, very dry pasta as well not worth the money. Furthermore, Alfredo the Dark was dry pasta, little sauce topped with tomato.  In addition, the wings were extremely salty. The pizza was good. The only thing we loved was the dessert! Never coming back, I'd rather stick to the regular Olive Garden or Malee's on Main."
1,"Reserved a room at the HardRock for my roommate's birthday and stayed there for 3 days, 2 nights at the Paradise Tower. Our room was very spacious with a lot of closet and drawer space (for 4 girls...!). Shoes, shoes, shoes. Lots of mirrors too! Another plus for a room full of 4 girls.\n\nThe bathroom had a beautiful dark red rock-damask design (weird combination right? but it works!) My only complaint about the bathroom was that the modern design of the showerhead made it have a lot less pressure than one would want -- it barely took the shampoo out! Looks nice, doesn't function as it should.\n\n+1 for room service & the cleanliness of the overall hotel\n\n+1 for the sun-blocking curtains that let us sleep well into the day!\n\n+1 for carrying out the Hard Rock concept so well \n\n+1 for the two really good clubs in the lobby. Packed & poppin. Strong drinks. Best DJ I've ever heard - played a whole chain of the best West Coast songs! Find a recruiter walking around though that will hook you (girls) up with free entrance as opposed to $20.\n \n-1 for charging us $45 for moving the mini-bar dollar shots. If you trigger the sliding sensor for more than 45 seconds, it does an auto-charge to your room bill! We contested this with the concierge and even told them to go back up to our room to confirm the dollar shots were still in place because there was NO WAY in hell we were going to pay $45 for 3 bottles of DOLLAR SHOTS."
0,"Vegetarian bbq sandwich -- gross. It was $7 to boot and nearly all bread.\n\nCornbread -- delicious! Sweet and moist. The small is $0.49 and it is a little 4-bite muffin. I could have eaten two large orders ($0.99 each, total 4 muffins) at once, so order more than you think you would ever eat and it should come out to the perfect size.\n\nRed beans and rice -- mediocre with huge chunks of sausage; about 3 oz per side dish for $1.29.\n\nUnless I get an intense craving for cornbread that warrants fighting campus traffic to get to Blues, I won't be going back."
1,"Cheers! Slante! Salud! We drive up from Casa Grande because we love Su Vino.  We have always had great service, have enjoyed the wines and the food.  It is not your typical \""Snottsdale\"" place.  The atmosphere and staff are very casual and welcoming.  We never feel rushed while we are there, in fact, we almost feel encouraged to linger and to enjoy ourselves. Su Vino has become one of our favorite places to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.  We look forward to our next visit and are planning on bottling our own for gifts."
1,"Walked in and ordered lunch; falafel pita and a side of rice. Would hope it would only take 10 min (since I was the only one there), but it took 20 min (minus half a star). The salad accompanying the pita was meh.. Iceberg lettuce, a couple slices of tomato, a handful of parsley and a vinaigrette. First off, let's get some real lettuce on a salad, f*** this iceberg crap. And how about some veggies? (minus half a star).\n\nNow the good. The falafel pita was damn good! Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside and tons of flavor. The hummus on top completed it. All that served in a pita that was thinner and had a little bit of a crisp to it was tasty. The rice was delicious as well; simple white rice with good seasoning and cooked perfectly. \n\nOverall I will be going back, though I may call ahead to minimize the wait."
0,"This coffee shop has a lot of problems but the products are decent. I got a cup of vegetarian chili, which was decent but I know it was old because he microwaved it. My first latte was really good, smooth and flavorful. My second latte was almost all foam and I think the milk was burned. \n\nBut the lack of wifi and the fact that you can't use cell phones (which btw...is not posted and you just get a sign shoved in your face when you're on your phone the first time) are the reasons I will never be going back."
0,"Everything is awesome except the food.\n\nInteresting menu, nice staff, fun concept, but aside from the beignets(which are only passable as something other than beignets) - the food is somewhere between subpar and plain ol terrible.\n\nOrdered a burrito, a quesadilla, some nacho-tots, and the beignets so felt like we tried it all.  There were 2 issues with every single thing we ordered.\n\n1) the ingredients weren't very good (Kinda like someone emptied out microwave burritos instead of making rice, meat, veggies, etc...)\n\n2) The food is poorly prepared.  The kids that work there are very nice but they put so much buffalo sauce on the quesadilla that it was inedible, and the burrito was layered like a parfait so that each bite was a single but different ingredient.\n\nMight try again some day but doubt it."

0,"Eh, not impressed at all.  Neither was my wife.  The menus is rather small (which, I guess you expect from a gastropub) and the range of food we ordered left a lot to be desired.

The service was great; the decor was wonderful; but the experience just didnt' do it for me.\n\nFor that price, we should have gone to L'Atelier next door."

0,"Plusses\n- Plenty of parking: Fran's is located in the same strip mall with Run for your Life and Fiamma, which means there's parking galore.\n- Attentive waitstaff: Fran herself came over to chat with us and brought crayons for the 2 year old at our table\n- Ecclectic homey food: bacon wrapped tator tots?  Fried sweet corn with goat cheese ranch dressing?  Meatballs with gooey melted cheese?  Don't mind if I do.\n- Generous portion size: I like to eat, as does everyone I was with, and we were stuffed after our meal.  \n- Price: reasonable, especially considering portion size.  The seafood options are a bit more expensive, but that's to be expected.\n\nMinusses\n- Odd table layout: the front room holds ~10 tables and bar seating, but as you head to the bathroom in the back, there are tables along the hallway and oddly placed near the kitchen pickup window\n- Menu confusion: Reading the menu, I just want to exclaim \""what IS this place?\""  Deviled eggs, nicoise salad, eggplant parmesan, buffalo fried chicken sandwich, and mussels (three ways: traditional, curry/coconut, or beer/bacon) all co-habitate on the menu.  On one hand, that might mean everyone can find something they like.  On the other hand, it's just weird.  What does Fran's want to be when it grows up?  \n- Food quality & flavors: it's not bad, but it's not amazing either.  The macaroni & cheese side was bland, the lamb ragu was not as good as it had been talked up to be, the chicken milanese was just so-so.  However, the goat cheese was incredible; the goat cheese ranch dressing is a wonderful little cup of surprise (dunk all the way to the bottom, and you'll be rewarded with chunks of soft goat cheese.  You're welcome) and the goat cheese salad that came with the chicken milanese was my favorite of the whole meal.  Moral of the story: if it has goat cheese, GET IT."
0,"If it weren't for the beautiful lobby and the friendly reception staff, I would give this place a zero. Well, that and the fact that Yelp doesn't allow for Zeros. Point being, this place SUCKS and you should not go there. I repeat, DO NOT GO TO DENTAL SPECIALITY ASSOCIATES FOR ANY REASON. I visited DSA in September 2013. I went at the recommendation of my insurance company. The second I walked out the door after my appointment, I contacted my insurance provider and changed my primary dentist to anyone BUT these people. My appointment was made same-day as I was in extreme tooth pain and needed to be seen. When I got to DSA, they promptly placed me in a room with an oral hygenist who took my x-rays. We were off to a great start. After that, I was placed in an exam room where I waited about twenty minutes to see my dentist, Dr. Lior Berger. Dr. Berger was rough with his hands, pushing and pulling in my mouth and knocking metal things and cold against my teeth to determine my issue(s). I understood that this may need to take place given that I was in extreme pain. I silently endured his torture. He did not speak to me really, he preferred to bark numbers and orders at his staff. They were nearby with my chart taking notes. After my exam by Dr. Berger, I was escorted to the \""finances\"" department where they would go over my treatment plan. Long story short, I went in with a DENTAL EMERGENCY and left with NO SOLUTION to my problem. As a matter of fact, what I DID leave with was a \""treatment plan\"" that included 3 root canals, 2 crowns, a two stage tooth cleaning and multiple cavities needing to be filled. All for the low, lo price of $3,000+ AFTER insurance!!! Um, no. \n\nI left DSA and never went back. I wasn't really bothered enough to write a Yelp review at the time because I knew that I was smart enough not to pay $3,000 for tooth treatment that wasn't actually causing me pain. I figured most other people would be the same. However, as of the past 72 hours, I feel a bit differently. \n\nToday is Sunday. Thursday night I got no sleep because of a recurrence of the pain in my teeth / jaw. I knew I couldn't go back to DSA. I visited another dentist's office about two miles away. On Friday morning, I had yet another emergency exam to help identify the pain that I had been having in my mouth. I was at the dentist's office for over two hours. Multiple dentists consulted on my case. It turns out I needed ZERO root canals. My tooth pain is actually not tooth pain at all. I was diagnosed with TMJ. So, had I listened to Dr. Berger, I would have had three unnecessary root canals along with all kinds of other stuff that would not have helped my pain. The new dentist told me my issue is not with my teeth at all but rather pain is coming from my jaw and muscles around my mouth. They prescribed me a muscle relaxer to bring down my swelling / inflammation and took impressions to have  a night-time mouth guard made. My guard will be made and ready for me to pick it up in two and a half weeks. My cost- $240. Dr. Berger tried to scam me for a TON of money. I am devastated that there are people in the medical field who operate with morals like this. Unbelievable."
0,"Not a fan of big casino hotels but I didn't have a choice on this one. The line for check-in was enormous, as was the line to store baggage. It took more than 30 minutes to drop off a bag (and 30 minutes more to pick it up) while waiting for my room.\n\nThe room is extremely dark. Good thing I don't wear makeup because you couldn't see anything in the bathroom. Could barely see the soap I showered with. The lights at the night stand were both out and the alarm was left on (check these things, people!) so I had a friendly 5:37 a.m. wakeup buzz.\n\nThe mandatory resort fee was $22 per night or so, and didn't include a seat by the pool, which requires that you spend wads of cash on food and drink for the privilege of sitting on a chair. I was shooed away at 10:30 a.m. when no one else was there because I wouldn't plunk down the cash.\n\nThe \""free\"" pool closes at 6 p.m. Stupid, like the hours for the gym, which is only open from like 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nThe big deal-breaker is that they don't have coffee makers in the room, like most casino hotels. I always thought that a hotel in Vegas with a coffee maker and bright lights in the rooms could make a fortune.\n\nP.S. Not impressed by the rock-and-roll memorabilia."
0,"The Sushi is good but the service is atrocious -- 40 minutes to get a bowl of miso soup. Worse, there is no soap and not even a dispenser in their restroom. Makes me wonder what their employees are using to wash their hand and what God awful disease I am going to catch after eating there."
1,"I had a great time at Kai last week. Let me start by saying that if I could give the service 10 stars I would.  So I know I am not the norm for not giving kai a 5 star review, but I dined at ALEX in Vegas like 1 week before I ate this meal, so I had a huge benchmark to hurdle. I cannot say enough about how good the service is here.. Not stuffy, stupid attentive, and some of the most friendly staff I have encountered. THE FOOD: Some dishes were outstanding, some dishes missed the mark.. 4 people, 3 of us had 4 courses ala carte, all different, and my wife had the tasting menu. We ran the gammit, I was wafer-thin full when I was done. THE HIGHS: Lobster degustation, buffalo tenderloin, Fois Gras, and the Goat meat was insane, as was the heirloom tomato tarte. THE NOT SO GOOD: Over cooked Veal Ribeye, The goat cheese fondue side for the NY Strip..(Think millionares ranch dressing) Some of the garnish and sides were undercooked, or a little soggy.(Truffle oil pom frittes) Probably the best souffle I have ever had... The decor and atmosphere warrant 1 star. Seriously guys.. 50 bucks a plate, and there is no transformation to a different stratesphere.. expectation at this 5 diamond level are Micheal Jordan high, but smudges all over the glass wall definetely do not help the surroundings. 4 People, 4 hours, 800 bucks, a smashing time, a great experience, Stated already: Best service in Maricopa county.. People make the experience.."
1,"For all those $.25 chicken wing lovers, I know your world came crumbling down that the deal was canceled. But behold, I have wonderful news!! IT\""S BACK!!!! \n\nWe came here for the graveyard special- $.25 chicken wings!!! There's a few rules about it though- you have to be an owl rewards card holder (you can join at the restaurant), you have to order a non-refillable drink for $1.50, and you must order in denominations of 10. Other than that, go wild!! We got 40 last night- 1/2 honey BBQ (YUM!!) and 1/2 medium (not so yum). Our server was CeCe- she was freakin awesome!! This was my first time here and it was overall a great way to end the night."

0,"Meh. We ordered quite the smorgasbord & I wasn't delighted with anything. My veggie roll was large but not very tasteful, same goes for my boyfriend's shrimp roll. The Crab Rangoon was lacking in any filling- I felt like I was biting into deep fried air! Our veggie moo shu was boring & had no egg in it? The wraps for the moo shu made me feel like I was eating paper. The bf ordered General Tso's chicken & said it was decent. I wouldn't order from this place again unless I had no other choices..."
1,"Good food, good salsa choices.  The fish taco's were really good.  Just wish they could have come baked, broiled or grilled in place offried.  Still, very yummy."
0,"I didn't eat here, but I can't believe you who ranked this more than three stars!\n\nI repeatedly did not enjoy getting hassled by the incompetent door person, sitting at sticky tables, overpriced, badbadbad tropical house gin drinks, stupid stunts, or loud bad music.  The oxygen bar is a gimmick."
1,"How does one measure a little donut shop? As far as I'm concerned, one measures it by the friendliness of the staff, and the availability of fresh, delicious donuts.\n\nThe family that opened this donut shop is amazingly friendly. I've been in there at traditional times (Saturday or Sunday morning) but also odd times like Friday night. They always have an incredible array of fresh donuts that are way better than the competition, in my view. Krispy Kreme can go home."
0,"Black Chile was the name of the previous restaurant that occupied the space. Just a tidbit. Now to the review:\n\nThe hostess was very nice and polite to us and we were greeted quickly. A major plus in my book.  We really didn't have to wait on a Friday because a sit at the bar opened up...I am walking to the bar with my wife. My nose is assaulted with the worst smell, the smell that only comes from bars that make fruity drinks and use fresh ingredients.  I can't knock 'em but they need candles or something.  \n\nToo the food we go:\n\nSalsa and chips. Check.  The salsa is legit.  I could order that all day.  \nFajita's. Meh...salty, salty, salty. Good portion but you will need water.  \n\nOverall thoughts:\nI am trying to step out of my box because I am a creature of habit. Ya...I prolly won't go back."
0,"Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar, but good luck getting served.  If it is crowded or the bar is just full I've always had to wait to get served.\n\nThe beer selection is decent, but not all that big.  For a much larger beer selection check out Buffalo Blues a few blocks down the road.\n\nThe best part is the patio, if you want decent food and good outdoor seating, Harris is a good choice - if you don't mind waiting."
0,"Stopped here for a byte to eat with about 8 people.  They would not let us in because our children are under 6.   Honestly, I have never heard of such a policy.   I believe they have the right to refuse service to people, heck Ill take my $100 to someone that wants it, but this seemed kind of silly and mostly rude.\n\nI could see not allowing children under 21, maybe 18... but what is so magical about six and under?"
1,Pizza was amazing. The staff was not the best but wasn't horrible either. The only thing I would change is their seating. The chairs are very hard and little. My booty kept going numb throughout dinner lol :)
1,"Impressive collection of local artist handcrafted work - pottery, wood, tile, glass, paper, jewelry, fiber...so many beautiful things to look at and touch. Everytime I stop in I end up finding something special, either for myself or as a gift -  Knowledgeable and friendly staff - a definite yes!"
1,"They had me at fresh squeezed pineapple juice.  We were in Scottsdale for spring training and came here on the advice of a friend.  Thank you, friend!  We enjoyed our meal so much we came back the following day.  Again, fresh squeezed pineapple juice, heavenly."
1,I've gone here twice and been extremely satisfied both times. The first was after I'd tried to go to pink nails first thing in the morning right as they opened and they already had like ten people in there and that was a joke. So on the way home I found this little place tucked away. I walked in and was taken immediately. The techs were chatty and funny. My nails looked flawless for the holiday and they were super quick. I went back today and got a gel mani and pedi. I had them remove my acrylics which I'm always hesitant to do and they actually took the time to soak the acrylics off instead of ripping them off like the last few places I've been. Again I walked in today and there was no wait. Someone immediately took me to a pedi chair. Lots of magazines and looked clean. This might be my permanent place. Only thing I didn't like was for some reason they like peeled the old gel polish off of my toes instead of nail polish remover. Well have to see if they do it again
0,"I've been in herbally grounded a few times and the only two times I have needed help the costumer service was HORRIBLE! The first bad experience was the lady ringing all my items was sick, she was wiping her hand thru the snot on her nose then touching my items. GROSS! Then the next visit I asked a different woman named summer I believe for her assistance and she was just so rude. Making sarcastic remarks, always needing to have the last word and when I asked if she was positive ( because she seemed unsure and I didn't want to buy the wrong thing) she threw her hands up and walked away. Makes not want to ever shop there again."
0,"Ordered the Aged Rib Eye and was almost uneatable, It had no taste and consisity of a NY, the wine I had to send back. never go there again"
1,"This was my first time going to 5 church to actually eat except for a yelp event last year.  I was pretty impressed with the service, the food and the ambiance.  \n\nFood:  I actually wasn't THAT impressed with the menu options.  I mean they had a couple things to choose from but nothing stood out as unique and nothing tempted me.  They have steaks, a chicken dish, salmon but so what.  So, we decided to just order a bunch of appetizers and sides to enjoy a variety from the menu.  We started with the black bean hummus and fried calamari and both were very good.  The hummus was a pretty good size portion considering it was only $4 and it was served with yummy flat bread/chips.  The calamari was very good--not too much breading, not too chewy, fresh, crispy, etc.  It was served with some type of spicy dipping sauce that was different than anything I have had before but also very good.  Next we went with the bacon pizza and a side of broccoli (random I know).  The pizza was so good.  Thin crust doesn't even describe it...it was more like no crust but it was still very tasty.  The cheese was just enough and the bacon pieces were plump and crispy.  It came out piping hot.  The broccoli was supposed to be family-size but it was more like small child size.  However, the broccoli was marinated in garlic and olive oil and it was cooked to perfection.  I mean my breath was hot for 2 days after due to the amount of garlic but it was worth it!  The drink menu was plentiful but the prices were a bit high.  They offered very few glasses of wine but they had plenty of other beers, cocktails, etc.\n\nService:  The service was very good by way of attentiveness.  I wouldn't say the crew was the most professional or polished in their approach but there were pretty available and efficient when needed and overall very friendly.  \n\nAmbiance:  Such a cool looking restaurant.  I love how they decorated it....it has a gothic, chic, trendy feel.  It is just gorgeous.  The nightlife scene is pretty hopping after the dinner hours.  It has a more mature crowd I would say overall but quite a few young professionals.  \n\nGood food, nice atmosphere.  I will be back."
0,"Maybe it was the fact that I got the burger well done but it was dry. The sweet potato fries were great, however. I was there with a large party, about 15 of us from a meetup I attend. The service was great, I didn't have a problem with it. I hear their desserts are world class. Next time I visit I will give that a go and hopefully rereview."
1,"I was about to buy a new set of tires at Walmart, when I decided to check this nearby place first, just to compare.  How about $100 LESS at Firestone!  I got a complete set of new tires with a 450 Treadwear Rating for $143.47 out the door, mounted, balanced, & stems!\n\nDuring the installation, I walked down the street to La Olmeca for one of their excellent breakfasts, & my car was ready shortly after I got back.  Total time (for the car) at Firestone was only about an hour, without an appointment.  Terrific experience all around!!"
1,"We have been to Leroy Fox several times and our most recent visit was a couple nights ago.  We were seated quickly upon arrival and the server took our drink order right away. It was fairly crowded for a Tuesday night.  The place has a comfortable feel. There are booths, tables, and you can sit at the bar. Behind the bar are many TVs.  My wife and mother-in-law ordered the fried chicken.  I had the chicken fried steak and my son had the BBQ sandwich and my daughter had the mac and cheese. A couple, pieces of the fried chicken were not cooked thoroughly so we sent it back. Two entire meals were returned to us and they comped our desserts.  They handled the situation perfectly. Things can happen once in a while anywhere but the way it is handled is what counts the most and Leroy Fox knows customer service better than most. The food was very good. My daughter loves the mac and cheeses and my chicken steak was delicious.  The asparagus and fries are also good. The desserts were tasty too.  The food, service and ambiance are all reasons to return to the Fox.  It is a good value too."
1,I cannot say enough good things about this place. This is the greatest place for women's health care and spa treatments and tons of other services.
1,"Went back, still perfect service and staff, still great food, still huge rooms for a fair price.  Love the walking trails.  Going back again!"
0,"Stay away from this goat ranch!  For some odd reason, the staff thinks that their course is in \""great condition\""......it's not!  It looks more like a very average muni!  We were in Vegas from out of town and arrived 30 minutes prior to our tee time at 11:00.  The pro shop told us that they were running a few minutes behind......which was actually 30!  The pace of play is very slow and the price was ridiculous."
0,"As a child (along with Burger King), Kentucky Fried Chicken (as it was called then), was my favorite fast food restaurant. You couldn't go wrong with the \""Original Recipe\"" (only option back then... it was just called chicken because there was no \""Extra Crispy\"") and mashed potatoes.  Sure the coleslaw made me vomit through my nose (just wasn't ready for it then), but Kentucky Fried Chicken was the best.\n\nYears later, \""Extra Crispy\"" became available and I realized how hard the \""Original Recipe's\"" texture sucked!\n\nNovelty drove me to KFC yesterday.  I went with the white meat combo ... \""Extra Crispy\"".  I started with the chicken.  The batter was really caked on.  I forgot haw thick the layers of batter get with KFC.  My initial bite started off satisfying, the flavors helped me relive those great fast foodie moments of my childhood.  From there, the mirage took off.\n\nThe batter is caked on so thickly that there is a space between the chicken and the crispy exterior that's moist mush.  It was so disgusting, I could only eat select portions of the batter I knew were crisp.  \n\nThe chicken was so far from free-range, it tasted as if were raised in a can.  The breast was moist, but it oddly had the flavor and some of the texture of thigh meat (I can't stand dark meat chicken). \n\nI went with the wedges.  They are flavored like curly fries, but with twice the seasoning.  The first part of the bite was solid, but the guts of the wedges were a mushy potato with the consistency of mashed potatoes -- yeah, deep-fried mashed potatoes --- %&u% GROSS!\n\nThe only thing I finished here was the soda.  I hope in 10 years, when I consider coming back, I read this review and realize some things are best left in childhood."
1,Wow! Best Sandwich this the valley - Try the #12 you will not regreat- they even ship this sandwiches to NYC
1,"This place knows how to make a mean burger. Their ingredients are paired so well and everything is delicious! \n\nThey're a bit pricey but it's worth it every once in a while. I ordered the Kiki burger, and will definitely be getting it again."

0,"Don't bother. Any breakfast dish will disappoint, but the OJ is great."
0,"To begin, the service was great.  However, the ravioli seemed frozen and the meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs were flavorless.  A lackluster meal all around."
1,"Ive climbed Echo Canyon trail and Cholla trail over 100 times and they never disappoint. This mountain has something for everyone; 1) convenient location, 2) good looking crowd to help motivate your climbing, 3) best views in the valley of the sun, 4) you can make the hike as challenging as you want by running to the top and/or going up/down multiple times. Ive seen the elderly, obese people, and kids as young as 6 or 7 make it to the top (although if you are in this demo i would highly recommend to take your time and rest often). Echo Canyon is currently closed for maintenance so I did Cholla yesterday at 12 noon, 103F, up and down in 1:15, 950 calories. Be sure to bring plenty of water and be sure to look for the blue dots to help stay on the trail...it's easy to go off the trail by accident FYI."
1,"Visited this hidden gem on a Sunday night. The biggest downfall is that, if you are not familiar with PV mall, it is so hard to find! There are virtually no signs in the parking lot of the entire mall telling you where the theater is. The best way is to park on the bottom floor of the parking garage, and the closest entrance will lead you straight to the theater. \n\nThe prices are here are some of the cheapest around - and why pay more to see the same movie? When I was there I bought two hot dogs, a bottled water, and a large soda and only spent around $8. AWESOME compared to some of the bigger movie theaters. \n\nSeats are comfy, usually isn't very crowded, and staff is friendly. Definitely recommended!"
1,"More like 3.5 stars. Ate the $7.77 Gambler's Special that's not on the menu..not once, but twice! Seriously, delicious and satisfying. My friends thought I was a genius because I knew about this little trick. Could not eat it all both times. Steak, jumbo shrimp on a skewer, mashed or baked potato and a salad. The salad was ridiculously big and the ranch was yuummy!\n\nIf you order to go..they charge a buck and it's still worth it to eat on the floor of my room. Service wasn't spectacular.\n\nAte breakfast here one day on our trip and wasn't impressed with the omelette...too much milk and cheese and not a lot of veggies. Go cheaper and get a few eggs and hashbrowns. Perfect before you hit mid-day drinking :)\n\nWhat a deal! I heart you Gambler's Special!"
1,"Used to come to this library often while I was in school.  Haven't come here many times after 2007.  But still come here once or twice just to vote for City of Phoenix elections.  Very good location right by PV Mall and near SR-51 and Loop-101.  I believe the city cut the library hours, so this location doesn't even open on Fridays anymore.  But I would agreed on the good librarians working in the library."
1,"This is the only nightclub I've been to in Vegas, but it's still thus far the nicest I've been to period. Even though we bought those VIP tickets through eBay before our trip, it wasn't necessary because we were bombarded with those people on their sidekicks trying to get us on their guestlist. They are usually hanging around the forum chops at Caesars or those shops inside the Venetian. Anyway, so we ended up being on guestlist and got those passes and we got in amazingly quickly. We got to the place around 10 PM and got in within 10 minutes. The girls got in for free and the guys paid $20 instead of $30. Our guy:girl ratio was 1:1, but I saw some people with a ton of guys that had some trouble getting in, but they got in eventually (not sure if they had to pay extra).\n\nThe club was packed inside for a Thursday night. It was super nice with a dance floor and dining on the first floor (which probably cost an arm and a leg to eat at) and more dancing upstairs and also a bar. They had girl dancers and seducers (the girls that massaged one another) everywhere. The decor was all pan-Asian. Drinks at the bar didn't take too long either with most drinks costing around $10. Music was good too although after being there for 2 hours, they repeated all the songs once. \n\nThe VIP areas were super nice. They had the whole sections roped off with girl dancers in there that lit your cigarette or made you a drink to order. The bouncers also took care of their business at the entrances. There were these girls dancing up on the elevated stage thing, and the VIPs told the bouncers that they wanted to dance on there so the bouncers told the girls that were dancing to get off so the VIPs could dance on the stage haha. \n\nAll in all a good experience. The worst part was probably trying to leave because it took like half an hour to push through the crowds. But after you get out, just take the escalator downstairs and turn to your left and you have the Venetian Poker Room! Awesome. Play until 4 AM and then sleep until forever the next day..."
0,"Too bad, they have a great location in Old Town.  Small patio, that is filled with smokers, small inside bar, but first you have to get past those smokers.   Beers were warm, kept in a small fridge, constantly being opened.  \n\nLive music inside, too loud for such a small space.  Oh, BTW, did I mention the smoke?"
0,"about 10 odd years ago, when i was a newbie to the dim sum world.  i had heard about this place in las vegas.  yeah, it was a damn good food experience, b/c i was from reno where there was no chinese restaurant serving dim sum.  the place has received many awards over the course of the years.  it was such a nice restaurant in those days.  now the pink decor has gone to crap.  it just seems a lot dirtier now.  i have to say each time i go to this place the quality has been on a steady decline.  the basic steam items, such as siumai,har gow, and also the deep fried items...crab claw,  were not spectacular.  the salt-pepper fried shrimp have been sitting out a long time, so they were chewy more than crunchy.  i think i cut my inner lip chewing on the shrimp head.  i didnt see the mango pudding or egg tarts the last time.  im also sad that they didnt have my favorite shark fin dumpling soup item with red vinegar.  finally, a lot of the dishes have been sitting out for a long time.  i was just afraid to touch them.  i still cant believe that this place is so busy.  ive had to wait quite a while the last few times ive come here.  i definitely have to find a better place for dim sum."
0,"The Skinny: the desserts are okay but (3) the service is terrible for a weekend brunch in a restaurant that isn't even full - what's a gal gotta to do to get some water around here? there's an excessive heat wave outside, people!!!(1) value: the dessert tasting is okay but so not worth the aggrevation (1).\n\nWe arrived at Max Brenner for a relaxing Saturday brunch. Turns out our experience was anything but relaxing. \n\nInitially, we were seated promptly by the hostess and waited. And waited. And waited. We sat there with our menus with no one taking a drink order. Our waitress shows up and tells us that she'll be right with us. Afterwards she just disappeared on us again. Another long interlude passes.\n\nAt this point, I was thinking about chewing on a napkin and wondering if I should just get some water upstairs from the sink in the bathroom. \n\nFinally she shows up and takes our orders. Water takes forever to come and so does our orders. We stayed at the restaurant for 2 hours... for them to make a plate of eggs, a burger with fries, a waffle and a fried chocolate egg roll. Plus, there's an excessive heat warning outside and they take forever to refill your water glasses (which are surprising tiny - their hug mugs hold about as much liquid). I think in the two hour time span, they got refilled once. May I remind you, this is while you are eating some incredibly rich food.\n\nThe real food itself is okay (ie, the burger and the omelette). Nothing earth shattering.\n\nThe dessert tasting is both overwhelming in richness, underwhelming in quality.  I think in the end, the dessert tasting really lacked a good editing eye.\n\nTasting includes: a belgian waffle with syrup, caramelized banana, nuts with choice of ice cream and chocolate ganache; fried chocolate eggroll with Mexican spices ?bananas and peanuts; two different chocolate \""bark\""; a bowl of chocolate krispies; a fondue set with strawberries, bananas, and marshmallows (and hibachi for roasting).\n\nThe belgian waffle is too overloaded with stuff. First, you have the syrup, nuts and caramelized bananas. Then you drown it in ice cream and chocolate ganache? The waffle at this point is totally lost in the whole process - becoming soggy from all the ingredients. It's just too much.\n\nThe fried eggroll was filled with a chile pepper spiced chocolate with banana and peanuts inside. Albeit it was different and interesting, the eggroll became soggy from the chocolate inside.\n\nMy husband and I found the two chocolate bars and chocolate covered rice krispies (supposedly malt balls but I didn't taste any malt flavouring) to be too sweet in combination with everything else. The brownies were okay, not great. \n\nThe fondue (dark chocolate, baby!) was alright. We were wondering about the fire hazard we were going to create because flame kept setting our marshmallows on fire.\n\nHonestly, the dessert tasting is okay - would probably share it with 3-4 instead of 2 because it is really too much for two to handle. However, factor in all the other things like crappy service I have to say a 2 star review."
1,"Friendly staff, easy enough to find, and very good coffee. Definitely gonna be one of my new haunts."
1,"I have been to Marigold's several times. This is partly because it was close to my old place. I only go there for brunch. The place is really cute and cozy. Sometimes it's CRAZY busy so be prepared to wait. \n\nThey have super good pancakes. This is mostly because the syrup is so good! Also their roasted potatoes are so yum! The breakfast sandwich is VERY good too.  Also I love that they always have great pastries. Say yes to the muffins!\n\nIf you're in Madison, WI this is a nice place to have brunch."
1,Saw a review or two before going.  Love the PBJ brioche and plan to try a new pastry each visit.  The ham and cheese on pretzel bread was indescribably amazing.  Possibly my favorite new sandwich.  Be back there soon.
1,"If you don't want to go to bed drunk on an empty stomach while staying at the Valley Ho, I highly recommend the fries with the sriracha aoli! If you're still not drunk enough, order a dirty martini while you wait for your fries."
1,"Went in there last weekend to purchase some watercolors! This place looks small from outside but is in fact pretty large inside. Did not have time to peruse throughout the store but will go there when I have more time again.\n\nThe watercolor selection is limited as in they do not carry a ton of different brands. The lady at the cashier stand was not very helpful nor was she friendly. It was a sunday and it looked like she really did not like being there. \n\nThey do carry different grains of watercolor paper which is great and I was helped by a nice gentleman with picking out some for me. He even pointed out the one that was a really good grain and was on sale that week. \n\nThe store is slightly unorganized as in the watercolors were in one section, the brushes were in a totally seperate section and then I couldn't find the watercolor paper anywhere until the associate helped me. They also have some books on different art subjects but again they too are unorganized. Some are near the seating area...right near the cashiers and then the rest are supposed to be on the far wall. Didn't have a chance to walk all the way over there. Did I mention, this place is huge. They also hold weekly watercolor and sketching classes at this place. \n\nAnyway, I will be making my future watercolor supplies purchases from Jerry's Artarama. It was easy to find and a basic no nonsense place."
0,"The mother wanted some vietnamese food,  specifically this sweet and sour soup and clay pot fish ( canh chua and ca kho ) so we gave this place a try and was a huge disappointment. \n\nWhen I first walked in, the smell of the place already threw me off. Even at a bad vietnamese restaurant, you get the delicious pho smell but not here, no delicious smell to match the not so delicious food. \n\nAnyways we also ordered eggrolls and it only came as 2 in an order and the fresh vegetables that came with it wasn't so fresh. The dipping sauce was on the salty side so was the soup that we ordered so I'm guessing it's a theme. We barely ate the clay pot fish since there was nothing special about it. \n\nIn the end, definitely not worth the 35 dollars spent there."
0,I am an OB card member.  We signed up for our memberships at Legacy.  I played the course in the summer and despite the heat the course was in good shape.  We played again today and the majority of the course was in good shape but there were several greens that had dead spots (no grass) and it looked as if they tried to cover up the spots with green chemicals of some sort.  Some of the cart paths had concrete that was broken in spots.  I guess for $49 I just expected the course to be in better shape and expected a little more of a top tier experience.  Now lets get to the worst part.  I decided to eat in the clubhouse after the round.  Bad idea.  Worst burger and bun I have ever had and I still have an upset stomach hours later.  I understand that golf courses really exist for one purpose but I feel like if you are going to have a restaurant and offer food that you should try to serve decent food.  So for the value the course was not very good and the restaurant was horrible.  We won't be back anytime soon and we certainly will not eat in the restaurant again.

1,Awesome foods and great services !!!
1,"We have eaten here several times, the latest was earlier this month for a birthday party.  We love the prime rib and Yorkshire pudding but I have two comments.  The salad was so overdressed, I couldn't eat it.  And I think we should get more Yorkshire pudding, which is my favorite.  Other than that, the service is always good, we enjoyed the carolers and we had our usual good time there."
0,Wow I have never had such a nasty room in Vegas. Dirty room asked to be switched and they moved me into a room with a broken bed. I spent ten minutes sitting in the hallway in between moves. They did nothing to compensate for the hassle. DO NOT STAY HERE. I'll be lucky if I don't get bed bugs. Serious yuck.\nNight life is fun here but stay sleep elsewhere.  ZERO STARS!!
1,"I took my kids when they were younger to Pueblo Peds and they were ALWAYS amazing great! They were speedy, helpful and always concerned about the care for my children. I highly suggest them!"
1,"I picked up an egg, cheese, and potato breakfast burrito to eat during my flight.  I had it for about two hours and it kept really well!  It would be extremely easy to slap this combination together for a tasteless boring burrito.  I'm happy to report that it was not at all.  I definitely recommend getting the salsa they offer when you pick up your order.  \n\nIf you want a meal to carry on that keeps well, this is a great choice.  Staff were very friendly as well."
0,"This bar is has country western decor around,it's a outdoorsy place, Really good for a smokers I'm not a fan but if you are  smoker it's the bar for you love the decorations, wasn't too busy when I was there as I drove by later that evening and was a lot more people and seems to be more of a place for the locals."
0,"Great service, beer selection, and cozy atmosphere.  Avoid the pretzels and house brats.  Maybe i got an old pretzel but quality control is badly needed there.  Bratwurst was way too modern and did not taste good.  Stick with traditional German food and i will come back."
1,"Forget Bouchon or Sinatra.. the first place we wanted to revisit to on our second trip to Vegas was the Peppermill.\n\nIt's not how surprisingly great the food is, the totally vintage and tacky decor, or the fact that it's open 24 hours. \n\nIt's that awesome fireside lounge. If it's not busy you can get a seat right infront of the fire. If not, it's not so bad either, you can curl up on the couches and watch random music videos while nursing a bloody mary all night.\n\nIn the restaurant, the girls are dressed like Hooters girls, in the lounge they're dressed like prom queens in full on gowns. With that said, the lounge is NOT fancy, it's just a cool place to drink and be comfortable.\n\nAgain, still love the Peppermill and I'll probably come back here every time I visit Vegas."
1,"Nice views but not the best. Drinks were pricey but excellently made by warm and very friendly servers.\n\nGreat vibe, good tunes at right volume, and very comfortable seats.\n\nThe nut tray is a plus.\n\nIf i were staying at City Center or Cosmo, id return."
0,"I don't like giving low star reviews but i'm sorry my experience here was very poor. The two stars are for the food but i would give five for the environment and decorations.\n\nWhen we first came in it was pretty crowded even for a wednesday night at 7:30. They had 2 or 3 open tables but they were too close to other people so we sat at the bar. There was no sign saying please wait to be seated or seat yourself and it appeared that the host was also the waiter and maybe even the cook. Once we sat at the bar a woman greeted us and provided us with menu and asked us what we would like to drink. I asked for a margarita and she said \""do you have tequila.\"" i didn't understand the question seeing that this was a bar and tequila is what is served in a margarita. Then she says that they don't have a liquor license but if i had brought my own they could prepare one for me. I was completely caught off guard especially since they have bar glasses that hang above their drink station and a whole rack of what are now empty wine bottles. Very misleading..BYOB is cool but don't have a bar look exactly like a bar then tell me you don't serve alcohol, what a rip! They even had one of those rubber drink mats that said Patron tequila on it so what the hell?? \n\nAny who, I asked for a virgin margarita that she said she could make and of course after 30 minutes she must have forgot because it never arrived at the table. I decided to just go with a water and one of the bottled mexican sodas, Jarritos. We ordered the avocado fries which was $8 so I assumed we would receive plenty. When the plate arrived it was a measly 6 slices of avocado with salsa evenly placed around a plate on a bed of lettuce. (see photo) I was like WTH is this. $8 for these little slices, It had to be only half of an actual avocado and the fact that i was splitting it with my sister made it even worse. After the app we looked over the menu which appeared to have alot of good choices. I chose the potato flautas and my sister order the curry goat.\n\nEach meal came with rice and beans, for mine it was mexican rice and hers was coconut rice. We waited about 15 minutes for our food to arrive and when it finally did boy did it look dry! The rice on both our plates was not moist at all and looked like it had been sitting wayyyy too long on the plate. My dish said it came with sour cream and lettuce which were both missing. I asked for the cream but she didn't even notice that the lettuce was missing. Before she brought my food she told me that they had run out of potato flautas so i said chicken was ok. Expecting chicken in my meal i bit into it and discovered that it was potato. I find it strange that you don't know what dish your serving your customers. The flautas were premade not in the store but probably from a box and they tossed large pieces of shredded cheese on top of the flautas which only partially melted so it just peeled off like dried elmers glue. Thy shell was way to thick and there was almost no potato inside. The beans were flavorless like they came straight out of the can and were just heated. The rice was ok but it also tasted like it came out of a box and had been sitting wayyyy too long. \n\nMy sisters meal was nothing to rave about either. She ordered the curry goat which once it came to her table was very dry with no curry on it whatsoever. When you think of curry you think of a thai place that makes it like a sauce for your rice. I've had plenty of caribbean food and this curry was not what real curry was supposed to be. they should have said curry flavored instead of curry goat. When she asked for more  sauce the waitress went to the kitchen and then returned saying that the curry is prepared with the dish so that there was no extra sauce on the side. WHAT??? How do you not have extra curry when it is essentially a sauce. I mean really people, it was like pulled pork without the BBQ sauce. (see pic) Her rice was dry and flavorless as well. Coconut rice is supposed to be sweet and a lil saucy but this stuff was like steamed white rice you get at a chinese spot. The only thing we ended up enjoying was the guacamole because it was very thick, creamy and had a little spice to it. Other than that all the rest of the food wasn't even worth my taste buds time.\n\nMy hubby came late and ordered a burrito with marinated pork. they brought out the burrito but with no sauce. He opened it up to see what was inside and it was 90 percent rice and beans and a few spoons of pork shreds. It tasted alot better than our meal but the fact that it came out dry AGAIN just left me shaking my head. After we finished our meal I was ready to pay and go. Unfortunately my hubby was talked in to ordering dessert. I protested but he couldn't resist. he ordered the churros and my sis got one of their truffles. The churros looked great when they came out but they were overcooked. the truffles were nothing to rave about either. \n\nEverything was DRY DRY DRY..I won't be going back!"
1,"Sushi Samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at The Shoppes at The Palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. \n\nThe three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.\n\nThe funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us."
0,"One word: over-hyped. \n\nThis place was so lame. The layout is absolutely terrible. It's a complete maze trying to find the other rooms. There are 2.5 levels (The top level is kind of a balcony level, which is absolutely pointless to go if you don't have a table since they line up the whole balcony.) \n\nThe bottom floor (floor 3) is the hip-hop room. We thought it was Top 40, which would be SO fun, but it turned out to be ghetto hip-hop. It was way cramped and small (almost the size of Lavo). (To get downstairs, the stairs are just right of the elevators. Don't ask the bouncers, most of them are total douches..)\n\nThe main floor, floor 4, which is where you get off of the elevator, is where all of the unse unse music is. This place is meant for ballers with table service. There isn't much room elsewhere. The walkways are tight like Marquee, and I can only imagine how impossible it is to get from one place to another on a full night. I'm still traumatized by the night at Marquee with Kaskade, but that's for another review.\n\nEven with a great girl-guy ratio, we had to buy tickets ($34 for the guys, $24 for the girls. Lame!!). One plus was that we didn't have to wait in line... Our other option was to be on the guest list, but they wanted PICTURES of the girls...we were like, what the hell?! I really don't like the vibe I get from this place. It was totally not worth the hype. We went to Tao the night before for free with no line either and had an absolute blast."
1,Great service. Will put you in agreat mood.
0,This place is going downhill fast. Always out of something you want to order. The food is great after you actually get it. It's such a shame I used to love this place. Took almost an hour to get yogurt and salad and ALL the waitstaff and managers look miserable. I guess it would be tough telling people you are out of something 50 times a day:/
1,"Mmmm, real gorgeous Italian food. Colin and I went in here for a late night dinner one night after seeing Monty Python's Spamalot in the playhouse (an amazing show may I add!) and before heading back to our hotel ('twas our anniversary, decided to make a weekend of it!) \n\nIt was about 10pm when we got out of the theatre, and decided that absolutely nowhere would still be serving food at this time, until Colin remembered he and his dad had went here for a late night meal once, so we popped over, were warmly welcomed, and taken to our table (which, as you can imagine at this time, there was an abundance of). \n\nService was impeccable, food was impeccable (how can you beat some good Italian pasta?!) (I've used so many parentheses in this review). \n\nGreat place to eat if you're down at the theatre and needing a late night place for some great food, and I do mean good food!"
0,"Absolutely Horrible Experience!!!  On July 10 my family dined here, I regret it and won't return.  Their exhaust system in the kitchen broke and the entire dining room was full of exhaust smoke.  It is a health hazard to breath that and it is a fire hazard also.  Their women's restroom was disgusting.  Garbage overflowing, no toilet paper or paper towels.  I have ate here several times but won't return after this visit.  I wasted $35 on a un-enjoyable experience.  The owner was present that night, He should have had the integrity of a business owner to close for the night."
1,"I'm about as far from a hardbody meathead as you can get. But they know me; I'm the guy who frequently comes in to get the freshly prepared low-carb meal replacement smoothie.\n\nThe smoothies are delicious. I'm still waiting for them to post their nutritional facts online, but I'm sure they're solid.\n\nTheir inventory of all things related to protein, vitamins, protein, HGH, and protein, and things that are protein-related, as well as protein, and good supplements for weight loss and fitness, like protein, is rather impressive. They apparently sell a lot, so they are able to keep their prices low. \n\nIf I wanted to buy anything related to fitness nutrition products, my first stop would be Amazon.com, but my next option would be One Stop Nutrition. And Amazon doesn't prepare fresh smoothies like these guys do.\n\nBy the way, the staff is ridiculously friendly and kind. Fantastic model for all retail."
1,"Fresh bread and the BEST. PEPPERONI ROLLS. EVER.\n\nThis is a special treat for me and hubby, and we always take our out-of-town guests to the Strip for one of these delicious treats."
1,"This was an amazingly great dining experience at Stripsteak. The $55 prix fixe menu is definitely worth trying. \n\nComplimentary:\nTrio of Duck fat fries (I'm not particularly excited for fries but I have got to say the 3 different flavors were something I've never tried before)\n\nAppetizer:\nMaryland Blue Crab Chowder: Chowda!! - ample servings of crab\n\nEntree:\nSlow-Poached Prime Rib of Beef: ordered medium rare but came out a bit more cooked than I liked. It was not as juicy as what I expected prime rib to be but nonetheless still very tasty. \n\nBone-in Rib eye: huge huge 18 oz slab of meat (an added $10 under the prix fixe menu)\n\nSides: All sides were so hearty, this included: Bacon-creamed spinach and mac & cheese (great but I normally don't indulge in such types of food)\n\nDesert:\nMichael's Root Beer Float: yummy! The chocolate chip cookies served on the side were way too sweet. \n\nIt was Valentine's Day so the restaurant also provided all diners complimentary caramel popcorn in a cute small bag to go along with some love tonic as the waitress explained (don't ask me, I have no idea what it is)."
0,"Um...no!\n\nChips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - \""made in New York City?!?!?)\n\nI had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.\n\nOverall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.\n\nService was mediocre. \n\nMoral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome."
1,"Carne Asada torta = mmmmmmmm! So yummy! I saw someone's review that says the tortas come with Ruffles, yes, they do... And it totally makes the sandwich. I think the balance is awesome with crunchy, spicy, etc. \n\nMake sure you get everything on it, if you don't, don't bother going. Also, ask for jalepenos and spicy carrots. \n\nThe tacos are Mexico City style, small tortillas and carne asada, tripe, tongue, pastor, etc. So good. I went to Mexico City in May 2010 and this is as close to the real thing that I can find in Phoenix. \n\nI also love that the owners are sometimes the cooks!"
0,"We ate there twice last week and will never eat there again.  We are from Casa Grande and went to a movie nearby and before we left I searched out seafood restaurants nearby.  This one looked good, and it was.  The second time my wife had a doctors appointment nearby, it was in the afternoon, so we decided to eat there again after a positive experience the first time.  Bad Choice.  The lunch menu prices are $1.00 less than the dinner menu.  We wanted the same items as we had on our first visit.  Scallops and oysters.  The lunch menu doesn't include salad or chowder.  Salad and Chowder is $2.50 extra on the lunch menu.  So you end up paying more at lunch for the same meal as on the dinner menu.  when I told the server we were disappointed, she sent the owner over.  What a pompous idiot.  I wont go into what he said. but he certainly did not try to please the customer.  I'd rate this place 4 stars for food and no stars for the the owner's attitude.  The host tried to smooth things over, but they wont see us again.  Our favorite Seafood restaurant is the Bluewater Grill.  Further away and more costly, but management goes out if it's way to make you happy.  At the Seafood Market they insult the customer.  NO THNAKS!!!!!!!"
1,"The circumstances:\nNightclub & Bar convention.\nI'm a manager at 105 in SF, and I train security about 200 deep in the Bay Area for dozens of clubs.\nRolling with a Posse of 4 bouncers around or over 300 pounds. 2 little fellas, 220 : ) and one fine girl. Doing bottle service.\n\nI would have checked us harder. In retrospect, it would have been a mistake. Security correctly evaluated and monitored our party. Table service was excellent, bartenders were on point. Front of the house, immaculate. \nI hope XS monitors YELP, cause I tip my hat to you. I witnessed 2 walkouts, caught well before they got critical. On point staff, clean bathroom, attentive & unobtrusive service, (rare). \nQualifiers: It was slow, (for them) maybe 1500 on the click, the whole pool area wasn't open. But I sense they can scale their efforts.Great party. High percentage of crowd having big fun.\nI teach security. From what I saw,your crew don't need lessons,kudos!\nI don't go to mega clubs, I work them. But if I have too, this is the spot."
0,"Nice location west of Arcadia. That's about the best I can say. We were a party of 4 for dinner on a Sunday night. Restaurant was about half full. We received water shortly after we sat, then waited 10-15 minutes for a server to come to the table and only after we flagged her down. We were hungry and ordered a bottle of wine, salads and main course all at the same time. It took about 30 minutes to get the wine and 40 minutes for the salads (despite multiple requests for a status on our salads). We asked to speak to a manager, and that took another 10-15 minutes. When he did stop by our table, he asked if he could pour some more wine (no thank you, we were pouring our own and were fine), then he walked away. Completely disinterested. Our main courses came about 10 minutes later. Two of us ordered the flat iron steak - one ordered medium and the other medium well. Both came on the \""well\"" side of medium well. Another in our party had the pork special, which was very good. The chicken ordered by our fourth was unremarkable. If I were rating this solely on service alone, it would barely be one star. The rating at two stars is for a nice location and decent (but unremarkable) food.\nI will not be back."
0,"Shufflin' ova to Ova Easy in Phoenix I was hungry going in, but left da place still hungry.  Ordered the corned beef hash with eggs.  It's better than the canned corn beef hash, but with the same consistency.  The corned beef is grounded up for the hash, I prefer it shredded (with larger beef pieces).  Definately had better corned beef.  Nothing special about the broiche either.  They don't have any eggs benedicts either, if you like that.  Minus 1 star for small portions, minus 1 star for dollar value, minus 1 star for nothing too creative or tasty about the food.  Service is okay.  Party rock is to have a good time, but this place left me losing my mind.  For breakfast, go to a Black Bear Restaurant if you're near one.  It's a much better value for breakfast."
0,"I'm sure ihop used to have great food in the beginning. Now that they are large, they quality of food is cheap and everything is from a can. Batter from a box pancakes always taste good and exactly the same. Friend ordered an omelet.  It was soggy and there was a suspicious looking liquid in the middle which I though was raw egg. Turned out it was some kind of cheese product from a can. The server im sure was nice enough, but you couldn't understand a word she said.  In fact the entire staff you could tell was hired for cheap labor.  Cmon ihop, get you game together!"
0,"There's several places I could start this review. Perhaps its with Favorit's dimly-lit air of cool sophistication replete with its sumptuous leather-boothed seating and artisan interior. Maybe its the darkly accentuated wooden bar framed by shelf-upon-shelf of mainland europe's most stylish and luxurious designer lagers. Lagers that are both ready and exorbitantly priced to extract the unwary from they're hard-earnt cash in exchange for Favorit's false-promise of a cafe society usually only reserved for our more enlightened continental cousins. Special mention must also be made for the surly petulance and latino arrogance delivered with a studied sneer by the slick-haired Manager. An aloofness that leads the unsuspecting punter to wonder if this is born from the knowledge of the unparalleled excellence over which he presides. If anything, and you'll find this later, it merely serves to mask the thinly-veiled disregard for the very people that keep him in business - YOU - the customer. You see, if you're promised quality, as the prices Favorit charge suggest that you are, and you don't get the service you think you're paying for, you're going to feel just a little bit pissed off...that's just fact.\n\nSo, the place I'd really like to begin is with the food. And whilst we weren't expecting anything so lavish as say, a Consomm\u00e9 of Pheasant with truffle wonton, fine herbs and enoki mushrooms, or Seared Jumbo Scallops on a fluffed bed of potato with caviar and smoked tomato mousse. What we really weren't expecting however, was two plates of half-inch thick bright orange 'slick' masquerading as melted cheese, masquerading as lasagne. Imagine our slack-jawed astonishment when, after a cursory prod with the fork revealed nothing more than a limp patchwork of anaemic pasta bereft as it was of all other key lasagne ingredients. 'Cheesy Pasta' would have been a more apt description - a pasta which, for all the world, when coupled with the cooled orange day-glow swamp of cheese somehow contrived to look less like food, and more like the badly healed remains of a burn victim's face. Infact, stick it on a balloon with painted passata features and a more passable Simon Weston* effigy would be harder to find. I'd urge you all to try it if it didn't mean going there.\n\nSkirting past the accompanying handful of potato wedges (cold), and the side salad (the best thing on the plate). It strikes me that, in this day and age, in towns and cities throughout the UK where the high streets are awash with standardised, homogenised chains - you look to your independents to offer something a little bit different. A level of quality and excellence, coupled with an assured personal touch that you just can't find, and much less expect at your local Wetherspoons or Pizzahut. And above all, you don't mind paying the price for it.\n\nSo its with these values foremost in mind that you turn to places like Favorit because you're led to believe that they're a little unique and a little bit special. And whilst you'll turn a blind eye to a mixed up drinks order, or a prolonged wait - its much less the case when you're paying through the nose to have your intelligence insulted by the service of substandard food. Food for which far meatier examples exist at the bottom of your local supermarket's freezer section, ultimately means, at least where these over-preened mafio-so-piss-poor goons are concerned - you'd be far more likely to find a severed horses head on your pillow than satisfaction from Favorit's food.\n\nA final thought, if you're reading this review and you've never been. Rest-assured, I have, so you don't have to.\n\n*Sorry Si, its nowt personal..."
0,"We called TNP to replace two gates in our yard. Jimmy showed up on time, and the work was done quickly. He made gates very similar to a photo I chose off the internet, and they were installed very quickly. That's where the positive experience ended. Our front gate is hung crooked. When my husband pointed this out to him, he stated that it's because the wall that it attaches to isn't level. That may be the case, but being as we aren't the experts, I'd prefer to have the expert point that out to us while doing the work, rather than us discover it and feel like something is being hidden from us.\nThe back gate was obviously not measured for properly, and there is a 5.5\"" gap between the ground and the bottom gate. Our two small dogs can easily squeeze under this gap so now we have some lovely bricks underneath our brand new gate to keep that from happening. To pay a good amount of money for 2 gates that aren't secure now and aren't level is SUCH a waste of money. We asked him to come out to fix at least the back gate, which instead of him remeasuring and making a correct-sized gate meant cutting the frame and moving the gate down (not my idea of making the job right), but he never showed up on the scheduled day. Didn't call either. It's very disappointing that most contractors don't put pride into their work, and seem to get away with taking your money for a shoddy job."
1,"I created a problem for myself when I did my own taxes last year, but I went into iQTAXX today and Brenda and Lizeth solved my problem and were great to work with!  Their charge for services was very reasonable and I was a happy camper when I left!  Thanks Brenda, Lizeth and iQTAXX!"
0,"Some of the staff is wonderful! But there is one who has no customer services skills. I asked for a bloody mary, which he refused to make because he was \""busy\"" (there weren't many people in the bar). He overcharged for my drinks. He handled me being angry about this so poorly. I've never had such bad service, to the point of calling in to complain...  He just had a bad attitude and was overall a poor bartender. \n\nAlso, the sign says 3 doller well drinks, but apparently on weekends, they're 5. They don't tell you that til you close your tab and see your receipt. The sign says \""nightly\"" not weeknights.\nI usually like this place alright, when I'm just there for karaoke. But the bar side needs work. Like, new staff work."
1,"I'm probably not the best person to write a review of a Sports Book because I'm not a sports bettor, but I've been here with lots of folks and they seem to love it. The set-up is super nice and it's a great place to watch the races or games. You can also take a seat on one of the counter stools at the adjacent Vig Deli and eat while you watch."
1,"This is a great sports bar in north scottsdale.  No 'snottsdale' folks here.\nSaturdays they have specials on their burgers, which are delicious.  They also have Taco Tuesdays, with discounted tacos.  Their menu has the usual mexican favorites and some good appetizers.  A good sports bar for the whole family to enjoy."
0,"Friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked, skanky and old.\n\nI had two girls with me and so we needed extra towels but the housekeeper in the hall told me \""I need a towel from you to give you a towel but anyway we don't have any extra so I can't help you.\"" So I walked down to the fitness center and grabbed two towels and the housekeeper looked at me and I looked back at her and i just squeezed by lol.\n\nFunny another reviewer mentioned a flying beetle in the room, we had one of those, too! I got rid of it myself, though lol.\n\nAlso, they have the bistro setup, I just don't like those at all. To get coffee, you have to buy it from the 'bistro' instead of the free coffee setup Courtyard used to have. \n\nFor those of us that are Marriott-loyal, I think the Fairfield Inns are better value. They are just as comfortable, the beds and pillows are just as good- which is really all we care about- breakfast is free, and they tend to be newer."
1,"Great place to study. It's an indie coffee shop which is a nice change from Starbucks/Panera. Drinks are really good, priced about the same as Starbucks. Daily specials are on the cheap side. Food and pastries are good but a little overpriced. Definitely one of my favorite places in Champaign."
1,"Small but enjoyable museum that's perfect for a fun afternoon with the kids. The 'Miracle on the Hudson' exhibit is the centerpiece, but our little ones also enjoyed being able to climb into the cockpit of a Vietnam-era fighter jet and other cool planes. You can go through the whole place in about 90 minutes, and then head over to the nearby runway overlook at Charlotte-Douglas Airport to watch the planes take off and land. Our kids loved it!"

0,"The terrace is cool, but the service was terrible. \n\nWaitress was curt (borderline rude). We asked what beers they had, she stared blankly and listed a few styles. We chose IPA, but who knows from where. The second beer I ordered, she just never brought. And I don't think it was because we were Americans--two french-speaking UQAM students sat down at the next table and left after 20 minutes of no service.\n\nThis was the first place we went after driving in from Toronto (since we were staying at the lovely Angelica Blue B&B down the street) and we were worried this was how Montreal was going to treat our freedom-loving these-colors-don't-run boy-howdy American selves. Thankfully, this was not the case--we were respectful and friendly to every other establishment and were treated with absolute graciousness. Not here, though.\n\nNeat spot, but get your act together."
0,"This place is the worst for loans. It took four times for them to get my auto loan correct. Of course its always someone elses fault too, I never really got a straight answer as to why I had to come back 4 times to close the loan...

They were cold but the cheese was burnt. WTF?? The chips were stale and overly disgusting. Needless to say, I told the \""waitress\"" that I just could NOT eat them and she took them off my bill. I wound up paying about 4 bucks for a glass of coke. -_- And to top it all off, the customer service was non-existent. Never AGAIN. Save yourself the horrible experience and just visit the express Pizza Hut or Burger King across the way. BLAH!!"
1,"Always been a favorite bar for my boyfriend & I . The vibe here is what I really look for in a bar- easy, no problems. The patio that wraps around the whole old house is really neat & really cool pond.\n\nCold beer & oysters is what I come in for- every time great. Bartenders are really nice & chill . They are attentive & hold good polite convos. \n\nOnly think that bummers me out is I am not closer to the location !"
0,"The price range is reasonable; Damon's charged about the same for a rack of ribs, and they're a sports bar.  If you're complaining on the price, you're looking for a ribs joint in the ghetto, which this certainly isn't.  The price is high (sides are separate), but not ludicrous.   The appetizers were spot-on; beans, cornbread, mac & cheese, coleslaw; these are all perfect.\n\n\nBut the ribs and fried chicken we had were bad.  The most expensive things on our bill weren't good; the main courses weren't any good. \n\n\n It took about twenty minutes for our food to come out, which is a bad sign at a BBQ joint; usually, the food is cooked for hours, but they should be able to serve it up quick at that point.\n\nMy girlfriend had half a fried chicken, and we debated sending it back when it hit the table.  It had been in the fryer waaaay too long, and the outside of everything was burned.  It looked burned and blackened. It tasted burned.  Ugh.\n\nIn my case, I had a rack of ribs.  It was undersmoked; they weren't slow-cooked all the way through.  To make up for that, it looked like they'd grilled the hell out of it for those twenty minutes, and burned all of the outside of the ribs.  Edible, but not delicious.\n\nThe wait staff we worked with seemed very new at this.  They were perfectly fine waitstaff for a ribs place, but to make it upscale - and sell $10+ drinks! - the wait staff needs a bit more practice and polish.\n\nHaving a coat rack or coat hook or some place to put a coat in winter was also a strangely missing touch.\n\n\nOn the plus side, all of that is fixable, and I'll head back in six months to a year, but man, there are some bugs to work out here."
0,"When Pink Pony re-opened after its complete renovation, I loved it.  My roommate and I routinely had lunch, dinner, and happy hour at the place.  The chef was incredible and the ingredients were top notch.  The price point was very reasonable for the quality, particularly for lunch and happy hour.\n\nI had been traveling for work a lot, so a few months went by without going to the Pink Pony. Unfortunately, I went back last week, and they have a new chef with a new \""take\"" on the menu.  It's awful - the new burger, which they call their take on the \""Big Mac,\"" is horrible...  I would've preferred to eat at McDonalds.  Somehow the french fries were inedible, which is nearly impossible to do with french fries.\n\nI'm guessing the owner wanted to cut costs so he fired a great chef and replaced him with a mediocre chef buying garbage ingredients at huge margins.  Very depressing -- it was a great spot."
1,"My first time here. Csme here because of yelp comments and I was not disappointed.  It's a no frills place located in a strip mall. It is clean and the service was fine. I got there a little before noon and shortly after noon there were no tables available. Lots of Asian folk eating there.\nLots os choices on menu. I had one of the pho's and a couple spring rolls. Pho broth excellent and everything else was delicious, right down to the fresh sliced jalape\u00f1os. I will definitely go back."
1,It was a pleasure dealing with Banner Plus. They were very quick in processing my banner order and it looked great! There prices are very reasonable compared to other banner companies. I would use them again without a doubt!
1,"This place is amazing. Timothy (Timo as he's known) took care of me. Walking in, I thought I had stopped into Central District in Seattle. Loud hard core gangsta music, guys yelling back and fourth, cranking jokes, seeming oblivious that I was there.\n\nAs we walked in, one barber called to us asking what we needed. Told him we needed a haircut. We sat and as others came and went, seeming mostly to visit, we waited. One customer leaving said, 'the wait's long, but it's worth it'. \n\nMy partner was sat first, then I was next. The guy who took care of me has been cutting hair for 23 years. He was great! Cleaned up my beard, cut my hair, made it all look tight. According to him, I was representing his work. \n\nWithout a doubt the prices were great! I had the \""Cut Above the Rest Experience\"". It was worth every penny. \n\nThis place is a hidden treasure. For the best shave, cut, fade, trim, or whatever this place is not worth missing. In Vegas, you'll pay 3x's more for worse unless you come here.\n\nThanks Timo! Love what you did!"
0,I usually LOVE Boardhouse and I loved it when it was next to UNLV.  This new location is AWFUL!  There was no where for us to sit so we were told we could sit at some slot machines.  My sandwich was pretty disgusting compared to the other locations and the whole visit just sucked.  \n\nI also caught one of the employees making fun of me and called him out.  He just started laughing.  \n\nI'll stick to the good location off Lake Mead and Boulder Highway when I'm out in the area.
1,"I came in for a contact lens fitting.  I came out a happy patient.  \n\nI had expected to walk in and be greeted with, \""Hi.  Sign in.  Sit down.  Wait.  The doctor will be with you.\"" In and out. No personality.   \n\nNope!  I must admit I was taken by surprise when I was greeted with a warm smile and an associate led me to the back to sign in and fill out some paperwork. After some chit-chat with the associate, Dr.  Tran appeared shortly after and took me in for my eye exam.\n\nWhat set Dr. Tran apart from optometrists I had seen before was her personality and her genuine willingness to explain and educate me through every step of my eye exam.  This definitely put me in a comfortable position and gave me confidence to be in her care.  Dr. Tran was very personable and offered me advice when it came to purchasing contact lenses and brands she would personally recommend.  I was her last appointment of the day, yet she took so much time to answer any questions I had.  Much appreciated.  \n\nThe staff were exceptional and very helpful.  My overalll experience was pretty damn awesome.  \n\nYou had me at hello."
0,"1 star is more than this place deserves.  It's a complete joke in there. \n\n9 21 year old girls on New Years, and we wanted a place that wasn't too expensive, but had an open bar.  Unfortunately, that was I-Bar. The reviews weren't bad and the description and video tour made it out to be an actual club in the Rio. We were with our best friends, in Vegas, at a club.  How bad could it be?  So, $140 later, we had tickets for New Years. \n\nThen we got there... and let me tell you...it was BAD. The 'club' is merely a raised platform bar in the middle of the casino.  It smelled like cigarettes and we were the youngest people there by 30 years.  There was no room to stand and we weren't allowed to sit down because we hadn't purchased a 'table' (why anyone would purchase a table there is beyond me). Then we found out other people had walked in for free. Cool.  \n\nThe fact that they make this place out to be something is not, and charged us anything to get in, is what the real problem is.  Don't be fooled people...its a bar smack in the middle of a casino.  It ruined my New Years and i hope you never have to experience what I did at I-Bar.\n\nI do, however, suggest checking it out if you want a good laugh.  Just picture 9 hot 21 years old girls, decked out for New Years, in the bar and you'll guaranteed get a good chuckle."
0,Menu sounded great burgers just cooked wrong. Manager had a bad attitude.
1,"The Yelp reviews are right!  The food is very good and quickly prepared.  I've had Chinese take out in 15 different states and just came from the San Francisco Bay area, China Chef is one of the best I've had.  I ordered Crab Rangoon, steamed dumplings, and chicken lo mein.  All were excellent!"
1,"Oh, Rossi's! The guy who answers the phone has a silky radio DJ voice. I just want to listen to that guy talk, but then he's asking me whether I want slices or squares, so. Anyway, the pizza. It's pretty damn good. Basic, thin crust, comes in crazy huge sizes if you want a crazy huge pizza. The inside of the place is like stepping back in time 30 years. It seriously feels like 1984 in there (the actual year, not the book)."
1,Cool experience.  This place is good for dates.  Nice ambiance and the food is pretty good.  The portions are tiny though so be prepared to have a fat bill from ordering multiple items.  Tried salmon skin hand roll here for the first time and I've been hooked ever since.
0,"Found a worm when I ordered beef and broccolli. When I showed it to the server and told her that I wanted the pork chops instead, she wanted me to pay extra. I took photo of it. Not going back there anymore."
0,"Service in the drive-thru was fast, but apparently these workers all speak limited English and cannot get the order right.  I asked for a 2-pc cinnabon meal. I got and paid for a 1-pc meal. Didnt notice until after we drove away,  because it was in a box and who pulls their stuff out while they are driving?"
1,"Fantastic bar! Everything from the ambiance to the drinks to the service is top notch. Plus, the rooftop bar/lounge is pretty amazing. My wife and I went in for a few cocktails one night and absolutely fell in love with the place. We will be back MANY times."
1,"Hands down, the BEST hotel I have stayed in in Vegas. Possibly anywhere. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.\n\nFirst, the only parking is complimentary valet parking. Which is awesome. And makes you feel pretty legit, especially when you're not swanky enough to usually valet park your car. \n\nThe girl that checked us in was very nice and very helpful. She made light conversation with us and was very polite. All of the staff that we came in contact with were the same way. And I really appreciated when we came in late one night, that they were checking everyone's room keys before they could get on the elevators. \n\nThe hotel lobby was beautiful and well-kept. I really appreciated that there wasn't a casino attached because it made everything look that much classier and nicer. \n\nWe just got the standard room but it was HUGE. King-sized bed, more closets than I have in my house, a kitchenette with a sink, mini-fridge, toaster, etc., and a sitting area with a couch and two chairs. And the BATHROOM. I have never in my life seen a bigger hotel room bathroom. A shower that could have easily fit ten people, a walled off area for the toilet, double sinks, a HUGE jetted tub, and a TV IN THE MIRROR. I felt like a queen. \n\nThe only problem we had was the reception on the TV. About every three minutes, the picture would freeze and would stay that way for another minute or two. But when you're in Vegas, you don't spend much time laying around watching TV, so it wasn't a huge deal. \n\nI fully plan on returning to this hotel whenever I'm in Vegas. And I HIGHLY recommend staying here."
1,"Tried out Pop Up Pizza last night for dinner and LOVED it! Great flavor. Crust has a great crunch. Overall enjoyed the taste, atmosphere and people were very cool. \nI will be a regular at this place for sure."
1,"Wonderful restaurant. Waiters are attentive and kind. Yes, it is pricey but they provide you with a fun time and great food. \n\nI have been a few times, every time ive been it has been busy. The waiters are always ontop of their orders. Last time I went it was crazy busy so the service was slow, but the waitress kept appologizing for the delay. The owner is engaging with the patrons and makes you want to come back. \n\nGreat restaurant for a special night out!"
1,"When I go to Vegas, I am there to visit family and enjoy some gambling and food.  I stay and play like a local, so I prefer to spend my time and money Downtown.  The Strip is great for tourists, people who like to party and families with kids, but I am none of those, so I don't miss the glitz and glamour of The Strip.\n\nMy favorite upscale restaurant to eat at (and I eat there at least once every visit) is Second Street Grill inside The Fremont Hotel.  It is a Pan-Asian steakhouse with lots of great seafood and steak.  It is a little hard for wheelchairs to get in and out, but they will work with you to make sure everyone is comfortable.  The ambience is classy with low-lighting and the casino noise is pretty much nil (until someone opens the door and even then it's not bad).  The service is usually great (They have occasional slammed-busy nights) and the busboys, waitstaff and hostesses do a great job.\n\nI love the food here - not only is the presentation nice, but the choices are varied and quality is excellent.  There are a few dishes that I have not liked as much as others, but that happens and it's subjective.\n\nAppetizers are big and can be shared between 2 people - I highly suggest the caprese salad ((Fresh tomato slices, chopped basil, balsamic vinegar and beautiful fresh mozzarella cheese) , the soft-shell crabs (Crispy and tender and so flavorful!),  the Peking duck tacos (A little messy, but so yummy!) or the sashimi (Super fresh and delicious).  The shrimp cocktail is also really good with gigantic tiger prawns cooked to tenderness (not rubbery and over-cooked) served with a really good cocktail sauce.\n\nFor entrees, the steaks are always good - the filet mignon is tender and flavorful and the New York and Ribeye steaks are big and meaty.  The pork is thick and juicy and the whole fish is really tender and a great presentation.  The only entree I have had where I was disappointed has been the Tempura -- The batter was thick and heavy and I didn't care for it.\n\nOne of my favorite entrees is the lobster tail.  The lobster tails are HUGE - I am talking the meat, out of the shell is gigantic.  Not only is the lobster huge, it tastes great and they will remove it from the shell for you if you ask them to.  The drawn butter is served over a candle to stay warm and melted throughout the meal.\n\nThe desserts here are really good.  They have changed them recently, so the creme brulee is no longer available, but the ice cream is always good!\n\nThis place is not cheap, but it is completely worth the money to get away from the noise of Las Vegas and enjoy an intimate and fabulous meal.  Most people shun the Downtown areas as being low-rent and where losers and old folks hang out.  What they don't know is their loss - in my opinion, the gambling is better Downtown and with Second Street Grill tucked away in the Fremont, the food is great."
0,"Another place I thought I write/wrote an extended review but then, poof ! Nowhere to be seen then I get a little note from yelp saying, hey, you took some pics, how about writing a review.\n\nWell, I am frustrated by the lost lengthy review so I will keep this one brief.  \n\nWent in for late lunch with the gf.  Mistaken impression that hibachi meant it was bbq'ing meats on a lil hibachi either self serve or cooked to order.  Told it was basically teppan style AND not available until evening.   Not happy.  Went ahead and ordered some sushi, soup and a few other unremarkable items.  Nothing stood out for either of us.\n\nNo plans to return \n\npics posted ages ago"
0,"Had the steak and cheese, it was ok, not worth the money.\n\nStaff was very friendly, place was clean but the food was mediocre."
0,The smoothie I had today was not wonderful. And the staff did a great job of disrespecting me. I am very unhappy with the way I was treated.
1,"carne asada fries! fully loaded nachos! the grande breakfast burrito! these are the awesome things we get and split between myself, the husband, and a 3 and 1 year old. it's more than enough food to satisfy all of our appetites as well as any mexican food craving. i totally dig the salsa as well. it's nice to go somewhere and feed an entire family for around $10...and that includes a delicious horchata."
1,"Being that I usually stay at Monte Carlo, I sure am glad this little spot is just downstairs.  Just a few steps before hitting the strip, it makes your day so much better! I don't need to wander off in search of any other coffee shop aside from Sambalatte. The inside of the place is cozy, clean and has plenty of seats available (inside and outside). It for sure is a quiet coffee shop that can give you a few minutes of joy before going off to gamble or shop (free Wifi too!). The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable of their coffees, they do happen to have a lot of different beans from around the world. And their coffees is also very delicious. I love the fact that it wasn't drowned in syrups and sugars. I like my strong and bold coffee to have a coffee taste. The espresso was simply one of the best I've had. They also have teas and smoothies and a few pastries available."
0,"Okay let's start with the complimentary biscuits they give after taking your order. They were dry, over baked, but a pretty good flavor. I have fried shrimp dinner with crab cake and a lobster tail! HORRIBLE! The lobster was cooked too long, shrimp had an after taste like they were fried in oil that need to be changed out. The crab cake had TOO Much breading and not very flavorful.\nI will Not eat at this restaurant again. \nOh and the lemonade is so tart that we had to mix with water just to drink it....SOOOO from the drinks, dinner and biscuits, dinner was horrible! Only decent thing there was the salad....I could've gone to Wendy's for a Great salad and spent way less than $50!"
0,"Service was fine. Ok selection. Didn't have my size in the first couple shirts I wanted (Lrg). The shirt I did buy, grafic came of a little and faded first wash."
1,"I am not the type to \""Yelp\"" often, but I had to this time.  I came here for a facial, and was booked with Feri.  She was super sweet from the get go, and made me feel comfortable.  She asked me questions about my skin, skin treatment and what products I used - i could tell she knew her stuff!  Her hands did MAGIC!  I left there feeling not only pampered, but really feeling as though she made my skin glow - and it was!  I got so many compliments after and already 3 of my friends have gone to her and feel the same way.  She really went above and beyond and I couldn't help but share my secret with everyone - FERI DOES WONDERS!  She also does waxing, and does a quick and painless job...I highly recommend her!"
0,"\""They have mashed potatoes!!!\"" exclaimed a child to his grandparents as if it were Christmas morning.  I couldn't help but laugh.  Just a couple of minutes before that, my wife and I had our photo taken with a 5 foot spoon and fork that the resident buffet photographer then tried to sell to us for $25 during dinner. \n\nI had a couple of comps for the \""Buffet of Buffets\"" that were about to expire.  Even though we pretty much only do buffets when friends and family visit, we could not let these babies expire without using them.  The line for Paris and Planet Hollywood's buffets were over an hour long when I called so we ended up here.  No line!  No surprise.  \n\nWe were last here 5 years ago and not much has changed.  The most significant thing was that they got rid of their chocolate fountain and now give out bags of cotton candy.  The best things were the crab legs which were larger and tastier than the ones at the Rio we had a day later.  I also liked the carving station and the dessert area so we mainly just filled up on those.  The salad, Mexican and Asian stations were all mixed bags.  I heard the mashed potatoes were great....\n\nA family of 5 sitting next to us were already on dessert and as we were about to leave, the father got up to speak to the manager to complain about the pasta being cold.  He said it ruined their dinner so the manager fully refunded them!  They were already on dessert!!!  So for cheapos looking to take a shot, I guess you have a mark here."
0,"Packed like a can of sardines...smelled fishy too..*scratches head*\n\nOverpacked, much older crowd it seemed (even the go-go dancers), and a bunch of smokers blowing way too much smoke (pet peeve) = Not my cup of tea.\n\nWeaved our way in...danced a little in what seemed to have an open spot to maneuver...OH MY GAWD..it took forever walking from the entrance to the bar and to the mini dancefloor..only to find ourselves walking back out since it was way too damn packed. We were a group of nine girls and we held each other's hands, hoping not to lose anyone in the crowd.\n\nAlthough we got in for free, it seemed like everyone else did as well. I don't mind paying cover if it means I get a little bit of breathing room ya know. I was literally inhaling smoke left and right @ the bar. Not a pleasant first time experience. =(\n\nOn the upside, I did like the music they played (early 90s hip hop). It brought back a lot of high school memories. JET certainly does not compare to the beautiful Club XS!!! We missed XS so much we were aching to go back..and so we did!\n\nSorry JET..I was not a happy camper *thumbs down*..Better luck next time, that is if there is a next time."
1,Lovely place to sit down for some coffee with a tart. The lemon tart is to die for. I've heard the lunch is pretty decent as well. The service is pretty good as well.
1,"It's been two years since the Hill Group (Doug, Kirstin and Joshua) put us in our new home and we couldn't be happier.  They were great to work with, always accommodating and they provided all the info we needed to make a good decision.  We really enjoyed working with them through the entire process."
0,Good food the creamy mermaids are awesome as long as you don't get the old man that's always drunk and if he's sober he's incredibly rude will ignore you and plan to wait a long time to eat if he's your sushi chef. He's a nightmare not a nice guy but the waitresses were pleasant. Just a shame you have to deal with him.
0,"We had an ahi burger - zero taste compared to other local Ahi Burgers, server never heard of wasabi mayo and they did not carry.  Also had the Kobe burger- nothing special to pay 15-20 on.  I'm all for paying extra but if the food doesn't deliver, well then-"
0,"There's another review here which describes Saffron's interior as being more like a banquet hall than an Indian restaurant and I have to concur completely. When we arrived at around 8PM on a Saturday the large rectangular building was empty with the exception of two other pairs of customers at the round tables in the main part of the room. Down one side there are four half-booths, although only two of these appear to be available for customers, with one having a computer set up upon it and the other, outfitted with a pair of mismatched, padded office chairs appears to be used as a hangout for the proprietor's children when they aren't helping out with the restaurant.\n\nAfter being instructed by a small child to \""just sit anywhere\"" we took one of the open booths and another child brought us our menus. The covers looked slightly grubby, like they could have used a wipe down and I noticed a large stain on the side of the booth next door to ours - it looked like someone had spilled a large glass of coke over the side of the table at one point and that it had been allowed to set before washing. Chairs and tables were covered with plastic to ward off such spillages and the plastic on top of our table felt like it could have been a little cleaner also, as could the salt and pepper shakers which felt a little grimy when we moved them.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit odd and has a little raised section in the corner opposite the door and the 1970s disco ball in the middle of the room. The disco ball was just a mystery and I expected to see the four children from The Chronicles of Narnia file in and take their places in the four throne-like armchairs upon the curious dais at any moment. It was an unusual atmosphere.\n\nAfter a few minutes our host arrived with a jug of room temperature water with shrink wrap covering the top. He had collected this from one of the central tables which was home to a collection of such jugs. He seemed very friendly, however, and quickly accepted our restaurant.com certificate and enthusiastically took our order. In order to meet the $35 requirement we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, and a selection of Naan (two garlic, one sesame).\n\nOur host then presented us with some pappadums and the usual chutneys of tamarind and mint. The mint chutney had a nice kick to it and although the tamarind had an uncharacteristically odd \""ketchupy taste\"" it mellowed into a pleasant aftertaste so it all worked out. We were cheerfully informed that we could ask for more pappadums if we liked and as the host departed I commented to my wife about how the friendliness and enthusiasm was enough to make me overlook some of the oddities of the place in my upcoming Yelp review.\n\nDespite the fact that there were very few others in the restaurant we didn't see any staff again for the forty or so minutes it took for our food to arrive. I wasn't bothered at all by the longer than average wait time and the food more than made up for it anyway. My Chicken Tikka Masala was a little milder than I am used to, however the very nutty and savoury Shahi Paneer was a perfect accompaniment. I found my garlic naan to be tasty without being amazing, but my wife found her sesame naan to be a little overcooked on the bottom. The Malai Kofta was somewhat different to other incarnations of this dish that I've experienced. The sauce tasted more like a onion/butter sauce than creamy, but was tasty, however the kofta themselves were dark, somewhat sharp in flavour and fell to pieces at the merest touch of an eating utensil. Overall though, the food was excellent and we couldn't wait to return and I expected to award the restaurant four stars with a disclaimer about the slightly odd vibe to the place and maybe a friendly suggestion that they wipe up a bit in my review.\n\nThis is where things took a turn for the worse. A medium sized party had entered the restaurant and placed their orders just as I was enjoying the last bites of sauce-dipped naan and they also appeared to have a couple of take-out customers. Our host asked me how everything was to our enthusiastic responses and disappeared into the kitchen.\n\nI got my credit card out and politely sat at the table waiting to deal with my bill. Twenty minutes later we were still waiting. Ten minutes later I asked a child if they could ask someone to help us with our bill. Twenty minutes passed and a surly woman came out, but it was to deal with a takeout customer. The child still clutched our bill and restaurant.com certificate. Finally, after about an hour of waiting we were finally dealt with and could get out of there, lamenting that we could have driven across town to our home TWICE in the time we waited to pay for our meal.\n\nThe food here is great, but being made to wait a full hour (no exaggeration) to pay, including 30 minutes after you TELL THEM you want to pay is just unacceptable, especially when there were at least three adult staff members and custom was slow."
0,"Our air went out, although it was replaced I was told by maintenance to prop up books or stuff to hold the drapes back from the vent part of the air conditioner. This just looks so ghetto. I shouldn't have to deal with stuff while on vacation. The worse part about it was that I e mailed a complaint and attached pictures of the lovely AC and have not heard back and when I called I was told the e mail was enough and was basically hung up on. And what's with all the dead crickets around the pool? Gross"
0,"Les 3 Brasseurs is a pretty average restaurant.  The food's alright, the service is alright, the beer's alright, the atmosphere is alright (as long as you don't mind the really loud volume).  It's too expensive and well-known for what it is, but I wouldn't call it bad."
1,Theaters are clean and we'll kept.  Staff are friendly.  Popcorn is marginal at best stale!
0,"We were really hoping this would be a great place.  It may be, but unfortunately, they forgot our order and we sat in a mostly empty restaurant for about 45 minutes wondering what happened to our sandwiches.  Ended up leaving hungry because we couldn't stay any longer.  They did credit us back for the entire meal, so that was good.  Maybe we'll try again??"
0,"I've come here for breakfast before and haven't had a problem with food in the past.  I'm not sure what happened tonight, but I will never come here for dinner again.  My two friends and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, a tuna melt, and a soup.  Keep in mind, I NEVER send back food.  Tonight was the exception.  The soup was cold, so they brought us another one, which was fine. But both sandwiches were cold, and the cheese wasn't even melted.  The server apologized and said they would make us new sandwiches.  A few minutes later they brought out a new sandwich-- except it wasn't new! They were the same sandwiches they brought a few minutes earlier-- with our bite marks in them.  They put partially eaten food back on the grill.  Health code violation, maybe?? The server was very apologetic when we pointed it out, and although our sandwiches didn't taste bad, she said she would bring out new ones.  The tuna melt came out fine, but my grilled cheese with bacon and jalape\u00f1o was terrible!! It was mostly raw jalape\u00f1o with a little bit of cheese.  I took a few bites and gave up.  This-- coming from a girl who is almost always in the clean plate club!  The only redeeming factors tonight were are apologetic server and the bottle of wine we ordered."
1,It's hard to find an AYCE sushi place that will do things the way you like. Loved everything we tried and the service was good! Definitely returning.
1,"This place has never disappointed me! I absolutely love sushi, and so far this place hits the spot. There are only a few sushi restaurants in Montreal that I am completely in love with and faithful to; Ginger is one of them. On the days/nights that I'm not in the mood for anything loud and busy, I'll just order for take out.\n\nMy absolute favourites on the menu: Spicy Lobster roll and Lobster salad\n\nThere were a few sushi rolls not included on the menu list that are worth ordering, inquire about them and give them a shot too! :)"
1,"If you haven't experienced Jimmy Johns  yet.... grab your car keys, your walking shoes, your bike, your bus pass, whatever you need to get there and experience the pure awesomeness that is JJ's.\n\nYeah, Yeah its just another sub shop right?  NO, the bread is amazing and baked fresh every day.   They even offer \""Free Smells\"" which is a way better smell than the Subway Stench you have stuck in your clothes for days after you walk in the door. \n\nJJ's uses fresh ingredients, amazing baked fresh daily bread and makes it \""So fast you'll freak\"" right there.  My sandwich is usually done by the time I'm don't paying for my order.  The sub names are fun too, who wouldn't want to order a Pepe, a Turkey Tom or the Gargantuan!  They have vegetarian options, low carb options (unwhich- but why you would get rid of the best part of the sandwich is beyond me) and will customize your order if you don't like the menu options.   JJ's also offers their \""day old loafs\"" for pretty cheap (under $1) and is great for making garlic bread  or something at home.\n\nComing from the Midwest, JJ's was a staple and I was really disappointed when I first moved here to find that the valley was JJ free... luckily all good things from Michigan are slowly creeping over here, Jimmy Johns, Bell's beer and next we might just see Coney Island's popping up."
0,"Meat is dry. I got the mushroom burger and it wasn't tasty. It lacked everything and didn't even have burger sauce. It was just meat, cheese and a few mushrooms slapped into a bun without any other condiments. Chili fries were dripping with grease, they serve them on a cardboard plate so it could absorb the grease but they were drenched in red grease from the chili. Sweet potato fries not good enough, they're better at El Pollo Loco. My husband got the baja burger and he said it wasn't good either. It is way over priced for nasty food. Please don't compare to In n Out, not on the same page at all!!! The pictures are deceiving cause they look good but arent good at all."
0,"Deceptive contracts. When you ask the sales people to clarify terms in the contract, they will make up lies. It's a shame that such a nice facility (initially) has gone downhill so fast.\n\n1. I had to stop doing cardio there because they would dust, vacuum, and use a strong cleaner right next to me while on the treadmills. I have asthma and it made me have an asthma attack. This happened several times; see other review.\n\n2. Locker room is disgusting and dirty, especially on weekends. Water will puddle for days in the shower, along with wet towels, razors, and paper towels. Showers frequently broken.\n\n3. They do not stay open late enough (8pm) on weekends.\n\n4. They do not have enough bars so the all benches and the squat rack can be used at the same time. It's annoying when it gets busy.\n\n5. Parking is a disaster. The parking company likes to randomly open and not post the hours they are open. Want to grab food after a workout? Tough luck; your validation is good for only two hours, and it can't be validated by a restaurant and Gold's Gym. I thought CityScape wanted people to spend money there.\n\n6. Not once have I seen staff properly stack the weights. Trainers leave weights and other equipment everywhere.\n\n7. Creepy guys will be sitting in the chairs in the locker room watching people change for hours.\n\n8. Basically no one uses the overnight, for-charge lockers, and there aren't nearly enough regular lockers. Such a waste of space.\n\nI could go on and on. In central Phoenix, I would recommend other gyms ahead of this one, including Tangible, YouFit, and even LA Fitness on 20th St during non-peak hours. Don't waste your time and money. Staff is nice, and the gym looks neat, but it's a terrible place to sign a contact to use."
1,Absolutely the *best* Chinese food in the city! The sushi is amazing as well... we have always been treated well and had a great experience! Would recommend to anyone!
1,"I love this store! I have been shopping here since I was a kid in sports and now I get all the gear my kids need for their sports. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, but most of all, patient! They have an AMAZING custom apparel department that not only does most team sports in The Valley, but anything you can dream up; from a family reunion T-Shirt to a shirt for a Fun Run with the girls! Most important, I love that this place is family owned and local!  No sending my money off to some big board of directors!"
1,"We always visit Nora's when we come to Las Vegas. It is a nice alternative to something in the hotel and the food and service are always great. \n\nI opted for the \""Crazy Alfredo\"" on my last visit and it was decent. I still prefer their Vodka Penne over most of the pasta dishes there. The place has a decent selection of wines by the glass as well. \n\nThe antipasto salad is pretty good and plenty for two people to share as a starter."
1,This place is awesome and right across the street from NC Music Factory.  The food and service are outstanding.  Simple menu but great options....and breakfast all the time.  Love it
1,Delicious cupcakes! Right up there with the ones from Magnolia bakery in NYC. \nThe carrot one is moist and yummy. \nGot a mini one for my puppy and he loved it! Almost ate it whole in one bite!
1,"If you want to buy or lease a car I highly recommend Findlay Honda. The salesman Robert Rojas, sales manager Michael Wagner, and the finance manager Lisa Schaerrer are good and honest people who actually want to help you without ripping you off.  \nMary"
1,"I stopped in for a quick lunch this afternoon while wandering around South Side. It was quiet in there, just me and one other customer who left shortly after I came in. The service was very friendly and quick. It took me a while to decide what to order, as there were so many different combinations of hot dogs and toppings on the menu. I eventually settled on a hot dog with pulled pork on top. A couple of minutes later, I was provided with a hot dog piled high with sweet pulled pork and barbecue sauce. Yum! The hot dog itself was fine, nothing spectacular, though I think I recall it being an all beef hot dog though, which is less definitely sketchy than the alternative. The pulled pork on top was very good, and there was a generous amount of it! The hickory barbecue sauce on it was also a nice touch. Overall, very satisfying, reasonably priced, and quick. I was probably in and out in less than 15 minutes. I didn't try any of the sides, but there are a bunch, like fries, loaded fries, popcorn, etc. Definitely a good spot for a quick lunch!"
0,"The breakfast buffet / memorial brunch was all about quantity rather than quality, it was all very average buffet flavors and I didn't enjoy a single thing I tried. The omelet wasn't good, pancakes were average and everything that was precooked (except for the pastries) wasn't good at all (pizza, pasta etc). If you have any taste buds save your money as it was way to expensive for what is it, an average buffet. To make matters worse, the service was also below average with the waitress only coming to our table twice and the cutlery and cups smelt gross like eggs.\nI had a better meal the day before at a diner where the entire bill was cheaper than 1 person at the buffet."
1,"Great place for fun,food,drink and entertainment and the prices are reasonable. They provide a free shuttle service. Lots of TV's for all games even on Sunday NFL. Outside fire pit  when chilly outside with misters when it's hot. This is a sports bar not a fancy restaurant but the food is good and they always have specials on food and drink plus a reverse happy hour.Management keeps this place clean and neat with great help from staff and servers."
0,My boyfriend said the black beans had no flavor and tasted like they came out of a can and the spanish rice had the texture from being in some sort of heat source for too long. I did not like their red chili as it was somewhat bland.  The ambiance and service was good though.
0,"Sadly disappointing. The men are horrible dancers and for the sub par performance you could at least give the poor girls what they came to see...more skin, sans the white running shoes."
1,"Cosmo is by far my favourite hotel of all!! Sorry, other vegas hotels I've had a slight change of heart. \n\nWrap around suite is nice but, the penthouse we stayed in even better. Stayed here with my girlfriends last weekend and absolutely loved it!! Although, the amount of space is bigger than the condo I live in now, I can appreciate the amount of space and the blasting edm and cant forget my love for gangster rap all day and night playing. \nThe rooms are a good size all 3, with kitchen, dining and living room and enough tvs I won't miss out on any action, not that I watch much tv anyway. \n\nLocation is perfect. Hakasan then back to marquee and crawl back to our rooms. Perfect night huh? \n\nThank You for a great time Cosmo! See you Halloween weekend and possibly 30th birthday in 2 months?"
1,"Authentic Chinese from from different parts of China.  Not a long menu, but quite a few signature dishes.  Getting better and better."
1,"I went to Emerge for a gentler alternative to chiropractic manipulation for a reoccuring back problem. I not only found that, but also a more wholistic approach to general health which included specific herbs and multivitamins that Dana suggested. These have helped me to improve my overall health and quality of life.She has a professional approach and explained fully every step of her treatment and answered every question I had before the treatment started. Dana's friendly demeanor is immediately relaxing and her thoroughness is confidence inspiring."
1,"After seeing all the stellar reviews, I knew that J and I had to have our last meal in Vegas together at Raku (especially since we still had our rental car!). Unfortunately, because J's flight was at 8:45, we ended up rushing through our meal.\n\nSERVICE: FABULOUS. The staff was super accommodating, and took care of all our needs; they didn't even bat an eye when we asked them to rush our orders. 5 stars\n\nAMBIANCE: Good amount of lighting. Very cozy. I loved the extremely authentic vibe, and the fact that so many of the patrons were obvious regulars. \n\nFOOD: very good. We had:\n- Kurobuta pork cheek: probably the worst of the grilled items we ordered. For whatever reason, the meat was extremely chewy, to the point of being inedible in some cases.\n- Yellowtail: ooh so good. SO well prepared-- seared on the outside and slightly rare on the inside, extremely tender and delicious. My fave of the night\n- Homemade agedashi tofu: very unique, and when paired with ikura and the soy based broth... yum yum\n- Balsalmic glazed duck: good, but nothing to write home about\n- Beef tendon oden: extremely tender beef. I thought there would be more broth, but this was pretty tasty\n\nOVERALL: I would love to dine at Raku again... next time for a more leisurely meal. I reserve that 5th star for my visit in the future!"
1,"This place is amazing.  Had the pirate and shared a mimosa trio with my gf while her daughter had the monkey.  Great food, wonderful staff, and awesome environment.  \n\nI love this place."
1,Having a great dinner and time with family and friends during this holiday weekend.  Great atmosphere and great food.
0,"Macaroni ain't no good, taste like wood. I usually wait about a week or two to yelp but this place....is a scam.\n\nI can not believe that they just served me Van de Kamp shrimp and pre frozen catfish. Im upset, because I came to Vegas and wasted money and it wasnt on a slot machine. Jesus the mac and cheese, KRAFT MACARONI, really? \n\nDo yourself a favor and skip this place, no wonder my guest and I were the only people here. I choose to skip mentioning the Kroger brand hush puppies on purpose."
1,"Great food. Service was top notch and I can't believe this place isn't packed from wall to wall every second. Gnocchi was great, pizzas were on point. Chefs in the dining room making a couple table visits. Love to see that."
1,"Good value.\nFriendly staff.\nCourse is on the easier side, but I like it.\n\nDepending on your budget, this may be the most suitable option in town.  I would play again."
0,"$30 hookah, meh service...and it was completely dead when we went. The saving grace? Really great cocktails. Bottoms up!"
0,"Terrible.  Don't waste your money.  We spent $65 on the worst meal that we have ever had.  We ordered buffalo wings and they brought out their boneless version.  We did not ask for boneless.  Their boneless wings are made out of processed chicken nuggets!  Gross.  Then the pizza came out.  The outside was over cooked and the crust on the inside was undercooked.  The server commented on how bad the pizza looked, but did not offer to comp it.  My 5 boys thought the pizza was gross.  They love pizza and never turn it down.  My husband tasted it and said it was bad.  I do not recommend this place.  My order was wrong as well, but the server fixed it.  Sweet potato fries were good, but my burger was nasty.  We plan on NEVER returning."
0,"Horrible management, also being nickled and dimed for fees as we move out. They target certain residents and dismiss rules for others. Multiple things were broken when we first moved in and continued to fall apart. The only nice staff were maintenance.. probably because we were calling them so often we became friends. Rent elsewhere, the \""deals\"" are not worth it."
1,"Love this target. Never crowded, great location, always clean & huge selections. Also, Target's generic label \""Up & Up\"" Brand is the best! Love the \""Up & Up\"" laundry detergent versus Walmart's generic label of \""Great Value\"" brand. There is a difference & Target wins each time."
1,"First things first, The name of this place is Chef Guru G and not Chef Guru. It resembles a hole in the wall. This place doesn't even try to look fancy. I'd heard people raving about their curry poutine, So I wanted to try it out. There were around 6 people in this restaurant  havin the same thing. The CURRY POUTINE. It was spicy and delicious. A perfect amalgamation of  Quebecois & Pakistani cuisine.  So far one of the best poutine variations I've tried in the city. They take a while to prepare it. It gives me hope (or false hope) that they make it fresh.\n\nFood : Great\nService :Friendly / Slow\nAmbiance : Hole in the wall\nWorth the price : Yes"
1,"If you watch Mad Men, you notice that only upper crust, ubber wealthy people use to ride on airplanes.  It was a major luxury to be able to spend that much to get around.   Then coming back to the present time... it's still a luxury to be able to fly, however, it's more of a necessity now.  Especially, when driving to LV from SF takes way too long for my taste.  Plus, time is money!  \n\nI've traveled to and from Las Vegas many times and the service is always pretty good.  It's been on time, the lines move smoothly and efficiently, and the overhead compartments for my luggage is pretty easy to take care of.  I don't have any complaints.  And this time, we arrived 15 minutes early to LV, which is good because time is money, honey."
1,"Straight out Brooklyn, Mission District, or even Austin comes the preferred home of the Phoenix hipster.  A very solid menu, patio and ambiance.  Conversely the parking situation and service leave a little to be desired."
0,"I dont know where to even begin.  I didnt even make it into a room before i lost my patience and had to walk out.  When i first called to schedule my appointment everything seemed fine. Be there 15 mins early for paperwork, which is normal for a new patient.  Got there 15 mins early as asked and waited 15 mins just to get the paperwork. No greeting or welcome to our office. Small tiny waiting room. There was nowhere  for me to sit either. The place was packed with tons of people just sitting there waiting. There was kids running in and out of the back with no supervision, people yelling and blocking the door to get in and out of office. Very unprofessional place and it is run like a circus.\n\nAfter being there for over a hour waiting past my appointment time. The lady at desk said sorry it will be another 20-30 mins to get you in the X-ray room. Really? My appointment was at 2:00 pm and i would not get in a X-ray room till 3:30? What kind of ghetto place is this.  Every dentist i have been to in the past has capability of doing X-rays in every room they sit people. Finally after watching some 15 year old kid who was there with no parents or anything feeling up his girlfriend in the waiting room i decided enough was enough. I got up told the kid to have some respect and manners, told the lady the place was ran like a zoo and to cancel my appointment. I have never seen a dental office run so poorly. I do not recommend going here unless you need to kill 5 hours or something."
1,"Going there many times. The place is huge and clean. I love to go there especially not just to sing. But to drink, eat and have fun. They got surprisingly good food and desserts. Yogurt alcohol there is awesome very smooth and tasty :)"
0,"This place sucked. The waitress hit on my husband, took 20 minutes to get us water, then passed us off to another waiter who claimed she had to leave (she didn't - she was there well after we left). The food was mediocre at best and over-priced. The beer we ordered even came with ice floating on top of it instead of head. We definitely won't be returning here."
1,"My husband and I tried this place after looking for ideas on Yelp.  We were not disappointed.  Most all of the previous reviewers were spot on. Ellis Island casino and Brewery is small and dive-y in appearance and the location is not enticing. As you enter, you will notice the strong cigarette presence.  The restaurant is actually the 24/7 Cafe in the back corner.  The seating is done by a number system. My husband ordered the prime rib dinner which comes with soup or salad, choice of potato, green beans and a micro beer or root beer.  I ordered the grilled salmon.  Both meals were nicely done.   Our waitress seemed disinterested but efficient.  Another waiter brought out our meal, however, it was 2 meals of prime rib, which I suspect belonged to another table.  I explained to the waiter that one of the plates he brought out was what my husband ordered, so he left it on our table and returned the other to the kitchen. I had to wait an extra 5 minutes until my salmon entree came out.  But 4 minutes prior, the waiter brought another 2 plates of prime rib to the table behind us. \n\nBottom line, if looking for a restaurant with a large selection, decent taste and inexpensive, come to this place, but come early to avoid waiting too long."
0,Small place. Smaller than other places. The view is nice. They have big widows. Drinks are expensive (what else is new). The music---Sucked. They need a better DJ !! I have experienced better DJs at a clothing store. The songs that they played were whacked. It totally killed the vibe.
1,"Formerly known as Dancing Goat, this place used to be the place we'd go for free wireless internet access, a warm cup of coffee, and a slide of cake. It has a local feel(though I've been told they have branches all over the midwest). They're known for their tiramisu but I love their carrot cake and princess cake too. \n\nA perfect place for a group meeting or to work on your homework with friends. It opens as late as Hunt, but finding parking might be an impossible task. Come here once before you graduate."
0,"This is an outdated theater with all kinds of sketchiness going on.\n\nI've only seen one movie here, but a group of kids walked in late and then talked and laughed for the duration of the movie. No one from the theater walked in once, as they do in most theaters.\n\nIt's probably very possible to have a decent time here, but my experience was very poor. I do not recommend this theater. (I tried to reach out to the company to share my experience but the inquiries/complaints page was down and wouldn't accept submissions.)"
0,"This local restaurant really needs a decor update..dark, dank, smelled of fish and stale beer. Food was only so so..burger was VERY overcooked despite ordering it medium. The French fries were tasteless and greasy. Very slow to get drink refills. Will likely not return, would rather eat at home."
1,"I have a very entertaining experience at the Sushi Room that I will gladly tell while keeping names private (so as to not piss anyone off). Note that this is a whiiiiiileee back so I don't know if their staff is still the same. Phew\n\nSo my date and I show up really late on a Thursday night. The place is essentially empty except for a couple of people at the bar. We order a couple sake bombs, 2 rolls (spicy tuna and a salmon roll) and some korean-style ribs. The sushi was pretty tasty (very standard, nothing out of the world) but the ribs were pretty hard to eat with the chopsticks and had a bit of fat. Still, it was decent appetizers and HH pricing at night, so we were pretty complaisant with our choices. They had a couple choices of sake which I appreciated, so we went with the drier (less sweet) option. With HH prices, it ended up being about $25 for the both of us. Pretty darn good. \n\nHalfway through our meal we notice that we are the only ones left there and that the staff is busting up the volume (90's rap) and dancing to it. Don't get me wrong, it was freaking hilarious. Then, another staff member (not our actual server) invited my date and I next door to the Living room, where she proceeded to tell us her life stories and flirt with all the owners. (Sushi & Living Room are owned by the same group of people). Needless to say we had a great time, but it was all incredibly random. Their staff was fun. They kept it moderately professional while we were eating and enjoying our alone time... then let it all loose when their shift was over and we had paid our bill. Lol. What can I say, I love the restaurant life."
1,Thank goodness it is in the lobby of our hotel.  After a night of Christmas party dancing this place felt like just what I needed.  The service is tops and the atmosphere is very classy and elegant.  Our server immediately got our beverage orders and we were happily settled in our window side table.  Teas were good and were under the Fairmont brands.  How cool is that.  They do not do that anymore.  I had a the Eggs Benedict and my bestie had the omelette and we were both very happy with our meals.  I must say for my plate the potatoes and asparagus that accompanied it were cooked to perfection!  Usually the sides do not bowl me over but it totally did in this case.  \n\nBecause I was so hungover I craved a bit more food but something sweet to end the meal.  They had a great selection of desserts in the buffet that you can dig in for $8.50.  Not bad considering how delicious looking they all were!  French pastry...how can you go wrong.  Finally I decided I wanted a simple pain au Chocolat which was not on the menu.  As I sadly gave back my menu to our server I lamented that what I wanted was not on the menu.  He nicely asked what I craved and he said he will see what I can do. Within minutes...et voila!  Chocolate croissant!!!! Perfect!!! \n\nSo yes I will go back here for the brunch buffet and the tea and the great service!  How addictive that it is all under our hotel!\nPrices are higher but so worth it.
0,"Food was ok, nothing to tell my friends about. If your in the area come, but not a place to say, lets go eat at Bitz-ee."
0,"Sage has become our sushi place, that is until tonight.  We ordered 2 AYCE and one Deluxe Tempura Platter.  The sushi was not nearly as good as it has been in our past visits.  The rice was overly sticky.  A number of the rolls that we ordered were fair at best, not even considering the rice.  We had an assortment of leftover pieces from those rolls that weren't good - and they wanted to charge us .50 for each piece.  If it were good, it would have been eaten.  I let it be known that an added fee would be completely offset by the tip.  I was told they didn't care.  The owner, Mary, was very rude, and made a few whispered remarks.  When I questioned what she said, I was told \""nothing\"".  (There was no additional charge)  We had to wait a full 20 minutes to get the bill - and that included asking every server.  Another 10 minutes before someone would take the payment.  Our stamped card for a free dinner was almost filled up, but we ripped it up before we left.  Bummer!"
0,"The ride up to the top of VooDoo is long. Once you get to the top of the Rio, the view of Vegas is superb. We got there around 11 and we got in for free because we stayed at the Rio. The DJ stunk; he played garbage. Luckily, a new DJ hit the deck at 12 and spun some sick beats. +1 for the go-go dancers and +1 for the view. Vegas has nicer clubs/lounges."
0,"I stopped eating out at basic Italian places because... Heck I can fix most of these items better than they do!  This place is no exception. \nI only come here because my \""special\"" somebody (as in he is really special when it comes to his taste bud or the lack thereof) truly thinks this place has the best pizza. My dear yelper friends, read my lips, they do NOT have the best pizza.  Nothing here is memorable. To be fair, their food are edible and especially if you are hungry and you are stuck out that way (hence 2 stars)  \nTruth is their marinara sauce was tart. I had to work on it at the table in order for it to not taste like it came from a can. Meatballs were blend and a little tough. Pizza looked under-cooked. \nService was never great. I really think it is a waste of a restaurant because they obviously have a core support group in order for it to be still in business. So either all their regulars do not know what real and good Italian food taste like or... Sadly I can't think of another reason."
0,"I decided to check this place out to see what all the fuss was about.  Four reasons to not bother:\n\n1. Despite being in a strip mall at the intersection of two major roads and close by several upscale neighborhoods, the \""Palace\"" was completely empty at 12:30 on a weekday.  Never a good sign.  Guess this place doesn't do a lot of lunch business. \n\n2. I had the lamb kabobs which were dry and gamey like overcooked deer meat.  Meh.\n\n3. The decor leaves much to be desired, the food leaves much to be desired, and the service was slow and grumpy.  Did I wake them from their midafternoon siesta?  \n\n4. Even Olive Garden has more variety, more consistency, a more pleasant atmosphere and better value.  \n\nWith so many better options in Vegas, why would you come here?  Oh that's right.  No one does."
0,"We love Pita Jungle. We eat at the Chandler location 2-3 times a week. My husband is a nurse and we live in Gilbert so he gets off work around 8 or 8:30...we went to Pita Jungle in Gilbert and it was 8:45 and they told us they were closed. I said, that it says 9 at the door and the manager said, we don't serve anyone this close to closing. This was about 2.5 years ago I think...it was when they first opened. We will drive all the way to Chandler now. Occasionally we will eat at Pita Gilbert in a pinch but the service is terrible there and they will have you wait even when there are empty tables sitting there...they don't hustle at all to please the customer. Their portions are smaller too. Not that I need a huge portion but we like to share our food and having more chicken in a spicy chicken wrap rather than rice filler makes a huge difference to me. Mostly, I like the food for the most part but the service is, has been and continues to be aweful. I am pretty certain it comes from the management."
1,"I love this place, with all it's divey charm. They have first run movies, and instead of paying $10-$11 bucks per movie, you can pay $6.75 and see two. No more sneaking a bottle of popcorn and a snack into the theater in your purse; the drive-in employees could not care less. People bring pizza, coolers with beer, and basically have a picnic. Oh, you want popcorn? They've got that at the concession stand, along with all your other movie standards. The prices for snacks are actually pretty reasonable compared to the regular theater as well. \n\nMy friend and I like to pull out our camp chairs and park them in front of the car when the weather's nice, which appears to be a common thing to do. Lots of families show up to partake of the cheap movies, and kids hang out in their pajamas. It's actually a pretty good place to take the kiddies; they have a playground, kids can  get up and move a bit without anyone being bothered, they can talk without really disturbing anyone else, since you aren't all just on top of each other. \n\nThe only negatives: Not the best neighborhood in town, though the drivein itself seems perfectly fine. Next to a small airport. Helicopters flying overhead may occasionally make it hard to hear bits of your movie. It's a drivein, so although they have digital projection, it's still not necessarily the best picture.\n\nIn my opinion, it's worth going. It's good old fashioned fun for both adults and kids, and one of the best deals in Vegas."
0,"Pros: Really cool Soda machine. Very friendly people. \n\nCons: Have yet to get my order correct. Just one request, no caramelized onions."
1,"Best thai beef noodle soup!! Okay, I've really only tried the one here and then at thai style noodle house...but this one wins hands down!  Small hole in the wall restaurant with very friendly service staff.  The thai beef noodle soup has a richer beef broth with a more savory flavor than the thai style noodle house version.  It also comes with a generous portion of beef balls/beef slices/tendon/tripe.  There is also the option of different noodles (egg/wide noodle/etc).  If you are a pho lover...try this thai style version...you will not be disappointed!"
0,Very bad experience on 7-30-2014.  Took two interns for lunch at the Cafe Fiesta.  It was Senior Wednesday.  One third of tables occupied-30 minute wait.  Told it was the kitchen staff.  Computer system down and cannot use points-cash only.  Online menu many more items than sit down menu.  $28.00 for meal-no senior discount with points.  Was told that is the way it is and I wasn't the only one affected.  Last visit for me.
1,When I cost vegas I go from the airport strait to cvs. Get my booze pick up my sodas some extra products that I missed or didn't want to carry on the plane. My visit to this location was great. It's mainly self checkout so you don't have too many lines unless it's like rush hour and all kinds of people are getting water and what not.. \n\nThey have security sometimes so you will feel safe and be able to walk around with no worries .
0,"I've been coming to this Kobe Sushi Bistro for the last few months. Over the course of the last few weeks I've been noticing something funny. Now before I actually decide to say what that is I do want to go on record saying that the food is excellent and the service is mediocre at best. The thing I've been noticing though, is that every time we use a card to pay (still tipping 20% in cash), we always seem to see an extra charge on our card. I've contacted management and they didn't seem that interested. In short we paid for a $60 plus meal and was charged $80 on our credit card while still leaving them a decent sized tip. So after a few calls to our bank they've notified us of fraudulent charges coming from there. We were refunded the extra amount that was stolen, but this doesn't negate the fact that they made no attempt to fix this issue. They clearly have a leak in their system or a waiter/waitress that is charging extra to the cards. I won't be returning any time soon and I'm actually sad to say that to a place I've spent hundreds of dollars on."
0,"I have been using Ruby Ride for 4 months and in that time my service started out good and ending with to email of them no longer keeping me as a client.. \nAfter about 2 months I started running into issues with being picked up late,  making me late for my training session with my client.  In the past 6 weeks, I was not picked up for work and contact 3 managers of ruby ride and no one contacted me back..  Ever.. \nRuby Ride took funds out of my account with out my authorization 2 times in 6 weeks.. The last time they yet to refund my funds?  I had to call my bank and disrupt the charge. After telling then I wanted to change my plan and use anywhere card.. It got to the point I went out and bought a road bike to ride to work most the time..  7 mile one way.. I contact management in several occasions and if they did get back to me it was after 3 or 4 days.. \nThis service went down hill quick,  after letting go of some of there best drivers.. And increasing there rates on existing clients after they were dependent on ruby ride?..  Overall I would say Ruby vide is very unprofessional, unorganized, and has a blatant disrespect for other people's time."
0,"This is your typical wanna be Phoenix version of the Irish Bar.  The food was ok.  Typical sports bar fare.  I will say the service was pretty good except for the ditzy hostesses.  Do they really need three 16 year olds manning the front of the restaunt texting and pretending to be listening?  \n\nThe happy hour on Friday is great, lasting till 9:00 pm which is unheard of.  But dont stick around much longer after that unless you are  into the club scene. Because out come the lazer beams and smoke machines.... Hahaha no not really but they bust out the dance floor and make you move your seat so Glendales finest underage drinkers can shake their groove things.  It is funny how this bar resembles the cheesy old town bars that westsiders always seem to bag on."
0,"When you enter, you'll find that they're pretty proud for winning awards for being the best Chinese restaurant in Waterloo. Therefore, I had pretty high expectations going into the restaurant. I was hoping that it would be authentic stuff. We waited for 20-30 minutes for a table.\n\nI'll tell you that it's not authentic Cantonese dim sum. It is most definitely the most authentic \""Canadian Chinese\"" food ever. Everything I ate was sweet, even the things that aren't supposed to be. One of my favourite dim sum foods--the rice wrapped in lotus leaf (jun jue gai) is always made savory, but their's tasted like it was dipped in syrup. They also used bbq pork in the jun jue gai instead of conpoy, mushroom, or even chicken (the GAI in the name means chicken). They used pork instead of chicken.\n\nI ordered a lot of things that day and none of them tasted as they should because everything had some superficial sweetness to it. Cantonese cuisine should not taste so... gaudy. Also, the dim sum variety is quite limited.\n\nAs for the waiters/waitresses, there was only one person that spoke Cantonese there (a guy). I think the others were Mandarin and Filipino. Not really a problem, it was just confusing because there was a waitress that kept speaking Mandarin to me. I kept trying to speak Cantonese, but always had to fall back to English.\n\nConsidering all of the high reviews on Yelp for this restaurant, I was very confused when I left. I came on a weekend for dim sum with two others, and we ordered a lot so we could try everything (bill came down to $20 each, which is absurd for dim sum). Sure, we're not in Toronto so I shouldn't compare with delicious dim sum that usually costs like $5 per person at most. Still, I still think it was unjustifiably expensive."
1,"Bravo! This is hands down my new favorite food joint! Nothing beats the prices, portions, and excellent customer service! Everyone here is super down to earth and friendly! It's so relieving and it makes me want to continue coming back. \nI recommend the bloody hot seitan wings, best in town for all you veggies! Also the FRIES!!! Seriously, amazing. I've had a lot of fries in my time, I'm sorry, chips, chips in my time and these are hands down the best I've had!\nMoral of this review, you will not be disappointed."
1,"Look, the food at kathys speaks for its self. Matter of fact its singing the gospel to you with every blissful bite. Now I know soul food like my last name, I was practically raised by the waitresses of soul food restaurants that my pops took me too, not to mention soul food is the only thing my grandparents cook and eat. With that said, the food at Kathy's southern kitchen is by far one of my top five on my list, no question, hands down with ten toes on the ground this spot is on there job. Last night was my second time eating here, the first time a family friend took me and my folks here when we first moved from L.A like six months ago. We came in and seated ourselves because it was only like four or six tables in the joint and besides some dude waiting for his take out order there wasn't any other customers there. We were greeted, Kathy said high and Tiny came over and took are order. I got the smothered chicken, greens and mashed potatoes n' gravy. My girl got ox tails, somebody got the catfish and I forgot what every body else ordered ( it was six months ago and there were five of us so I refuse to remember all the details.) It took about 30-45 minute's for all our food to hit the table witch is quite a wait but there cooking the food to order which is all cool with me, ill practice a little patience. When  Tiny did come with the plates it was evident that it was worth the wait. My smothered chicken was hot, fresh, and the gravy was thick enough and flavorfully but didn't make the chicken too soggy. I had two wings and a breast and they were all moist on the inside, no dry choking hazard white meat here. The greens were good, perfectly seasoned, made me wish I had some pepper juice ( its a down south thing when they get some peppers put them in a jar with what I think is vinegar and let it sit on a shelf for a couple weeks, its bomb on greens ) I could tell the mashed potatoes were made from real mashed potatoes, and that brown gravy on top was no joke. My whole meal was delicious in every meaning of the word. I pressed my girl for some of her ox tails and they were delicious as well, tender, nice size and flavor on point. The food gets my praise, yeah it might be a little pricey but its money well spent. The staff is hella' cool, it feels like I'm just going to the homies moms house for a plate. Kathy's kitchen is were its at bottom line."
1,"Been coming here since open late 2011 and I will never step my foot into another barber shop. The quality, the expertise, and the professionalism were a perfect match with the exceptional taper fade that I usually get. \n\nAbove and beyond.  That about sums it up in 3 words.  Along with the deep shampoo I was given with the cool, minty shampoo (because I had leftover Got2BGlued gunk in my hair) that left me feeling refreshed.  To top off the cut and the razor shave, they give a hot towel massage that left me feeling like a million bucks.  \n\nDefinitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a affordable, quality cut.  \nGood times, good people, and fantastic service"
1,"I was so disappointed with my meal yesterday at Galanga Thai Eatery that I had to try to find some better Thai food today.  Prommares is closed on Sundays, so I took a chance with a new Thai restaurant, and I am so glad that I did!  This is a Thai restaurant that actually focuses on making people happy.  I haven't had service like this since I stopped eating at Thai Grill!  And the food is authentic and good too!  The waitress gave me my own fan even!\n\nAnyway, on to what really counts: the food.  I ordered a Thai iced tea, which wasn't as sweet as most places, but was good still.  I also ordered the duck curry, and sweet sticky rice with mango for desert.  \n\nAt $14, I initially thought the duck curry was a tad pricey, but when the dish was served I quickly realized that the portion of curry was quite generous, particularly in the duck department.  I was completely surprised at how tender the duck was.  I've never had duck at a Thai place this tender!  Yummy!  The yellow curry was soupy, just how I like it, with a unique, perhaps less bold than I prefer, taste.  I ordered a medium spice level, and it wasn't spicy enough, but this can always be remedied with Thai food.  Overall, a very good dish.  \n\nThe mango with sweet sticky rice was good to.  The waitress made sure I knew that the mango wasn't ripe and was going to be sour, so no complaints here... it was indeed sour, but the sweet sticky rice was quite nice.  \n\nI have no clue why this place only has two reviews.  I am tempted to give it five stars, but I can't yet say that Essence of Thai is on par with the (old) Thai Grill and Prommares.  I will definitely be coming back to try some of their other dishes though!"
0,I was a solo guest at the bar. I ordered the buttermilk chicken and a beer. 2 beers and a glass of wine later I had a buzz on but no food. 45 minutes went by and still nothing. Guests that sat and ordered after me got their dishes. Staff was cool about it and comped my drinks but something tells me Chef has no clue in the back of the house. I hear he's a Cowboy Ciao alum. Another spot I had a horrible experience at last time I was in town. So I will probably not be making it to Gladys next time I'm back either.
1,"You can't beat the value, and quality of a haircut from Dat at Brewington's Barber Shop. It's next to the Home Depot at the corner of South Blvd and Woodlawn. Nice people, only $13, and the cut is so much better than elsewhere. Give it a try. Brew does a great job also and is the former owner who works there."
0,"Probably the worst place to get a drink because the service is so awful. This place had gone down hill since I have been going. Our waitress and that evening was so caught up in serving another table all night that she forgot us after three drinks. I finally complained to the bartenders that we couldn't locate her and wanted another glass of wine. She seen what I did and came over but the damage was already done.  She didn't come back to our table for another half and hour and I cleared the table of all our glasses and left them at the bar. She seen me do this but we just got our tab and left.  Bad service, water down drinks and they short change if you pay in cash. Bathrooms toilets have orange scum in them which means they haven't been scrubbed or cleaned for over a two weeks. I should know because I do personal house cleaning and some of my customers are every other week."
0,"What are they trying to achieve here?  They are probably making money, but they could make more.\n\nI walked in at 10pm on a Friday and got in w/o a cover charge and early enough to merit a $5 Ketel/Tonic. Not bad.  The place was kinda empty, but filling up slowly.  The fact that there is a Strip facing and an outside bar helps a bunch.  I saw one girl (a server?) dancing on a satellite bar and noticed a pair of tire swings over the main bar and a go-go cage in the opposite corner.  Ok, cool.  Dancing girls every so often.  The outside bar features daiquiri machines and 32oz souvenir cups and two more dancing bartenders. The girls were easy on the eyes, but nothing to write home about (except for the main bartender - a brunette who could be used as a flotation device in event of a water landing).\n\nSo a casual environment in which to preshow my evening out.  However, the party never took off.  People paid the $5, came in, looked around, maybe bought a beer, stood there with their arms crossed and walked out. I saw it over and over.  I did see one drunk woman decide to become an impromptu go-go dancer by the cage, but security shut her down.  The girls that weren't bartending must have been off duty dancers/eyecandy because they certainly weren't waitresses.  My glass stayed empty for awhile before I decided to belly up to the bar and get another.\n\nTwo more things.  They had couches in a roped-off area with buckets and mixers on the table.  Bottle service in a roadhouse?!? C'mon.  Nothing says culture clash like drinking fancy cocktails while watching a girl in cutoffs swing on a tire.  They also had a groovy looking mirror-tiled ceiling above the lighting truss but never bounced any lights up there.  I think it would've looked cool and expanded the light show to throw a laser or colored spot up there and let it reflect all over the room.\n\nIn the experience-rich environment that is Vegas a bar has to have more than a few things right to pull in the crowds."
1,"The Marksman Bar is very much an old traditional Leith Pub which is full of characters . In the Best Bar None awards they have taken a Silver Award for the last three years which I can assure you is very difficult to achieve. The charity work that is done in this wee small community bar is amazing, so much so that the licensee of the premises won the Unsung Hero Scottish Licensing Award in November 2013. Some of the customers look rough and ready but you should NEVER NEVER  judge a book by its cover, they are actually Rough Diamonds. There is always a warm welcome to strangers.  It is a small pub, spotlessly clean, with very reasonable prices."
0,"Horrible! Please don't waste your time or money. I got a pedi and gel layover with gel polish and two days later the gel start peeling. Two thumbs down! They should change the name to \""Nails you Hate\"""
1,"Being in the restaurant industry I always like to go to the places that my fellow co workers tell me about. My sous chef told me about Ventano's and knowing that my wife loves Italian good it made total sense to go there. We have been there twice in the past three weeks and love everything about this place. The food is great, the service is on point and the atmosphere is great. I have to admit that the view is the best in Las Vegas. I love the short rib special and my wife loves any pasta with the meat sauce. If you are looking for a nice place to getaway to and try some awesome Italian, Ventano's is the place to go."
0,"This place is supposedly owned by the same people that own Sapporo. Or maybe it was and isn't now, I don't know. What I do know is that we have been there many times and the one constant is the shiiiiiiiitttttty service. Here's an anecdote: \n\nThree friends and I went to Ten to get some sushi. We ordered sushi. My little deal is I like to order spicy tuna rolls but--get this--add avocado. Because avocado is good. The couple with me orders a spicy salmon roll, which ordinarily comes with avocado--except that they didn't want the avo. So, among other things, we should be receiving spicy tuna rolls *with* avocado and spicy salmon rolls *without* avocado. Backwards, yes. \n\nWell of course I wouldn't be writing this if that's what had arrived. No, alas, we got our rolls but sans modifiers, i.e. spicy salmon with and spicy tuna without avocado. So I politely pointed this out to the waiter. The appropriate response would be: O. M. G. I'm so sorry--be right back with the correct order. Nope. The waiter looks at the rolls and then goes to check with the sushi chef. He returns and tells us (!) that the rolls are actually correct: that salmon colored roll is indeed tuna, and the tuna colored roll is, in fact, salmon. When confronted with the issue of salmon colored ties (not to mention half of Craig Sager's wardrobe) being named after the wrong goddamned fish, the waiter could only muster a vacant stare and offered to talk to the manager. TALK TO THE MANAGER? \n\nSo the manager comes and reiterates: yes, that is indeed tuna. \""The one colored like salmon?\"" Yes. \""And the tuna colored one?\"" Salmon. Ah. \""Would it matter to you if I told you that I ate the 'tuna' roll and it tasted conspicuously salmony?\"" No, that is indeed tuna. We add to our tuna (insert name of some made up, nonexistent spice that turns tuna salmon color and vice-versa) and that makes it look that way. \n\nNow I'm making this story drag, I admit. But the concept of someone so brazenly lying to me (or just being plain fucking stupid) is highly irritating to me. If it weren't, I'd watch fox news. But no, the manager and waiter all stuck to their story. What I should have done is played along and ordered a spicy \""salmon\"" roll, complete with avocado. But I was too pissed to do that, and so instead I argued with the manager and embarrassed my friends. Sorry all. \n\nMoral of the story: Ten has mediocre food and fucking dipshits working the sushi bar. If you trust these mensas with raw fish that you're about to eat, go ahead. Otherwise I recommend Celsius or Shogun. (reviews to come, maybe.)"
0,I've been here twice (because after my first time I didn't want to go back but decided to give it another try). Both times they were slow behind the counter (trying to be like a Chipotle) and the food was just not enjoyable at all. Would rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba.
0,"I have couple rental units.  One tenant mentioned that the water heater pilot went out.  Call the gas company.  They say the unit needs a new lighting device.  Called Freddie Plumbing.  Since the unit was only 2 years old, the staff suggested changing the lighter.  He also mentioned that the unit was not installed correctly, and corrected the improper install for additional charges.  I was not on site.  I tried to pay with my credit card, he said his credit card machine was down. End up depositing a check at his bank.   I ask him for receipt, he said he'll mail it.  Never mail the receipt.  And I thought problem solve.  I even give him a good review on Yelp.  Wrong.   \n\nThree months later, a new tenant move in.   The gas company guy came out and tried to light the water heater.  No go.  Surprisingly, the gas guy put a do not use red tag on the unit stating that the install was done incorrectly and unsafe to use.  Upon closer examination, the old lighting device is gone.   Face cover is gone too.  The Freddie's staff just strip everything.  The only way to light the unit now is to do it the old fashion way using a long match.   \n\nI though no problem, call Freddy Plumbing.  After all he had 28 reviews and many positive remarks.  Wrong.  I have the new tenant try to arrange Freddie's Plumbing to address the issue.  They say they never service the house.  WTF.  I have a copy of the cancel check.  B.S. I tried to call Freddie Plumbing, myself.  No one is there to pick up the phone.  I don't know what's going on, but I am very disappointed.  I though I had a good plumber for the Norther Phoenix area. \n\nEnd up going with Proskill in Anthem.  He is going to replace the unit for $600 installed.  I should have done this in the first place."
1,"Funny as hell , a bit raunchy , in a cool way , not for kids ,it's not in Ceasars Building but in a tent next door."
1,"I had the southwest turkey sandwich which had Turkey, sweet roasted red peppers, southwest sauce and pepper jack cheese. Topped with mixed greens and avocado....it was soooooooo good.  I couldn't eat all of it...very filling.  The waffle fries were really good, well seasoned.  Next time I will have to have a beer!"
0,Save yourself some time and don't go here. So many good places around here and this place just isn't one.
0,"The service was amazing, we were well taken care of and the menu was explained very well. We ordered the pork belly as an appetizer which was delicious. My wife ordered the Filet and I ordered the new york strip, both were very tastey. We order the truffled potatoes as a side which was pretty good. You might be wondering why I am giving it a one star if the food and service were so good. Well that night my wife and I were both extremely sick. We fasted all day to enjoy the food so I am certain we were sick from Gordon Ramsay Steak. We were up all night in the bathroom and are still feeling the effects two days later. To think that I paid 200 dollars to get sick leaves me very upset. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I knew it would be a little over priced just because it had Gordon Ramsay's name attached but paying that much money to get sick is just unacceptable."
1,"Agree with the previous great reviews.  Based on those reviews, I went by there and got a battery for my watch.  Quick and easy and they are so incredibly nice and personable.  You can join an email list for monthly emails of coupons or specials and to make this place even sweeter....it is right next to a walk up/drive through Starbucks.  A win win if you ask me!"
1,"Great little bistro, we each ordered the Cabernet Burger, not all burgers are created equal! Treat yourself.  Outdoor seating was nice and very quiet and very relaxing."
1,"I would give this place all the stars, but we had some issues regarding our room keys, as well as dealing with the front desk staff.  Besides that, the service was great!  The best part about the Vdara and the surrounding casinos in the area is its location!  Sandwiched right in the middle of the strip, you have everything you want (two malls, casinos, nightlife, etc) and still retreat to the hotel after you've had your fill and need to replenish your strength (2hr naps suffice) to start the madness all over again.\n\nValet staff is dope, bell services were dope, housekeeping was dope, room service food was delicious, but we just had an issue with the front desk with our keys.  My brother ended his night early at 2am on one night, and he had to wait an hour downstairs to get back into our room.  Our second issue with front desk was when we were looking for a lost item in the room. We were asked to wait in the lobby while they made the necessary phone call to security to check, the male at the desk never got back to us on our query, even when there no longer were lines of people who needed servicing.  When I had gone back up to the desk and asked the lady working next to him to please follow up, she got us our help in less than 5 minutes.  All this while the first worker was listening, he didn't even bother to acknowledge that he helped me previously.\n\nThe panoramic suite that we had was awesome!  I wish it was my apartment, just not in Vegas, if that was the case, I'd probably be in a lot of trouble every weekend, hopefully not every night.  The one other thing I did not like was that the pool was unavailable due to construction the weekend we were there, we should have had some of the hotel fees reflect that.  All in all, I would still return here because I really do like the fact that Vdara is a Hotel Resort and not a Casino Resort."
1,"My left front tire looked a little low, so I stopped by to have them check it. It was right at 6:00 PM and the sign on the door said they closed at 6:00.  I went in and the guy behind the counter asked what I needed and he went out and checked all four tires.  He recommended we add a little air. He did that. \n\nHe did not ask if I had bought my tires there, which I actually had, or if I was already a customer.  \n\nGreat customer service.  This is why I will always go to Discount Tire.  Their employees understand how to take care of customers and keep them coming back. \n\nExcellent job!\n\nKen Jackson"
1,I love it!!! Everything is sooo good~
1,Awesome stuff!
0,"Drink this. Turn to the left. Swallow. Get out.\n\nThe visit was extremely rushed. Nobody made any attempt to answer questions about the procedure or what was going on. Or why I was getting tests done in the first place. They just rushed through the entire thing. I felt like nothing but a piece of meat.\n\nThe whole experience made what should have been a routine visit for a simple procedure into an utter nightmare.\n\nThe front desk couldn't explain what was needed for the procedure without asking specific questions. They got downright angry when I asked for the address.\n\""It's on Rainbow\"" is a pretty lousy answer. Rainbow is a long road.\n\nEquipment looked like it hadn't been sanitized since the late 80s. I'm pretty sure an X-ray machine shouldn't be covered with the yellow crust like the bottom of a toilet seat."
0,dont bother
0,"This review only concerns their New Year's Eve party. \n\nI was completely hussled out of the $78 I paid for my ticket. Line to get in took at least 30 minutes, closer to an hour if you came later than the start time. People without tickets rushed in at one point. Coat check was $5 extra once inside and they quickly ran out of hangers. \""Top Shelf Open Bar\"" turned out to be bottom shelf liquors. The several bars were constantly out of sprite, tonic, various liquors, etc. Venue was way overcrowded. Bartenders were rude and lied about what was available. Bathroom lines were insane and became utter chaos until bouncers got involved near midnight. Avoid this place."
1,"Food is pretty good. Always consistent. Customer facing staff is very professional and courteous. However the staff in the back which is viewable from the ToGo area was flipping each other off and goofing around. Nothing too bad, but still unprofessional.\n\nWish the menu was a little more \""deli\"" traditional. Granted I know it's not a NY deli, but the variety is a little low. Would like to see some Italian style subs."
1,"Lunch on the way to the airport.  An excellent way to end our inaugural Vegas trip.\n\nEverything was what I read about and expected.  The dingy, sketchy, vacant strip mall.  The low key restaurant facade and interior. The extensive menu and wine list.  And then there was the food.  I have been eating Thai food for years, with lots of authentic, top notch Thai restaurants in my neighborhood. Lotus blew them away.\n\nThe tod mun plar (deep fried fish cake) was cooked perfectly and was a great way to start our meal.  I then had the kang renu nakorn with chicken, which is a red curry but without coconut milk and lots of vegetables.  Spicy and tons of flavor, I think the best part was how it completely cured my hangover.  My husband had the drunken noodles with soft shell crab, which was a phenomenal dish.  \n\nI liked that this place was mostly locals; while were there it was mostly hospital and office workers on their lunch break.\n\nThe lunch buffet looked excellent and is probably worth trying as well.\n\nI am glad we were able to get here and I hope we return one day."
0,They used to do a good job but now they don't seem to care about costumer's satisfaction. The guy who was cleaning my car spent a lot of time texting.
1,We thought coming by around 2pm would pass the lunch rush but it was still packed. There were 8 of us and we had to wait a while because there weren't any tables available that would fit all of us. \n\nThe food was good; I had like 3 servings of the mac n' cheese and 10 of these little ice cream cones filled with goat cheese. \n\nThey must have been switching to the afternoon/dinner items because 1/3 of the stations were closed and they weren't refilling certain items.
1,"took little lucy here and she did great.  :) she just gets the brush and bath but leaves so clean a her coat is so soft  afterwards.  their pricing is spot on, in my opinion, and I actually asked to have her teeth cleaned in stead of having her nails trimmed and it wasn't a problem at all and no extra charge.  thought she might not like it since it was her first grooming experience but she left happy as a clam!!!  we'll see you guys soon and I'll be sure to spread the word on how great you guys are :)"
0,"You get what you pay for..... this should be 1 star but they get another one for having some decent prices when you need a flight last minute.  Having flown with them 3-4 times over the years I just can't picture myself flying with them again unless they make some major changes. From customer service, the morale of your attendants, baggage fees, and multiple delays, why choose US Airways when you have better alternatives? Pay a little more and avoid the headache"
0,"This Starbucks has a huge sign stating it now serves breakfast. After waiting in line for 10 minutes on 2 occasions, I was told \""the delivery didn't arrive\"". They simply advertise something they never have....."
1,"LGO is awesome! The only thing that could make them better is if they served their pizza all the time. I think it is only available after 5 or 6 pm. They tend to be busy around dinner time, but trust me the wait is worth it, plus you can wonder around the shop next door and buy some cool nic-nacks, wine or coffee. They also have a counter to order food from if you don't want to sit down and you can take your food to go. \n\nWe have eaten here several times and love it! I love trying different types of hot wings, and theirs are awesome! They are a flavor you are sure to enjoy and cannot get anywhere else. Perfectly spicy with that kick in the back of your throat and tons of flavor. \n\nYou must check out their win list, tons to choose from and all price point anyone can afford to buy a bottle. We got a yummy Malbec that was only $13.99. Winning! After we enjoyed some wings we shared a couple pizzas.... The Gladiator (sausage, pepperoni and basically meat lovers) and a Margarita. Both amazing! The crust is perfection. I wanted to finish the whole thing, but couldn't.... I had to leave room for some dessert. We shared the Sea Salt Cookie with vanilla gelato, wow so good, I had to ask someone to remove it from the table so I didn't turn into a complete glutton. \n\nMoral of the story, LGO is awesome... and I hear there is one in the air port now, sweet!"
1,For the best belgian waffle this place is a must try on your bookmark on yelp!  Belgian waffle is like eating dessert for breakfast so so so good. The dough is made the original way free wifi good good good coffee. If you like this place sign up on there website to receive text messages for good promotion.
1,"had a very nice experience at this place.  The waiter was very attentive!  there were 13 of us , 5 children under age 8 years and 8 adults.  although i am the only one who ordered the fish, it was good!  they teased me because they told me that i should have ordered steak because it is a steak house!!  i didnt care...i am a seafood person..."
1,"I love this PHO and spring rolls, and for the friendly and fast service plus it's cheap! Oh it's truly a must try place."
1,"Having spent the last 10 days in Portland, we came back to Phoenix lamenting about the creative food scene here - why can't Phoenix have more of 'that'! Well here you go - Short Leash Sit...Stay is what we're talking about. We had the corn dog bits appetizer with spicy mustard and a Devil Dog - with spicy beer hot dog. The food pops! Wonderful! The corn dog bits were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of batter, and the hot dog wrapped in flat bread was an amazing mix of spicy flavors. All the hot dogs on the menu sounded delicious. We will be back. Love the owners mission: \""eating well and surrounding yourself with people who make you happy\"" - mission accomplished. Highly recommended."
1,"I frequent the Desert Ridge location often.  I usually sit at the bar when I'm alone and always have very prompt and friendly service.  \n\nAnyone that is familiar with PJ knows they have the BEST hummus in town.  I love to get the trio of regular, roasted red pepper, and cilantro jalapeno.  And for an entree, top it off with a protein such as the ahi tuna, chicken, or steak.\n\nMy BF and I will often split the Chicken Curry Salad, a side order of Tahini Cauliflower, and the Mixed Beans AND we STILL have left overs.\n\nMy new recent favorite is the Veggie Lavosh Wrap.  OMG, even if you aren't a Veg Head this is sooo yummy and a HUGE portion!\n\nAlso, if you are on a budget... House Wines (Red & White) & Margaritas are super cheap!"
1,"This is a great dive bar and worth venturing off the Vegas Strip. As a local this is a favorite destination for our Friday Happy Hour. Upon entering the Tiki Room it will take your eyes a bit to adjust to the darkness, but once adjusted you can take in the interesting and festive decor throughout the small space. I love all the lighted puffer fish strung across the ceiling.  You can read the cocktail menu by candle light and you will want to, the descriptions are hilarious. Pay attention to the number of skulls after each cocktail, this will give you an indication of how strong each drink is. The drinks are tasty, potent and will not disappoint. You will find traditional tiki drinks such as the Lapu Lapu and several of Frankie's original tiki drinks. My favorite drink is the Lava Letch, made with ginger beer.\n\nFrankie's is a great time with cool decor, strong drinks and a fun vibe. Cheers."
0,Would give this a zero star rating if possible. \n\nCame in here for new breaks last year because it was close to our house. Once they said they were done with the breaks I took off to a job I had that day. Horrible screeching noise which made me go back there for them to fix it. \n\nAgain still noise and after only half a year I know I needed new breaks again! Went to econolube down the road today and even they found some un secure bolt that PurrfectAuto had placed in there and was carving the rotors.
0,"The staff is friendly but both times I've gone to this location the cashier who also happens to be the manager got my order wrong somehow. When I told her it didn't look/taste right she was confident that she made it correctly but took it back to \""fix\"" it but it still wasn't right. I didn't want to be a nuisance so I still took it. But the times my mom or sister went and brought a drink back for me they were fine so I guess I'm just unlucky. Their breakfast sandwiches are pretty decent as well."
1,"ok, I have changed my insurance carrier about a 6 months ago and I thought, well what's the big deal, they're all the same, wrong, unfortunately I was involved in 2 incidents since I got the new policy, not my fault but I must say I was impressed with the way it was handled, from the customer service to the appointment to drop off and pick up the car after it was repaired, painless, I didn't have too many providers before but for me at this point I don't know what would make me change to another insurance company. I only have good words to say about the people that handled my claim."
0,"Unfortunately, since this fab store is closing, they could care less about their customers.  They will tell you that you can return something even though they will be closing soon...and they won't honor this policy.  I bought several door knobs for my remodel and ended up with 2 too many (Baldwin knobs) and they wouldn't take them back even though they specifically told me they would."
0,"They have painted the interior since I was in last making it look nicer but there are no new beds. I was going to try them out again(I know - why go back, I should know better) but the only stand up booth had a line and there was lotion all of the front door handle(inside and out) and the floor looked to also have lotion on it!  \n\nNot sure how long the lotion was there for but either way it's gross and dangerous. The boy used to go here but cancelled his membership and he was told that he had to come back when a manager was there. Thankfully he asked for the form that he would have to come back and sign and got that taken care of. The receptionist advised the manager would call him to confirm the cancellation and the date being effective and never heard back. They cancelled it but didn't bother to do what they said they would. \n\nHe also had been going there for years and had one of their super cheap rates from the days of PB. They didn't care at all about him cancelling but when I tried to cancel they tried everything to get me to stay... probably because I was a sucker and was paying twice as much. Done and Done.  No customer care, not clean(still) and bad business conduct."
0,"This Subway is absolutely terrible.  I like subway and it's food in general, but this branch is completely ruined by absolutely terrible service and quite possibly the worst employees I've ever seen at a food establishment.\n\nNow, I've been here about 20-25 times since it's only a block away from my work (and it's one of the healthiest things to grab nearby), and the same damn issues are present every single time.  I've now stopped going completely since I can't stand this branch.\n\nFirst off, they are always out of ingredients or bread.  I usually get the chicken breast foot long sub.  There had to be at least 10 occasions I went and they had no chicken breasts.  It's also not uncommon for them to be out of bread, and common ones too.  No wheat, no Italian?  There's been a few instances where all they had left was something obscure like Monterery Cheddar, and this isn't some off hour.  Its usually right during lunch!   I can understand once or twice, but you think they would take action to stop this from happening since it seems to happen ALL THE TIME?  Anybody ever think to make more bread???\n\nThey have been out of tomatoes, out of peppers, onions out of cucumbers... It's ridiculous.  The worst part is they act rude instead of apologetic.  \""WE DONT HAVE THAT...\""  ok.... no need to yell at me there.... \n\nHonestly though, the worst part are the employees.  It's been the same 4 people every time I go.  The least worse of the bunch is the manager.  She is an older lady, and while generally nice, there have been days where she has been outwardly disgruntled, and talked to customers rudely, looking as she was almost ready to snap, but usually she is able to keep it shelled in... The other employees, *sigh...\n\nThere's two younger girls who work there.  They have never been rude, but they work extremely lethargically.  They often keep asking what you want, and take a long time to put your sub together.  They really need to pep up, because they just act like it's killing them to be there...  Maybe it is killing them, but you work a customer service job, you got to perk up!\n\nThe last employee that works there is a young male and he appalls me every single time with his actions.  I really have no idea how he still has a job.  His behavior is ridiculous. He is probably, and consistently, the most disgruntled employee in the entire world...\n\n He throws sandwiches together like they were no better than mush.  He doesn't change his gloves often so I have had far too many sandwiches with buffalo chicken sauce, oriental sauce, etc etc on my sandwich.... Yea, big no no.  Thank god I don't have allergies, but hot buffalo chicken sauce definitely does not taste any what appetizing smeared all over my cold cut either...\n\nIt  doesn't stop there.  He rants about his job to every single customer.  No one even asks him, yet he is constantly letting you know how badly his job sucks and how he can't handle it.  It's like sheesh man, we all worked crappy jobs at some point, but that attitude sure isn't going to get you anywhere....  \n\nIt's not even something like a dreary \""Man, I'm having a rough day...\""  It's more like a resentful \""God! why do so many damn people have to come in, I can't believe this shit... AGHH KILLLLL MEEEE PLEASE.\""\n\nNo lie people.... that is what he does, and that is why I get so bothered by it.  In some ways, he acts like so much of a trainwreck it's almost amusing to watch his anger grow.  I've had my fair share of watching him throw stuff, bang his head off a wall, and even once scream \""F*** my life!!!!\"" during the middle of making a sub after he dropped the bun on the floor.  Still, for as funny as it could be, it's just plain rude.  He has made fun of customers several times, and his constant whining gets on one's nerves way too easily.  He acts like he is the only one with problems in his life...\n\nAll and all, I love the Subway chain in general, but this branch has serious issues.  The service is terrible, and the staff is rude and downright horrendous with the way they act.  I still love Subway, but I will never go to this branch again."
1,"Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. \nAlso, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. \nAnd they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years."
0,"I am giving one star because I cannot give zero.  Our company tried Gaudin Ford for Service on one of our many trucks.  After several calls, and emails back and forth for a simple appointment we finally just dropped our diesel truck off for an oil service. When we picked it up, the bill was well over the estimate. In reviewing the bill it was discovered they also rotated the tires for $65, a service we never requested !  They also noted an oil drip. But when I asked them where it was dripping from they advised it would be an additional $140 to tell me that, even though their tech was just under our truck changing the oil. Amazing.\nWhen I brought the additional charges to the attention of the Quick Lane Manager Eric Curtis, he  immediately became defensive and belligerent and told me to \""go sit down\"" and he would fix it.  Now, keep in mind, he didn't ask me to \""have a seat\"", he didn't ask me to \""kindly wait, he told me in a loud voice to \""go sit down !\"".   If he was my employee talking to a customer that way I would have fired him on the spot.  We had to come back several hours later to pickup the truck after they un-rotated the tires and put them back as they were when we came in.  Now today, 5 days later I just received a call from Gaudin. I had thought maybe they were calling to address our issues.  No, they were calling about the appointment request from the prior week to tell me that I could bring our truck in !!!   Obviously Gaudin Ford is a very confused business.\nWe have been in the automotive / truck business for 30 years now and we will never go back to Gaudin Ford. They dropped the ball every step of the way. \nThere are too many other good and reputable choices out there."
1,"The portions here are huge.  I was a bit sick this time around so all I had was the mango salad.  Can't review it this time around since my taste buds are off, but the salad was still good considering I was sick.  Will update it next time I'm in vegas."
0,"I ended up in the emergency room within an hour of eating here with a terrible allergic reaction to something.  I'm deathly allergic to shellfish and didn't order anything with shellfish in it which scares me that there is cross contamination with the shrimp in the kitchen. I will more than likely not be back, in fear that could happen again."
0,Ordered food for delivery last night. The General Tso's Chicken was awful. It was like they didn't cook the chicken pieces long enough. Breading was droopy/soggy - there was no crispiness at all. Carrots were not cooked all the way through either. Wontons were cold.
1,"We love this place.  Yes, it is too noisy and uber casual but the food is just yummy.  If you go be sure to get the red lentil soup, the hummus with chicken, salad, or virtually any entree.  They supersize most dinners so be prepared to eat a lot or take a doggy bag home.  Also a great place for vegetarians. Good place for a quick meal before or after a Harikins movie (located in the same shopping center)."
1,"Do you like any of the below?\n\n(a) rice\n(b) adobo\n(c) eggs\n(d) feeling full\n\nIf you picked any of the letters above, adobo fried rice is a must."
1,"I love this park. I take my dog here quite often since it's so close to where I live. The people are friendly, my only complaint are those that take unaltered dogs into the park or who have dogs in the park that are wearing prong collars. For the most part the area is clean and large enough to allow for lots of play. There's also a 1.5 mile trail to the side of the park that leads to the skate park. It's nice to walk my dog taking the trail to the dog park and allow him a reward of off leash play afterward.\nThere is a playground separate from the dog park area that is perfect for children and several nice walking paths. The rules for the dog park area are posted and it's closed on Wednesdays."
0,"Ok so we always drive by Jordan's and wonder if it is any good. The building looks nice and they have been around forever. We got a coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try. The parking lot was pretty full for late at night. We go in and are seated and look at the menu. Both of us commented on the odd assortment of items on the Combo. Our first clue was all of the help looked as if they were from the Mid-West. We decided to have the Fajitas and a Combo. They brought out some chips that reminded me of the ones you get at Safeway in the giant bag for a buck or two. Then there was the \""Salsa\"". It was basically Catsup, not Ketchup as in Heinz or some other reputable product, but the stuff in the huge container for 99cents, mixed with something like hot sauce. We ordered Cheese Crisps. They were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top. Then the food came out. Let's just say, having eaten at Ponchos Buffet, there is worse, but places like this are usually found in the Mid-West where the people think Taco Bell is authentic. The only redeeming value to this place was the Ice Tea was tasty, that and the cashier offered to let us buy some candy to make the $40 bill (for two) so we could get the $10 off rather than the $5 off of a $20. Purchase. I thank-you for this, because it was certainly not a $40 meal ore a $30, or even a $10 for that matter, but Sir, you earned a second star because of that. Well actually it was only a half star and you added a star but since I can't give a one and a half stars, you get two. \n\nFellow Yelpers you have been warned. Check Yelp first, no matter how good a deal it seems."
1,Super cool and relaxed environment. Great place to go for an after work drink and burger. Staff is really friendly and personable especially the Murphy brothers. Always a good time at this neighborhood establishment.
1,"I first heard about Bacon through Yelp but kind of forgot about it after my first exclamation of, \""This place sound great! I'm definitely going to brunch it up here.\"" Then when I was driving around Scottsdale we went right past it and my excitement to give it a shot returned with avengence. I don't live in Scottsdale but am there frequently, and I am glad that the trend of brunch restaurants is catching on. \n\nWe went on a Sunday around 10:30 a.m. and only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. The place is really open with lots of sky lights and floor-to-ceiling windows that open up in the front of the restaurant. We were seated in the back corner but still got lots of natural light and felt part of the patron community. Unfortunately, we were seated next to a table of six people who were very loud/drunk and were there to party and watch football...which is weird. \n\nI split one of the protein whole wheat pancakes as an appetizer and it ended up being my favorite part of the meal, it was sweet and filling. Then I went with the mexican omelet (egg whites with pico de gallo, avocado, cheese, salsa) which was huge and I could only eat half. You could tell it was just whipped up and had all super fresh ingredients. It came with fruit (that was mostly finely chopped melon, aka filler fruit) and very yummy toast with blackberry jam. \n\nThe owner's family was sitting right behind us and it was nice to see how he interacted with them, and how they interacted with the staff...like one big happy family. He was walking around the restaurant the entire time, helping out where needed and talking to customers, which is something that I really appreciate. He also stopped by and gave us a sample of the best apple fritter I've ever tasted yet they do not have on the menu...which was random but most welcomed."
1,"Stopped by here on a Saturday night for dinner with friends.... and ended up staying like 4 hours!\n\nWe ordered drinks, hookah, and dinner menu items.\n\nThe food was delicious, and the homemade pita bread was outstanding.\nThe hookah was delicious... but the real standout here was the service.\n\nEverytime I thought we may need new coals... BAM, there they were offering us new coals.  If we were close to being out of a drink, BAM, another drink would appear!\nThey even brought over complimentary smoothie tastings, and gave us $10 off coupons for our next visit.\n\nAfter 9:30pm there was a live band that played inside and people danced on the dance floor, and there was a belly dancer performing on the patio!\n\nLoved loved loved it."
0,"Not my favorite place. I went today to get added RAM for my MAC computer. I was unable to purchase this at the apple store due the fact that apple only carries current stuff in their store bc space is limited. The guy that was helping at Best Buy, not friendly, not knowledgable, unable to answer questions I had. Needless to say, I did not purchase from Best Buy. Off to Frys electronics I go."
1,"Best lounge in Pittsburgh.  Great scene, great music and food is awesome for happy hour or late night!!  Go there every week at least once."
1,"Salad was great, extremely fresh cucumber and tomato!  Chicken spiced just right and really moist.   Tzatziki sauce was some of the best I've ever eaten.  Small dining area .  Felt sorry for the ONE waitress, she was having to run the take out orders in front plus waiting on dining room !   But she gave polite efficient service no frills.  Will defiantly be back to eat  at the Mad Greek on my next trip to Southpark mall"
1,I had the most fantasic dinner there. The service was perfect. The food blew me away. And the wine pairing suggested by the Sommerlier we so enjoyable. I can't wait to go back. This is fine dining!
1,"Classic Pittsburgh, without all the parking hassle.  This location is easily accessible from I-79 and just a little ways from the Parkway (now I-376).\n\nMy favorite is the capicola & cheese.  The chili is underrated and quite spicy.\n\nIf you're a Primanti's virgin, resist the urge to make any alterations to the Primanti's sandwich recipe -- you will like it!\n\nThe food tastes the same here as all the other locations. Pick some up on your way to the airport and carry on to the plane!"
0,"Guests BEWARE, my advice if you dine here is PAY ATTENTION!!!! Food lines the kitchen counters that should be under refrigeration! Bacon & Sausage sits in a pan on top of the grill ALL DAY. Fresh squeezed OJ could be half fresh from machine and the rest from a picture from up to days juiced earlier! Iced Tea not brewed fresh daily!!!!"
1,"so many vegetarian options! I like it because it is close to home and the food comes out quick. Our waitress, Ece, was really sweet and it was nice to reminisce about Turkey with her. I'm very picky about pita and that is the only flaw - not a fan of the pita bread. But I can overlook that. I'll def be back."
1,"I gotta admit, I'm a pretty big fan.  I like cheap.  I like tasty.  This review is for the Happy Hour part at Yard House...I've never eaten any regular meals there!  Everytime we've gone, it's for Happy Hour.  Yes, Yard House does keep me happy!  Just look at my check-ins for this place.\n\nOK, yes, it's bar food, and yes, it's nothing overly stellar.  But for what they do it is remarkable in terms of food.  And the prices!  You can easily get away for feeding a group of four for under $35.  Take your kids, take your friends, double date!  A good time can be had for little cost.\n\nYard House has Happy Hour M-F from 3 PM - 6 PM, Sun-Wed from 10 PM - Close.  Lots of opportunity to stock up on grub!  Our first time here was on a hunch since we were staying at Red Rock Casino at the time for my birthday.  We've been back at least twice a month since!  Payday = YHHH day (Yard House Happy Hour).\n\nMost days, especially weekdays after 5 PM Yard House is packed!  The good thing about their Happy Hour is that you can sit ANYWHERE in the restaurant and partake in the cheapy goodness.  No need to only sit at the bar or the patio.  Happy Hour indeed!  We bring our kids quite often to eat with us.\n\nFor Happy Hour at Yard House there is a plethora of food and drink selections.  Pints (of a $hi+load of different choices) go fron $3.75 - $5.75 range.  Half yards go from the $7.50 - $10.00 range, house martinis are $6.50, and specialty drinks and wine by the glass are $2.00 off.  But honestly, I come for the food!  For me Yard House does not disappoint!\n\nYard House has a bunch of appetizers and pizzas that are 1/2 price during Happy Hour.  Choices abound, variety too!  Some of our most ordered faves:\n\n-Spicy Thai Chicken or BBQ Chicken Pizza\n-Fried Calamari\n-Hawaiian Poke Stack (most def a fave)\n-Onion Ring Tower\n-Chicken Nachos (another fave)\n-Seared Ahi Sashimi (yet another fave)\n-Spicy Tuna Roll (it's not sushi but we like it anyway)\n-Buffalo Wings\n-Chicken or Mushroom Lettuce Wraps\n\nOn most occasions we will have nearly all these items on our table!  We are piggies!  It's a good thing the tables at Yard House are HUGE.  No matter though, whatever we don't finish we take home for leftovers later!  Although we ALWAYS end up finishing the Hawaiian poke stack and the seared ahi.  Those are very ONO.  \n\nYard House doesn't offer sushi like other Happy Hour joints around Las Vegas but no matter.  Their food usually fits the bill pretty good.  Another plus?  Each dish available during Happy Hour ranges from $5 - $8...and they are full appetizer servings!  Cheap, and lots of it.  A very good choice for decent eats in the Summerlin area!\n\nI have a beer (or three), and a few appetizers and I'm as happy as a clam during Happy Hour.  It is a good time.  Service is very courteous and pretty quick, even during peak Happy Hour time.  Keep up the cheap eats Yard House, I will be back!  H-A-P-P-Y H-O-U-R"
1,"On so many levels, this is THE place to go when in the neighborhood.\n\nWhy?  Because it is always sincerely friendly, has a great French atmosphere, has wonderful food, and a really good bar.\n\nThen add to that they can make excellent espresso drinks to go with their superb deserts.  (I find that very few places can make espresso to rival that found in Europe)\n\nThe street-side patio is also well designed and comfortable.\n\nAnother comment seems appropriate here.\nMy wife and I have been regulars at Zinc Bistro for about four years.  Yes, we did have one incredibly clueless waitress one time out of all the times we have dined there.  But we also have had occasion to observe some of the best customer service in town, as was the case when we met our son's family of four there for dinner, but arrived 40 minutes late due to a freeway accident.  I apologized profusely upon arrival. But they said everything was OK, and that our grandchildren had been given Shirley Temples, and that my usual Saphire martini was just taken to our table (prompted by my son).\n\nOf all the very good restaurants in Scottsdale, I put Zinc Bistro up there with the very best.  What are the other best places in town?  Please see my other reviews."
0,"Decided to stop here for some late night eats after a night spent downtown. Had just a Philly Sandwich with the cheese wiz and a small soda...$12 seemed kind of steep. The Sandwich was so so, there was a generous portion of steak on the sandwich and the bread was not to bad. It definitely was not a straight out of Philly experience for me...not awful by any means but I don't think I would be pumped up to go back."
1,"Last Saturday my best friend from out of town and I came up with the goofy idea to get BFF tattoos and we decided to go to 510 Expert Tattoo.  I follow a few of the artists that work there on Instagram so I was interested in visiting this particular shop.  When walking in, we were somewhat intimidated by the guys, but they were really friendly and able to fit us both in later on the schedule for that day.  \n\nWe returned at our given time and although our idea was ridiculous and corny, they were professional and thorough with drawing up exactly what we wanted.  Evan was my artist and he was very nice and did an amazing job. Oh, and he was VERY patient.  I would recommend anyone to come to this clean and talented shop!"
0,Worst customer service! But they don't care! I even spoke to a manager and he would not exchange my defective device.  What happen to taking care of your customer?
1,Visited here on vacation.  The Mac N Cheese burger was awesome.  Alex  was very helpful and looked great in her little denim dress.  Great visit!
1,"For a local lunch spot, this place is great. The food is always excellent, and the servers are very friendly. The prices are incredibly low, making it one of the best deals in town.\n\nService is sometimes a little slow, but that's a small price to pay. The place could use a little \""sprucing up\""... it's a little dated and run down."
0,"Where to begin?\n\nI went to Muramoto for my birthday dinner, and called a day in advance to reserve a table for a large group of people. Two people joined our group at the last second, but I didn't think it would be a major problem to add a chair on either end of the table. I approached our server and apologized for the inconvenience, but asked if we could get two more chairs.\n\nI was met with a brisk, \""We don't really have any more chairs.\"" It should be noted that without moving my head, I could see at least three vacant chairs and one or two lining the wall. Not everyone had arrived yet, however, so I didn't raise the issue again until they did. The server begrudgingly made another place setting before barking, \""Just sit down here, because if you move and the order gets screwed up, it's going to take me, like, fifteen minutes to fix.\""\n\nThis is also around the time that two of my guests mentioned that something was dripping on them. Indeed, the ceiling was dripping water. When they mentioned it to the server, he said, \""Oh, yeah. The air conditioning's over you and it leaks a bit. I was going to recommend you leave that chair vacant, but since you're already short on seats now...\""\n\nI was taken aback, partially because of his rude tone, and partially because I couldn't understand how someone would be so preternaturally stupid as to 1) put a chair under a leaking air conditioner and 2) expect that all seats in the reservation wouldn't be filled.\n\nOne of my guests did not receive her soda for forty minutes, and another guest did not receive one of her plates of sushi until just before we were about ready to leave.\n\nThe two stars above are for the chef, to whom I give my compliments. Everyone was thrilled with their appetizers and the sushi itself was very well-prepared. Compliments to the bar, as well. I had a delicious drink called, \""Keep Calm and Carry On.\"" I would suggest the servers at this establishment take the drink's name as a piece of advice."
0,"These People are the Rudest A**holes ever. First off after Charging close to $600 worth of work, then broke my car. My Brake pedal was almost to the floor, and they told me it was my back brakes. They adjusted the back brakes and there was NO CHANGE in pedal height. They striped 4 bolts on the \""Upper Oil Pan\"" (engine). They do not even stand behind they're work. \n\nI took my car to another mechanic and I was told it was the Brake Power Booster. I got it replaced CORRECTLY and now my brakes work great (not thanks to these A**HOLES!)"
1,"This place is a wee gem, hidden in plain sight. The place has a great feel, and the range of delightful looking sweet and savoury treats is a sight to behold. Their soup was great and the baguette I had was just tremendous.\n \nOverall, we said: \""French Fancies, whilst not cheap compared with neighbouring takeaway options, offers extremely high quality. I have a feeling that their sit-in prices compare very favourably, something I will certainly be testing, as I can imagine myself popping back here on many occasions in the future. I'd recommend you pay it a visit soon, too, as I have a feeling you'll find it as richly rewarding as I did.\"""
1,"The bar is always a great option here, the staff is very good and the food is great.\n\nThe orange edamame is great, spicier than the original"
1,OMG!! Been wanting to try this place for months!  Tonight my husband took me there for our anniversary dinner!  Best eggplant parmesan I've ever eaten!  You have to have the Hawaiian Margarita!  It's awesome!  They also have a great white wine selection!  Dry to sweet and all the ones I tasted were excellent!  Great Italian fare! Hubby got a lasagna and loved it. We started with fresh shrimp cocktail.....really fresh! For living in the desert it was superb!  If you find yourself in Vegas looking for great affordable Italian food look no further than The Grotto at The Golden Nugget!  You won't be disappointed!  Awesome wait staff and bartenders who mix a mean drink!
1,Always solid. The new slider apps are phenomenal. Rack of lamb is pure money. Pair with a glass of the Bordeaux and you're enjoying life. Best risotto in town by far. Waitress is really helpful. Call for reservations to be safe.
0,"So disappointed. So I went to PT's Place on 05/22/10 after having a bad experience at Pt's pub on sahara. We literally left sahara and came to this location. We have been here before and never had a problem. This night was busy, but I mean not anything that a bartender can't handle. We sat there for I don't know how long without any recognition, the bartend came to our side of the bar and never asked us if we needed anything even though there was 4 of us and 1 soda in front of us that didn't even belong there. After a good 10 or so minutes, probably longer, we decided to leave. Strike 2 Pt's we used to love you."
0,I do not eat sushi but all the ladies I was with wanted it - I ordered the teriyaki chicken and a side of rice and a drink....the price was outrageous! ($52) The chicken was good but not that good!
0,"Complete surprise that they would expect us to pay $20.00 a beer if we are not playing more than $20.00 on the bar top machines. Are they serious ?\nLast time at this gold digging of a bar.... doesn't mean just coz i'm hanging out in the Cosmopolitan, I'm ready to throw $20 bills at you for a beer.....at least give me a lap dance !!!"
1,"I have stayed at many hotels and have to say this is the best so far. Everything has been recently remodeled. The casino is great! Staff is superior, they made me feel special. I would recommend hotel to everyone. To top it off I won a few hundred dollars playing there. I am definitely staying here again on my next visit to vegas."
1,"Cute place!\nBeet salad and corn soup were great! My boyfriend got the egg salad salmon sandwich which was pretty good. \nI asked for an alcoholic version of their lemonade mojito, yum!\nIndie music goin on was fun for a slow lunch day. Hope to come back and try some flatbread and more:)"
0,"I still rate this restaurant a solid three stars for the lasagna or the $10 dinner in general but when it comes to the 'finer\"" dishes ... read on.\n\nI decided to try the Chicken Rollatine this time , mushrooms, prosciutto, Marsala wine etc. Back in the day I would have ordered the veal but I've been dissuaded from eating veal again because of  the way they're treated, downer So chicken it is, but if you are going to sell me  a $17 plate of chicken in a dated, tacky restaurant on East Independence it better be good, real good! \n\nThe service was very attentive and quick, the dinner rolls were very tasty and the glass of house Cabernet was pretty good for the price.  End of the good stuff. \n\nThe blue cheese dressing for the salad was the same generic stuff they serve in cafeterias. definitely unsuitable in a good restaurant and the salad was equally indifferent. The main dish looked absolutely terrific but I couldn't believe what I tasted on the first bite. I stopped, took a second bite to confirm my impression.  \nOther than a faint trace of Marsala the sauce might as well been brown gravy, totally bland, I couldn't taste the mushrooms (because they were the tasteless pre-sliced canned ones) or  Prosciutto  or pepper or capers or rosemary or anything that resembles Italian cuisine! Also they don't offer to grate parmesan or grind fresh pepper over the dish, instead on the table were the same dispensers you find in cheap pizza joints, powdered imitation cheese. \n\nI didn't see the point in ordering a different dish. Instead I asked the waitress to take the plate  back to the kitchen and please use a little more Marsala,, pepper etc. The owner came by and took it to the kitchen. The dish was back 5 minutes later, warmer and with a stronger taste of the wine this time. I poured some more pepper and the taste was now \""acceptable\"". The owner paced the whole time for no good reason and as he sped by me he went \""Good for you now?\"" - a real class act. \n\nI wondered how can they get away with selling food that's so bland but when I looked around I realized that just about every customer was over 65 - well over some of them.  That may help explain it.\n\nMy advice is to stick to the simpler, less expensive items on the menu and don't be fooled into taking Fontanella for a fine restaurant. If I was the manager I would have straighten out that kitchen in a matter of weeks."
0,"We ate there tonight after reading all the yelp reviews.  We were trying to find something better and different than our regular Bellagio.  I was a bit disappointed because most of the items written about and pictured here were not offered. I'm not sure if a limited menu was offered because it was a weeknight.  Weeknight and weekend night prices are the same ($35) so the menus should be comparable.  I was really looking forward to some items other yelp reviewers enjoyed.  Some of the items I noticed were missing from the buffet included: pad thai, sesame chicken, mussels, pork buns (although the guy told me it was a morning menu item), tacos al pastor, macarons (i don't care for them but i know many people love them and they were missing from the buffet), the little painted egg shell dessert cups, fried chicken, sweet potato fries, mac 'n cheese bar, chicken apple sausage, kalbi, head on shrimp (really wanted this one), and many others.  In fact, I didn't think there was anything on the menu worth the $35. The best items were the corn on the cob with cilantro butter and the watermelon w/feta.  I still feel the Bellagio buffet with the Chilean sea bass is a better deal. Plus Bellagio serves several more expensive buffet items and provides a nicer variety.  \n\nI was also pretty annoyed by all the individual dishes and pans.  The pans were bulky and heavy to carry.  At a buffet, I often like to take just a spoonful of a dish to try before fully committing.  Many of the dishes were too much of a commitment.  I wanted to try the pappardelle but I didn't want to take a whole pot of it.  The tables were also too small for so many dishes.  To give the staff credit, they did a great job clearing the tables.   While trying to juggle and arrange everything on the table, I dropped my fork and our server came right over to replace it.  The bottle of water at the table was nice but it was poured into a tiny glass with no ice.  It's August in Vegas and I wanted cold water.  After refusing the bottle of wine, I was surprise the bottle was left on the tiny table, taking up precious table real estate.  \n\nWe wanted to try something new this time around.  We usually eat at an on strip buffet at least once while we visit Vegas because it's not a trip to Vegas without a Vegas buffet.  Our other meals are usually is off the strip. We initially wanted to try the Wynn buffet because we've never tried it but went with Wicked Spoon instead.  I've eaten at Studio B, Spices, Lago, Carnival, Village Seafood, Le Village, and Bellagio.  It seems like I eat at Bellagio at least once every time I'm in Vegas.  (I just ate there two weeks ago when I was last here).  We don't always eat at buffets.  I had a great meal at Social House in the Crystals shopping center and had a great hot dog at Pink's during my last visit but buffets always seems to be the easiest meal option when you're with a larger group or with a picky eater.  I don't eat nearly enough to make buffets worth the price. But I do try to make up for it by eating the more expensive items like seafood or duck.  \n\nThe buffet it not terrible but not great."
0,"4 sales douches meet to have dinner. It is Vegas so it is to be expected that any meal you consume will come complete with a significant price mark up. The waiter, who was a very nice guy came by and offered their Japanese Kobe beef. It sounded delicious until he quoted $35 per oz. PER OUNCE. That is retarded. I lost the game of credit card roulette and had to foot the $335 bill. The food wasn't bad but it was overpriced by roughly $135."
1,Very unique and quite delicious food! We have tried several different entrees and they all are fantastic! Crab Rangoon's are a must here!
0,I was thinking to go this restaurant from long time at last I did dine in last night & we didn't like their food pls don't waste your money..
0,"I popped in for a quick lunch this afternoon to check out Pure Taqueria because I had business to do in the neighborhood and needed a quick bite to eat. Unfortunately, the quality of the food and service don't match the shiny new storefront. I will certainly not be a regular, even if it is just up the road from my house...\n\nUpon arriving, I was seated quickly and ordered a sweet tea as soon as I was seated while I perused the menu. By the time I had ordered and my enchiladas were brought to the table, I still had yet to receive my sweet tea. Although I was pretty parched, I ate a few bites and waited for my server to come check on me...and waited...and waited, until I finally gave up, flagged down a different server and asked yet again. Although my server brought my tea right away, I was still more than halfway through my meal before I even saw it. \n\nAs for the food, I ordered the enchiladas of the day, which were the enchiladas suizas. Although the food was presented well and served very quickly, the enchiladas were relatively flavorless, even with the pico de gallo served on top. The salsa served with their chips - which were oversalted - was actually pretty decent but that's really all I can say for the place. Overall, I was certainly underwhelmed."
1,"This Mexican restaurant is close to my in-laws place so we recommended giving it a try one Sunday after church. We heard this was related to Baja Joe's in Mesa, but it is in fact not. But the menu is almost identical. We have been craving fish tacos, so we ordered the Red Snapper, whole fish,  cooked in garlic.  They have very good quality tortillas I must say. We used the tortillas to make a little burrito with the garlic fish and added the delicious chipotle sauce and habanero hot sauce to give it a good kick. Those were delicious. I must say they could use a reassessment of the salad they serve because they were wilted and just did not look good. The fish was also a bit smaller than I expected considering the price and when compared to Baja Joe's. I also got to try my brother-in-law's shrimp burrito - enchilada style and i must say it was HUGE! Also, they were generous with the perfectly cooked shrimp! My mother-in-law got the carne asada and that was cut pretty thin and wasn't as juicy as I expected, so I don't think I would recommend it. The ambiance of the restaurant is basically as if you walked into Mexico, it compliments the food in my opinion! The service was great, the waitress was very attentive and was very helpful when we had questions, even with a decently packed house. I am definitely planning on coming back for another round, and I'm glad we got to give it a try!"
1,Love the convenience of the redbox and inexpensive products! Staff is always helpful when i go in....
0,"Huge Expectations. Huge disappointment!\nComing from San Francisco, we expected Bouchon in Vegas to have the same quality, flavor and excellence as Keller's Napa outpost. Do not waste your time (should be at the pool, not at a restaurant for hours) or money ($100 for 2 for a dry, lackluster brunch!!!) at Bouchon."
0,"I love Thai food and was looking to add another Thai place to my fav list here in Charlotte.  I stopped here and got two dinners to go.  What a huge disappointment.  The chicken dish I got for my father.. we had to search for quite some time before we were able to find even a small piece of chicken.  And my dish tasted so bad (low quality) that after a few bites I had to throw it out.. and I hate wasting food.\n\nIf I tried the place again, it may get better stars, but unfortunately this experience was so bad, I can't pull myself to give it another try.  Sorry to give a bad review, but it was what it was."
0,"I'm really disappointed in this place. I went on a Tuesday and my waitress was slow and dis organizationed, but that was not the reason for my bad review.  It was the food. It was just bad. We started with brushetta. Kinda tastless. Dry toast with tomatoes covered in cheese. Then dinner; I had the lasagna.  Mostly bland sauce and noodles,  some sausage and a touch of ricotta cheese, clearly a couple of days old reheated with cheap mozzarella cheese on top. Asked for bread, it was re heated to ye point it was burnt and dry. My dates food was just as bad...."
1,"Two words: Adobada Torta. If you have not tried Phat Phranks, it is imperative that you do so ASAP! The chile verde burrito is also wonderful - a little spice, and lots of flavor! The fish tacos are to die for, and if you like authentic Mexican So-Cal style, this is the place to go. \n\nBesides having a small-town Restaraunt atmosphere in a big city, Frank seriously makes every guest feel welcome. If it isn't right, he will make it right immediately. It's always refreshing to see the owner working behind the counter, ensuring everything is just right for his guests."
0,i will only give it 2 stars b/c the dj for karoake was awesome and the food was good. on the negatives-some of the worst service i've ever had and i've been to a lot of bars/restaurants. the server repeatedly forgot my tables drinks. at one point i just went up to the bar to get a refill-it was so much quicker. my fiance went to get my one drink that was sitting at the bar for 10 minutes when she saw that she got it and gave it to me saying there was computer problems-hmm yea right. i had to ask for my check twice because i was waiting for 20 minutes for it. just terrible and i could on but i'll spare you. trust me i was a server for years so i understand getting slammed but it wasn't busy and she should've asked for help and not made up that there was computer problems. also i got a mixed drink and so did my friend and it didn't taste like any alcohol. despite all this my friends and i still had a really good time b/c of karoake. still don't think ill be back there anytime soon.
1,"Watch out when your around the area! Asians can't drive worth for SHHHHH&&^! lol! It's true I myself catch myself not paying attention sometimes! Sorry to the lady I almost hit! LOL!\n\nThis place is located on Spring Mountain, Chinatown area. This plaza has all the restaurants, boba tea, novelty gifts, dessert places, massage parlors, asian grocery. Heck this place reminds me of china sometimes with all the rude asians pushing and shoving not saying excuse me! But oh wells! Im still a fan because you can find pretty much everything that is asian related in the area.. I was looking for Bird's nest soup and they have an herbal store located in this plaza which has the bird's nest soup.. ( good for the skin by the way).. I usually hit this place up when im looking for medicinal items like the white flower liquid that helps me breathe during allergy season or my green tea, and I mean the real deal straight from the tree green tea.. Also, when i didn't like the layout of my unit in my apartment I had to look for Trinity Coins to block out my roommates negative energy, long and be hold this plaza had trinity coins located inside their Chinatown shopping mall.\n\nOverall I've been coming here since i was in high school, You will find all the asian remedies, foods and novelty items here at this plaza."
0,"I wanted to talk with this gym about membership options, but due to a tight schedule, was only able to talk by phone. \n\nI was told that was impossible, and that if I wasn't \""willing\"" to come to the gym for the hard sell, then I clearly wasn't committed enough to my fitness goals.\n\nWhat a way to guarantee no-sale! It is nice to know right away that everyone is just a number, a body to them. If they treat me so poorly when they WANT my money, I can only imagine what the \""service\"" is like once they've got it. \n\nNo thanks, Gold's. I deserve better."
1,The 45mins wait for crispy duck on panang curry was well worth it. Must try! A reservation is highly recommended.
0,went here for an oil change because I had one of those free oil change stickers. guy comes out tells me I need a new cabin filter which he said was $30 free labor. i checked online afterwards and it is $10. Then he recommended to change the serpentine belt. His quote was $200.  I refused. Then after I left he recommended to clean out the catalytic converter. I just bought the serp belt at OReilly for $35 and my mechanic changed it in 5-10 minutes. Charged me $20 for labor. Don't go here. These grease monkeys will rip you off.
1,"I just had the most refreshing lunch at Essence Bakery.  I don't know why I waited so long to try it, but I'm so glad I finally did.  Absolutely crave-able!\n\nI had the Mediterranean Platter.  The grape leaves were so delicious and I really liked the current and pine nut twist in theirs.  The  hummus and bread were top notch as well and the Greek salad was perfectly zesty.  Seriously, the Mediterranean Platter isn't exactly fancy, but it is so good and very satisfying if you aren't looking to stuff yourself.  The ingredients were fresh and had the best flavor.  I also ordered a side of the Spanakopita because I was indeed looking to stuff myself!  Not a fan, I wouldn't order it again.  It tasted too much like quiche and I don't really love quiche.  It was also a bit soggy for my taste.  That is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5, I wish I could give it 4.5.  My coworker had the Ham, Cheese & Jalape\u00f1o Croque-Monsieur and that looked delicious, I will have to get that next time. \n\nTo finish it off, I had to get dessert.  I couldn't pass up their box of miniature treats.  All delicious, this is a MUST.  The macaroon was to die for and I thought I hated macaroons."
0,"I had dinner here on a Friday night a week or two ago and was seriously underwhelmed, which is not what I'd want to be on a Friday night in Vegas. \nI remember the views are great.\nI remember I had a wonderful dinner companion.\nI remember the waitress was very adept at recommending the priciest items on the menu and was wearing a beautifully bright red lipstick.\nBut I can not remember what we had for dinner even if I try really, really hard. It was Friday, so I likely had fish. Yes, it was almost definitely fish. The blandest, most unremarkable fish I've had for a long time. We also had oysters. The blandest, most unremarkable oysters we had for a long time.\nI'm a bit disappointed that Comme \u00c7a didn't work out as other restaurants at the Cosmopolitan are excellent/above average."
0,"Get your wallet ready, the prices are crazy high!"
1,"Me and my wife (both chefs) stopped in for a date night.  We wanted something a little different and not from a chain restaurant.  We started off with fried pickles, my wife is a huge fan of pickles but, gasp, had never had them fried.  They were an amazing start to our meal.  She chose a muffaletta with cajun chips for her entree.  The chips with cut thick, which is rare to find, but delicious.  The meat on the sandwich was great and the actual mix was so good, I could have eaten it on damn near anything.  I had the two meat plate with alligator and shrimp, the alligator had good flavor but was a little bit chewy.  The shrimp were perfect; not too much breading and cooked perfectly.  \nThe staff was so friendly and explained all of their sauces and were everything you would want from food service staff.  The plus about it is the fact that it is a locally owned, family owned restaurant.  We're already spreading the word."
1,I bought a LivingSocial deal for Bon Chef Cafe because it's close to home and I thought it would be a good place to try for breakfast.  We ended up getting there later then planned so we had lunch instead of breakfast - although they do offer breakfast all day. \n\nWe started with the hummus and it was fantastic!  I would go back just for the hummus alone.  For our main dishes I had a chef salad and my boyfriend had a chicken ceasar wrap.  Both we're delicious and the wrap was huge and could have easily fed both of us.\n\nWe definitely plan to go back again for breakfast or one of their 5 course brunches.
1,Hot and sour soup was amazing. Loved the atmosphere. I will definitely be back to work my way through the entire menu. Welcome to the neighborhood. A great addition.
1,"I'm from Hawaii, where eating Japanese cuisine is part of my everyday. Truthfully, I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to a Japanese restaurant while on a vacation, but the boyfriend wanted to...and I owed him for so willingly accompanying me to the Celine Dion concert. \n\nHyakumi was an unexpected delight. We easily made reservations in the morning and ate dinner at around 6.  \n\nThe service was attentive but it was the food that left me satisfied. We split a hibachi order with sushi on the side. The meat was flavored simply and was very tender - though overcooked for our order of medium rare. I hate meat that is flavored so much that you can't taste that you are eating beef.\n\nThe sushi was among the best I've ever had. The ahi (tuna) went down so smoothly that I had to eat several more pieces to confirm that I was eating such heavenly food. \n\nOverall, I'd go again."
0,I had your fried chicken sandwich at the airport.  Needs some work.  Next time I'll try the beef you advertise.
1,"The place is very neighborhood friendly place. There were some stuff on sale in the front part of the cafe, and the waitresses are very busy. We ordered veggie omelet and a skillet, and they were both amazing. The omelet was very good in portion and quality (4 eggs ones oh yeah), and the skillet was just amazing. Based on their prize, they were definitely worth going back again."
0,"The beer was pretty good, but the food was a real disappointment.\nI have always enjoyed the beer at Rock Bottom and miss their location in Atlanta (Buckhead).\nWe sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp.\nI had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine, but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy, but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough, but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables."
1,"The only place I'll buy my pet supplies from!  I'm always more than happy to buy from local places, but this one has the most friendly, laid-back employees I've ever seen.  They're not even more expensive!"
1,"I stayed here for my birthday weekend.  I received a great rate of $29 a night. The room was in the courtyard. Upon arrival I asked for birthday freebies. The clerk upgraded me to the tower suite. The room was great. The bed was comfortable, big flat screen tv, bathroom was huge with two sinks. One inside the bathroom. The other right outside the door. I didn't spend anytime in their casino or restaurants. I most definitely would stay again."
0,"The only good parts are that the bathroom has hot water and you get a free drink when you get a roll of quarters. Unfortunately you need a code to get in and it has no soap, toilet paper or towel/dryer and it's painted black. It isn't that dirty except for the bathroom sink. It's more expensive than the others I've been to in the area. They have 3 TVs all showing the same thing and won't change one even if no one is watching any of them."
1,Very satisfied customer so far. The food is great and the service is exceptional. Special thanks to the owner for my free tea!
0,"Poor customer service, and poor consignment policy.   Had a very expensive purse that they would not give back to me...."
1,"I've gotta say that I'm going to be tough on this place, because I loved and miss Dragon Island, and consider the owner a friend.  However, I'm happy to say that the food is, as previously mentioned, more or less the same (the barbecue pork with snow peas was good, though the sauce was thicker; the egg-drop soup was good, but also had more egg in it than before, and both of these things are fine).  I'll be back for more!"
1,"Just fabulous! Definitely  in my list. My husband brought me here for our 3rd year anniversary and this place is just perfect! We had their tasting menu with 6 courses not including the chef's choice of soup. We started with the Ruinart Champagne with our seat right next to the window overlooking the dancing fountain. The highlight of my dinner was the foie gras although everything was great too.  Service is spot on and ambiance is perfect with intimate small amount of tables. Great food with wide selections of wines, great service, and fabulous view."
1,"I love the food, if only they were better at getting the order right. They consistently prepare orders incorrectly & it becomes frustrating when they get annoyed. They are also frequently out of popular items. At 12, they should have a good stock of bagels for the lunch crowd."
1,"My goal is to try a bookmark each week so I picked this at random and off we went for dinner. \n\nWe decided to split some things. \n\n10piece kushiage - It's chef's choice and we ended up with : \nCheese, shitake mushoom, sweet onion, beef filet, chicken meatball, lotus root w/ curry flavored chicken, squid leg,asparagus, shrimp, pork loin. Out of curiosity, I wondered if this was a better deal at $14 or to pick your own and it ended up being $14.75 worth so next time I'm just gonna go a la carte since I could have done without some of these. \n\nThe texture of the fry was good, but some of the items the differences blended. I generally found I preferred vegetables, and I also liked the chicken meatball and the lotus root w/ chicken best.\n\nThey have various sauces you can choose from, but by default you will get curry salt, chili/ichimi salt and kushiage sauce (which is worcestershire like). I also tried the spicy mayo which was surprisingly tangy and not what I thought it would taste like. I also got ponzu with radish since I just love that on everything and am sad that most places do not put radish is tempura sauce anymore. I got a bowl of rice to go with our kushi.\n\nWe also got udon curry.which had bits of chicken and carrots in it. The udon was cooked pretty well and the curry was good, it was more on the spice side than sweet. \n\nAfter eating all this it seemed like we needed still a little something so we ordered bacon wrapped cheese and avocado. I was a fan of the avocado. \n\nOur server was friendly and checked up on us frequently and kept water filled. Food came to the table fast and came hot. Got our check and was able to pay quickly. \n\nIt's probably a 3.5 but I'll bump it up. I think you should order more of the sizable plates and supplement it with some kushiage than relying on that alone to get full since it's not uber filling, just snackable. Also if you have too many, it just blends to be too much fried items. For me, I'll come back for the veggies and the chicken and lotus and try out some of the lunch combos."
0,"We ordered the escargots au gratin, which were pretty good, but the pasta, lasagna and pizza were awful, they had too much raw tomato taste, the lasagna tasted like those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store (not good at all) and the pizza also looked like a mini frozen pizza with black-burnt edges and 3 strips of fresh peppers added to it. We felt sick after and it was only made worse when we got the expensive bill and were reminded that we didn't just have to regret eating the food but now we had to pay a pricy bill. I would NOT recommend eating here unless you just want to try the escargots. I almost wish that I had had the nerve to tell them that we didn't like it and return the food instead of politely eating it."
1,"It is offical, I have been converted to the Retro style of making AWESOME CUPCAKES!\n\nHoly sheep these people put a lot of frosting on their cupcakes- but it is SO good! And their toppings make you want to smash your face into a wall, it's so cool.\n\nI tried the Cotton Candy cupcake which is a vanilla cake with, DUH, cotton candy pink frosting on tip and GLITTER!! Screw carnivals, if I need a cotton candy fix I'm going here. \n\nTheir prices are at this moment a bit lower than some other places- and they make cakes. Awesome. Cakes."
0,"Here for the weekend and was told i had to try this place out.  The Pittsburger cheese steak was pretty bland.  Unseasoned beef, dry fries, mediocre slaw, and white bread.\nHopefully Pittsburgh has some better \""must eat\"" places."
1,"I recently bought a new Odyssey and dealt with Obi Davis.  He was upfront and honest with us and the process was pretty painless as far as car deals go.  I had another experience late last year with a salesman who was just plain awful.  No tack, and I felt I was talking down to me due to the fact that I was a woman.  The normal dealer \""tricks\"" and lies do not work with my  husband or I.  We do TONS of research and know the games dealers play.  We did our deal no including a trade in because we know how dealers like to play with numbers to make you think you are getting a great deal.  When we picked up the van we talked about the trade in and couldn't come to an agreement which we already knew since the dealer won't give you anything close to what the car is worth.  And if they do, they are playing with the price of the car you are purchasing somehow.  I took off a star because their play area is pathetic.  I am sure Findlay isn't hurting for money at all, couldn't they have something a tad bit better?  I have taken my Accord in for service here on previous occasions and all of those experiences have been good.  I do have to disagree with the price they charge to change an air filter though, it is so expensive and cannot be that labor intensive.  All in all a good experience."
0,"We decided to sit at the bar and have our dinner there so we could listen to the piano player.  We waited a very long time to place a drink order, while watching the bartender stand and converse with other patrons. Then, it was an even longer wait to order dinner.  (empty tables all over, so it wasn't due to being busy)  We weren't sure who was supposed to be taking care of us, the bartender or a waitress.   The bartender took our drink order after a long wait, and then after that, finally a waitress came by as asked,  \""I guess you want to hear our specials?\""  She took our order and we never saw her again.  Water came half way through our meal from the bartender.  Our empty plates sat on our table for 25 minutes.  We felt very unattended to and almost a bother to the staff.  The food is excellent, however, and that just makes it tolerable to go there.  It is not an inexpensive place to eat, and it feels like a place where you should have excellent service.  I got tired of trying to flag someone down all evening."
1,"Excellent gym that has everything I need. Plenty of machines, hot tub, showers and a locker. Downside is they close at 9pm on Saturdays and Sundays.  Not quite 24 hours but otherwise perfect."
0,"Overall, my pedicure was fine.  But a word of advice: if a customer requests nail art, and you cannot do it, please just be honest.  The nail tech asked me how I liked her \""art\"" and I was honest with her and said I didn't really care for it.  I wasn't rude about it, but I didn't want to just suck it up.  She got totally offended and started talking to herself out loud (in another language), but she didn't re-do it.  So in the end, I sucked it up.  I'm so frustrated.  And now I need to find another salon to get a new polish.  Sans nail art, which makes me sad because I really love it when it's done well.  Come on, Vegas!!!  You're better than this!!!"
1,"stopped in before a movie, had 25 minutes to eat and get out of there. Server was great he brought us everything we needed and was professional about it. Beer was nice and cold and food was above par. All said and done made it to the movie right on time."
1,"Great location, great atmosphere. Went last year for a birthday and plan on going there again.. Staff was very knowledgable regarding the menu."
1,"This was my first time visiting Stephano's. They have been open for about 1 1/2 months.  Small restaurant but could seat about 40 - 50 comfortably.  The restaurant was about 75% full with a good stream of people ordering to-go.  The layout flowed well and they had a open kitchen to the dining room only separated by plexiglass.  Service was great!!  Young lady at the register was friendly and provided suggestions for a 1st timer.  The food was pretty good.  I got the chicken gyro wrap and a shrimp skewer.  Food can out in about 12 minutes with a busy restaurant.  There were 2 cooks, expo/food runner and cashier.  Well staffed for the size of the restaurant.  I would definitely recommend to try this place if you like Greek and Mediterranean food."
1,"We went to Scottsdale for Spring Training a few weeks ago.  We saw they had the Giants flags outside so we went in to have dinner.   The service was great from the lady at the first door to the lady who wanted on us.   We decided to have the \""Animal Fries\"" and it ended up being all we could eat.  They were great but the BBQ sauce was a little hot and burned my lips.  But it was worth it. Sooooooooo Good.  The only thing they couldn't do was do a virgin drink for us so we ended up have diet coke with cherry favor in it.  But all in all it was a great time and I would go back."
1,Very good!!!  Very large selection and service was really good too.\nWill return. The Mirage is looking good these days.
0,"After moving to Maricopa a month ago we finally decided to try the sunrise cafe for lunch. The atmosphere was ok and the staff was friendly enough. I had the ruben sandwich and my husband had the bacon and swiss burger. The wait for our food was a bit long, longer then you'd expect for two sandwiches and some fries. The fries were cold, over cooked, and had zero seasoning. My ruben really should have had double the amount of corn beef on it. I was very surprised at how little they put on. Also, no coarse mustard!!?!? How can you serve corned beef and not have coarse mustard to offer guests? My husband's burger was cooked to the temperature he liked, however, he said it was very bland. Again, no seasoning on anything. Also some of the staff tend to like to have personal, non work related conversations right in front of guests. It was inappropriate. As we were finishing up I was watching a server refill the sugars and ketchup bottles. They keep all of their packets of sugars in these old filthy buckets and then place them on your table top but don't wipe the tables off afterwards. Refilling ketchup bottles didn't seem any cleaner as they were pouring it from an old, dingy, plastic, pitcher. Those two things kind of grossed me out. Granted I'm a bit of a clean freak but still if you're going to do these things in front of customers at least make it look more presentable. Also wish the staff were a bit more respectful I'm not your hun nor your sweetie and don't really care for people who call people that. Anyhow, we might be back to try breakfast but if that goes the way our lunch did, we wouldn't come back."
0,Stayed here February 16 thru 20 2012 ...was upgraded to a two room suite due to my diamond status...the original charge was to be 129.00 but they charged me 149.00 due to the upgrade..That was BS since they did the upgrade without me asking for it...the room was so so.. The kitchen was small no measuring cups for cooking...needs more utensils...the staff had no clue how to answer the questions asked them.  Tim the manager was terrible and tried to tell me that the room was discounted to 149.00 but I never asked for it..they over booked not my problem..will never stay here again..
0,"I'll give half star if I can. LOVE is my third Cirque du Soleil show. I've seen KA and O. LOVE is definitely the worst one I've ever seen so far. My husband and I spent $126 per person to get the front row seat. The show is soooooooo boring and my husband fell asleep during the show. The music is re-mixed and just way too loud. Sometimes I can't hear what they sing clearly. The dancing was not bad. I guess if you are the Beatles fan, you'll enjoy the show much more. If you are not the big fan of Beatles, then just buy a CD would be totally enough. Do not waste your time and money for the show."
1,"The first time I saw this group, I was on a Cruise Ship!    I was intrigued by the type of group they were, singing a cappella with no background music.   Wow, is all I can say!   They are the type of group you would expect to see in a very expensive, large show room.   I was determined to see them in Vegas at the LVH when I returned home.  Last night, I did just that and I was not disappointed.  :)\n\nVegas has all kinds of shows available from the Comedian, ventriloquist, to the girlie shows.   This show STANDS OUT as a real crowd pleaser and good for families as well!    The price is very reasonable and the LVH Shimmer Cabaret is a nice intimate venue to showcase this very talented group!  Their performance is nothing short of spectacular.\n\nOne thing that really is a nice touch - each of the individuals in the group come out to the front of the show room to take photos and talk with the audience when the performance is over.   Of course, buying their CDs and Videos are available too.\n\nI should say that when a group like this gets 5 stars consistently, you should run, not walk to buy tickets!  Cost is very reasonable for a Las Vegas show.   If you love music, you will love MO5AiC!!"
1,"My husband and I checked out Yelp for a sushi restaurant, and Kawaii JC had the best recent reviews, even though it was a bit of a drive.  We got here at 5:30pm for the happy hour, and got two 99 cent appetizers with drinks.  We ordered a fried roll, a chef's roll and a regular (free)- all were great!  We're definitely coming back!"
0,"The people of Walmart buffet!  An endless parade of oversized people serving themselves oversized portions of unhealthy, poor quality, poorly prepared food.  The ambiance matched Walmart including the Degrazia Babies with dirty snot stained faces running around in bare feet with a diaper swaying between their knees overfilled with urine. Cheesy music is regularly interrupted with a PA system of management barking orders at the employees. Dirty floors and greasy food encrusted black stained carpets. Wall to wall horrible."
1,"Really a nice little find. Four stars for the gyro dinner, veggie plate and greek salad. They were all really good and the price is definitely right. i will definitely be back here again!"
1,Mom and I went to get facials and found this place through Yelp.  We both absolutely loved our facials with Alicia Szolowics.  I'd say it was the best facial I had.  I'll definetly go back when I'm in town again. I'd like to try the dermabrasion.
1,"We had some minor repair work to fix a leak in our clay tile roof. I called Johnson Roofing and Tyler Johnson called me back and we made an appointment for him to come see the roof the same day. He climbed on to the roof, assessed the problem  and gave me a preliminary idea of the damage, the solution and the cost to fix it., which he followed up with a written estimate. They came to do the work two days later, were at my house for about 4 hours, fixed the roof and cleaned up after themselves. Outstanding!"
1,"Great atmosphere, food and staff!!! The restaurant is at what used to be an old home and has a lovely outdoor seating area with cafe lights and landscape. Perfect place to cozy up with a cup of joe and great food. There are also some rescue birds that you can walk around and see after your meal. Highly recommend!!!"
1,"My husband and i went there for lunch .This place have a really great food . I order  pork liempo,chicken bbq,macaroni salad and milkshake .,.the pork liempo is pretty good and also the macaroni salad ,the chicken bbq is okay . My husband like the pork liempo  and the macaroni salad  and also there beef bbq .\n\nAnd there milkshake is so delicious ."
1,"Love this place for it's homey feel. Best weekday specials, best karaoke on Thursdays, best bartender on MTuFrSa. Mark is beyond amazing. He talks to you like a friend and treats you like a normal person, no corporate smiles bullshit. Mark is amazing. \n\nTrent is grumpy but we don't hold that against the place."
1,"Good rolls. Nice atmosphere, Sunday football. Great specials, the eel roll and spicy tuna are good but Red Hot Chili Pepper roll is the best there is! Pork egg roll is delish, so is there spicy edamame and Miso is great too. Staff is ok, seating and drinks are pretty good too. Very cool decor. Oh yeah great ginger and blue wasabi :)."
1,On time - big plus - reasonable - bigger plus - and  done efficiently .
0,"Update: I had hoped to speak to corporate about my horrible first visit, and even sent them two messages via their messaging service on their website. Sadly, they have never responded to me nor have they even tried to contact me and find out what happened, unlike other restaurants. So pretty much, this place sucks in both customer service and quality. Take your money somewhere else, and don't bother coming to this place. Go somewhere else where they treat customers like people."
1,"The chick who emailed me to insult me in response to my previous review should be thrilled to know that I had to fly to PHX again yesterday and had a totally different experience - lines were short, security was cool and I was in and out in no time.  Turns out, not so bad at all.\n\nCoincidentally, I flew in on the same day you wrote me to call me a hippie!  So sorry I missed you.  Next time, I'll save up some welfare stamps and treat you to a government sponsored lunch.  It'll be great.\n\nSmooches!"
0,While the hummus plate was ok.  There were flies everywhere - including on the pastries that were laying out today.  Just sitting on the pastries and flying everywhere.  They wouldn't accommodate my friend who wanted her sandwich in a wrap instead - said it would be TWICE as much.  Not enough flavor in the wraps.  We will not be returning :(
1,Great buffalo chicken sandwich.  Buffalo chips are really good. Burgers are always good.  Very consistent with food.
0,"I have travelled to Vegas numerous times and pretty much call Monte Carlo my \""home\"" there but I found a good deal at Luxor so tried it this summer.  It won't happen again.  At check-in, while my room was ready because I had worked through a host, they did NOT have a room for my mother and 2 kids on trip with me.  Her vacation was booked WITH MINE and paid for months before.  They had her reservation....just no ROOM.  After 30+ minutes of searching for a room for her, they found one that would be ready in 30 more minutes.  \n\nIt was 11:30 PM at this point, mind you , and we had been travelling since that AM with 2 kids in tow...but we waited it out in the casino while my boyfriend took the kids up to our room.  The front desk had given him the wrong room ### so as he was trying to access \""our room\"" with the kids, the actual occupant of the room approached him asking why he was trying to get in to his room....\n\nHe called the front desk and finally got into our room with the kids.  After the time passed for mom and the kids room to be ready, we headed over there...ALL the way on the complete other side of the hotel.  We opened up the door - and surprise!!!  Someone was OCCUPYING the room.  Not only was I know much MORE aggravated as it was about 1:30 AM now and we had traipsed from one end of the hotel and back again only to get the wrong room ### and then a room that was NOT EMPTY!  Now I was also uncomfortable with their safety standards at the Luxor.  What if we had not been honest people - the occupants were not in the room - only their stuff was there...we could have cleaned them out!!!!  \n\nFinally at 2 AM, they did finally find a room equivalent to the one I had booked for my mom and kids and we were lucky enough to be on the same floor.  That really set the tone for the entire trip though and while the Luxor did credit back a couple of hundred bucks for the mess up, I would rather have had a smooth start to this vacation.  It wasn't worth the savings or the comp they credited back to us.\n\nThe rooms were incredibly dated and difficult to cool as they still work on the older window type units rather than having a thermostat control anything.  The TVs were small and not flat screens.  The jacuzzi bathtub was broken.  They WERE very spacious and the staff did send up a \""sorry\"" tray of biscotti and desserts, which was a nice gesture - but should have really gone to the room the kids were in, not to our room.    \n\nThe casino was less than friendly, the service at Flight, the bar on the casino floor was incredibly unprofessional....it was just not a good experience overall.  I won't be returning to the Luxor and would not recommend either."
0,Worst place to eat ever! The service gets one star but the food isn't worth it. Only thing good was the salad! Lol not hard to make a salad though.
0,"I have always been a fan of Smashburger but not today.   They must of had their \""B\"" team running things today.  My daughters kids meal (grilled cheese) came after we had gotten our food.  The sandwiched was \""grilled \""  but the cheese was not melted.  Also with kids meals now if you want milk or juice they charge you extra.  \nTheir soda machine did not seem to be working properly either or was not cleaned properly.  We tried the coke, diet coke and coke zero and each one of them had a musty taste to it.  The soda was not drinkable.  We informed the girl who took our order ( she was wearing a badge that said certified trainer)  and said she would tell a manager.  Manager never came over to the table nor were we offered anything else to drink.  We basically had to throw our drinks away. ($5.00).  Very disappointed!!"
1,"A lot of people ask me \""hey mike, what is a traditional korean dessert?\"" I would tell them it is paht-bing-soo. (red bean on shaved ice with fruits top with a sweetened condensed milk, and other toppings). The next question they usually ask me is \""Can I find this dessert in Vegas?\"" The answer is \""yes\"". While many other korean restaurants and coffee shops and bakeries offer this, I tried them all and none of them compare to the one at Crown Bakery. This place offers the right amount of sweetness and fruits. It's very refreshing. Make sure you order it when one of the girls are working the counter, they'll give you a big mound of ice and put mochi in it. The guy, if he's there, is a little stingy. That's why they get 4 stars today. Also, im kind of a traditionalist when it comes to this dessert so I like mung bean or soybean powder on mine. But that's my personal opinion. They have amazing breads and cakes there as well, much better than l'epidor in my opinion. But this hidden gem is the paht-bing-soo. Ch-ch-check it out!!"
1,"This is my go to Thai food restaurant.  They have a great variety on their menu.  I personally almost always go for the curry squash but also love their pad thai and panang.  My dad always gets a different spicy dish with seafood, and he loves it too.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful.  They are also quick."
1,We were staying at the MGM but decided to take a drive and try this place. We had no regrets. We and the kids loved the food.
0,"This was yet another stop on what turned into our Fall Break Tour of Phoenix Magazine's Best New Restaurants of 2009.  Unfortunately, I disagreed with Phoenix Magazine again.  It was lunchtime and we had been doing a lot of shopping, so the husband and I had worked up quite the appetite.  We didn't realize that America's was going to be more like appetizer sized food that comes out in entree time.  We waited in line for about 5 minutes or so, I looked at the menu and decided to go basic with a bean and cheese burrito.  It sounded really good at the time.  We ordered and then sat down and waited.  \n\nAnd waited, and waited, and waited.  Ugh!  But wait, the husband's food came out first.  Almost an entire five minute before mine.  His meal was so small he was pretty much finished by the time I got my burrito.  My burrito was really blah.  I think it's cool that they don't cook the beans with lard, but apparently that translates into a complete and utter lack of flavor.  Same goes for the cheese.  I had no idea any was even in there.  So, I left hungry and unhappy with a nasty bean film in my mouth.  I won't be back."
0,"I frequent this establishment and generally ignore the poor service, but after my latest encounter they have lost me as a customer. I waited 30 min to even be acknowledged only to have longer waits for food and drinks. I have never had worse service."
1,Best place for breakfast in Las Vegas. The mimosas are great and the food is good and you get huge portions. The wait can be long sometimes but if you go early it's not too bad.
1,"This is a great steakhouse tucked away just off 215 on the north side of town. It isn't extravagant or expensive... just really stinking good. Their steaks are high quality and cooked perfectly. They have an excellent wine list that isn't overpriced. No need to get dressed up to eat here, but you can if you want. Make sure to get the ranch house potatoes as your side. Delicous!"
1,"Great lunch special! \n\nI was excited for the opening of this place, and was not let down. All in all it really is just a very standard chinese restaurant, but it is very tasty. I have tried the orange chicken and lemon chicken for the lunch special and both were good. I requested Orange beef on the special , but they would not do it. Which to me is confusing because they have beef plates, and orange chicken on the special. Why not combine them? That so far has been my only disappointment. I also really enjoy the chow-mein.\n\nThe staff has been very nice so far. I will say that there is an older gentleman who worked there that has been there both times that I have visited that was very awkward. He just sat across the room from us with his head in his hands looking angry. SOO I dont know whats up with that, but ohwell. \n\nThey are not quite 5 star. Nothing out of the ordinary for a chinese place. It is still a great place to get lunch or dinner though."
1,"This is a great option if you just want to grab a good lunch at Kierland without mortgaging your house. Its essentially the non-chain answer to Paradise Bakery. The restaraunt was clean and inviting. My wife had the Chef's salad which was large and had lots of meats and cheeses. I had the \""American Grilled Cheese.\"". The tomatoes were fresh and ripe and the bacon was thick and cooked properly. You can also get an ice cold beer if you want. There are also some great specialty sodas available.\n\nI would go back for lunch and I reccomend this place for anyone who doesn't want to break the bank for lunch at Kierland."
1,try the pizza regina. Delicious. It comes with ham and mushrooms.. the ham thats on the pizza was thin cut and delicious it just melted in our mouths =) waiter was so polite and professional. Def. next time I come to vegas I will be eating at suede =)
0,"Unfortunately I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  The Doctor was great but dealing with the front desk staff is so difficult I left and went to another practice.  They give phone messages, return phone calls, spell your name right on documents so your prescriptions aren't right... 3 strikes and you're out!  Bummer."
1,"I came back here from a long hiatus (not that I was after a regular but after an unfortunate incident in which an intoxicated associate got us kicked out of the bar, we'd been reluctant to show our faces). That being said, I really could take it or leave it because my other experiences here have been fun but nothing to write home about (except the night that we got kicked out).\nHowever I stopped in last Saturday (admittedly we were already happily buzzed) and I had a great time. Good music and the crowd in particular was fun and not too pretentious so I had a blast. Of course there's a good chance that I was probably more than happily buzzed and was too intoxicated to give two craps about the crowd one way or the other.\nJacob P. gives some good advice on how to have a good time. My other suggestion is to come here after you've already gotten shitfaced at another bar (or three) and wrap up here. It worked for me."
0,"Cox cable and Internet services may not be the best choice when you have options. \n\nThe company is large and they like to use that size to bully more than for improvement of service and services. \n\nI have been a loyal customer for many, many years and year after year my bills change without cause, they like to play up sell games, and even force you to take services you do not need, all in the name of savings. Don't be fooled as the savings are always temporary and in the end you always pay.\n\nThis company could be great, increase customer count and be the leader, but they choose to prey on unsuspecting customers, be overbearing in forcing staff to oversell and leave customers disheartened, and worse play the pricing games.\n\nThe people are good, the process is broken and inconsistent and the product is in demand. A simple fix could turn this company's rating the right direction, but only time will tell as technologies change who the winners and losers will ultimately be."
0,"The guy at the front desk was SO rude when we checked in.  Not a great way to start.\n\nWe booked online and when we showed up they charged us an additional fee that wasn't mentioned before.  Not cool.\n\nThe beds are TINY.  My boyfriend is 6'3\"" and his shins and feet were hanging off the bed.  Not comfy.\n\nThe ceilings in the rooms are really low.  Random, I know, but it feels like you just walked into a miniature hotel room.\n\nThey give you coupons for a couple of on-site restaurants/bars, but when you try to use them you get attitude from the people working at the restaurants/bars and they come up with all kinds of restrictions that weren't mentioned before.  What's the point of a coupon if all it gets you is a cup of ice?\n\nPerks: Easy self-parking and somewhat low rates (even when the unexpected additional fees are added)."
0,"After realizing that every other restaurant at the TI was a walk-up, take-out, [late lunch time] we opted to sit down at the buffet restaurant. \nBoring and mediocre, if I hadn't been starving I might have been offended."
1,"We were here for a post rehearsal dinner party, great beer, delish mixed drinks, great for groups."
0,"After trying this place for the first time last year when I was in Phoenix and having a wonderful experience, I went back there today and was absolutely disgusted.  As we approached the front door a friend said he thought it looked closed, but it turned out it was open there just weren't any people inside.  \n\nThe place smelled like a sewage plant on the inside, and we immediately turned around and went elsewhere for food.  Luckily my friend said a new Ramiros opened near his house, because I will definitely never go back to this location again."
0,"Not the greatest Mexican food.   Definitely overpriced for the quality of food served.    I ordered the \""enchiladas\"" and I didn't think they were very good.  They seemed to be a bit tough when I tried to cut in half.  I didn't really think you could screw up rice and beans...you can actually screw up rice and beans.  \n\nI'm sure you can find cheaper and inexpensive Mexican food off of the strip."
1,"I love this place nice and clean ,service is very good ,the food fresh to cook I order lunch special only $ 5.95 and new york egg roll $1.95 I had free sodathey give a lot food and very tasty ,egg roll is the best I never had in las vegasI will come back with my friend"
0,"Came here a few times very early in the morning after work. \n\nAt that location were almost no customers during my few visits around that time. \n\nWith that being said, the service was fast. \n\nYet, to me, the food seemed good, but it isn't all that great. I ordered from the breakfast menu. \n\nThe deserts were also not that great, like the milk shake, it tasted more like a \""water-shake\"" then rather creamy. \n\nIt's a nice spot to go to around here, because nothing is really open overnight or very early in the morning. \n\nGreat and fast service, however."
1,"Always on the hunt for a top notch Latin grill. Sabor exceeds that expectation. First off, it is located in a chic little urban scale building in the Elizabeth area. The decor is cool, funky, and Latin - not at all the typical Mexican-american restaurant. They use an open kitchen design where you can see and smell all the goodness. And certainly it is important to note the attentive, friendly staff. I admitted to being a newbie with my yelp open and in hand, and they were excited to bring on a new follower.\n\nOkay, now for the food. Ordered 2 tacos, 1 chicken 1 fish, both authentic. Outstanding, fresh, nothing else needed to say. Also ordered a large guacamole and cashed in on the free chips with the Yelp check in. The guac was clearly fresh and homemade. Top notch. The interesting thing about the chips was that they were tossed in a paprika seasoning. Top notch as well.\n\nGo here now. You will not be disappointed."
1,"The customer service here was so good - it was surreal! And I AM NOT exaggerating!!!\n\nI believe it was Jan who took my call from CA, asking at 5:00pm if they could deliver flowers that same day to family in the Summerlin area. I couldn't believe that 1) she said yes, and 2) she was so nice and patient about making sure everything turned out just the way I wanted, and within my price range. \n\nI wanted a girly-looking arrangement, but I wanted to include something for a little boy as well, so I asked about a teddy bear. She said they didn't have one, but they could go get something that would be suitable. My jaw about hit the floor! Had I suddenly been transported to Mayberry? Now this is a parallel universe that I could get used to! \n\nAt the end of our conversation. I got emotional explaining the \""occasion\"" and dictating a note. It could have been awkward, but Jan was very comforting.\n\nThree hours later... Joy was unable to reach my family on their cell phone to get their gate code. She left me a voicemail while outside the gate, then waited a few minutes until I called her back! Once inside, she realized I hadn't given her a unit number so called me back to get that. I'm guessing it was a total of 15 minutes outside and in the complex before she was able to get to their front door. \n\nI'd think a lot of delivery people would have left, understandably,  given that the customer had given incomplete information.  Not only did Joy put in the extra effort to make the delivery happen that night, she pulled it off without a hint of impatience or frustration in her voice- and I'm sure after a long day of work. Her tone could not have been kinder. I think she and her mom understood the significance of the day for my family, and wanted to make sure they got the items that day. Oh, and they found the cutest little tiger to accompany the flowers!\n\nI read the news and look around me, and am disgusted by the lack of good will, decency, and common courtesy in our society. In my 50 years, things seem to have gone from bad to a lot worse. Even something as simple as a checker at a store who doesn't bother to say hello before taking your money. And then -  a couple of florists remind me that there are still some wonderful, genuinely kind people out there. Thank you, ladies!!!"
1,"I want to preface this review by saying that I'm close friends with one of the sushi chef's in training, so we got a seat right at the sushi bar and really had a great opportunity to chat.  That being said, I will review this strictly on the quality of food, since we received some deep discounts due to being VIP guests.  (C'mon now, you know you all get discounts too when you personally know the staff/chefs, so quit your whinin'!)\n\nThe quality of the fish was excellent... some of the best sushi I've had in my existence.  The key to getting good sushi is to trust in the chef, and ask them what is fresh, and what they would suggest (omakase style).  \n\nWe had a sashimi appetizer platter to start which featured blue fin, yellow tail, o-toro (yes, the good stuff!), and a few other pieces.  Served with fresh wasabi root (not the hydrated green powdery stuff), this appetizer really woke our stomachs and senses.\n\nWe had a few different rolls per the chef's suggestion, and all were spectacular (including some off the menu rolls).  The kim bap roll was highly recommended, and the quality was definitely memorable, better than most Korean-mom kim bop rolls I've had in my life.\n\nWe asked for ama-ebi (sweet shrimp), which was soft, tender, and sweet, with perfectly fried shrimp head to back.  This was the first time I've had such perfectly made ama-ebi, and it's made me want to continue my search in Chicago.\n\nSome tasty mochi desserts, a few bottle of sake, and all in all, it was a very enjoyable night for my compadres and I.  \n\nI'm sorry for those that have found a bad experience at Otaku, as it sounds like most of it is waitstaff issues... but as a sushi fanatic, my advice to you is this:\n\n1.  Don't ask for a table if you're party is smaller than 4... ask for a spot at the sushi counter, because that's how sushi is meant to be served.  Getting to know your chef, the chef getting to know you, having drinks together, etc.  \n\n2.  Ask the chef what he/she recommends.  Not all fish are equally fresh, and the chef will know what's best for the day.  And if you can provide them with your own past experience of what you liked/didn't like, they'll likely craft a sushi experience for you that you'll love.\n\nVerdict:  If only Otaku were in Chicago... I might go broke.  Delicious sushi, and worth a visit!"
1,"Been here a total of 3 times, all for different occasions. Have been satisfied every time. Probably the best Jumbo Lump crab cakes you can find in Pittsburgh. Freshest of fish, one time I got the Halibut with a mandarin orange finish and it tasted really fresh and very well done. Most recently, I ordered the Mahi Mahi with cranberry sauce and it was also very well prepared and tasted awesome. Every time I stop by, the service is impeccable, i'm always surprised at how much the wait staff have memorized for the every changing menu. I definitely recommend ordering some side dishes, you can't go wrong with a few Oysters on a half shell to start and then some Lobster Mac & Cheese to compliment your meal. Finally, they have a great Dessert menu, twice now i've gotten the White Chocolate Macadamia Mousse, honestly there isn't much better you can do to finish off a wonderful meal. Big enough to share with 2 or 3 too."
0,"Will not be going back to this store!!! If all best buys were like this one I would not shop there. The guy who helped us out, Arturo was awesome!! He was a lot of help. However the manger and supervisor (Stephen)  were anything but. We went in to trade in my iPad and buy a new one with a price match from target. They made us jump thru hoops to get the price match. We checked to make sure target had it in stock before we went in. Arturo was told by his manger they called one store that was across the street without us by them to see what store they called. We then had to pull up it online then give them the number to call. We waited around forever. Then the computer broke at check out and again it took the same supervisor to come over to help us. Arturo talked to us and tried to get Stephen to come over. Took forever!!! He is obviously  not worried about customer service. I understand they need to make sure it's in stock but come talk to us. Don't come over with an attitude because you don't want to price match."
1,I went during brunch time since they were advertising free mimosas and missed out on the coveted donuts!\n\nThey gave us apple fritters instead which were perfectly lightly crunchy on the outside and so doughy on the inside filled with apples which were still slightly crunchy and not too sour. It came with an interesting apple paste spread as well as a creamy sauce on the plate which I preferred.\n\nWe also got monkey bread which was so perfectly sticky with a bit of crunchy texture inside. It's a bit on the sweeter side but didn't verge on TOO sweet for me. This was definitely my favorite of the two. \n\nI'd be interested in trying entrees here in the future!
1,"Sunday morning in the casino at the Palms is like being in God's waiting room.  Having said that, it seems that the Palms is either a property with a 3-way split personality or it's having an identity crisis. Or both.\n \nI see 3 distinct things going on here:\n \n They clearly market and cater to the older local population, evidenced by crowds toting the most recent giveaway, which happened to be bathrobes. Yes, bathrobes. Now don't get me wrong, BJ and I have had a lot of fun with this group. In our bathrobes.  (JK)\n \nThe Palms is home to the LV N9NE Group of clubs, which although experiencing a little slippage, are still well above 50% on the hot club scale, not to mention N9NE itself, which is seriously popular with the pre-club crowd.  The Fantasy Tower Suites clearly exist for the young, loaded and hot. (Including Yelper Tony B.)\n \nThe third personality?  There is a daycare.  Seriously, a daycare. Which in my opinion begs the question WHO ACTUALLY PUTS THEIR TINIES THERE? It's conveniently located near the middle-America-esque-mall food court.  One could argue that these things exist to tie in with the locals' marketing.  Ok, I can buy that.  It just all seems so damn disjointed and odd.\n \nSo what were YOU doing there on the aforementioned Sunday morning Liz, you might ask?\nWell, here it is....one of the reasons locals are happy there has to do with the kick-ass video poker.  So, here are the reasons I love the Palms:\n \nKick-ass VP.\nGreat music\nHot cocktail waitresses (I may have mentioned that before...)\nEntertaining, usually drunk parade-o-skanks.\nBen and Jerry's - need I say more?"
0,Didn't know the kids menu was the same as entrees. The Mac n cheese was hardly enough for a small child.  The Bee's Knees beer was lame.
1,"Great pizza and great service. I wouldn't eat inside, the tables are set up too close to each other. They have a great patio if it's not too hot/cold."
1,"Two great comedians performed last night and we laughed our butts off....if you want a drink, don't wait for the only cocktail server, go to the bar in the back.  Great night out...."
0,"We went here for happy hour & before a movie around 4pm on a Sunday, and the hostess  seemed more annoyed to greet us, rather than excited to have guests. \n\nOnce up in the bar, the service was great. The food on the other hand wasn't anything to write home about... The avocado egg rolls were filled w/ just avocado, and no seasoning. The potstickers had pre-cooked crumbly chicken filling inside, rather than being raw & seasoned, before cooking through in the fryer...just a weird way to do it... The sushi was a joke, and shouldn't even be called sushi.. Pass on the wave roll & the  bama roll.\n\nBut really, it's my mistake thinking that i could find good sushi at a place like this. It's built more for ambiance than food quality.  \n\nGreat pl for a drink & non-Asian food..."
1,"Okay, so I go here for beer and socializing. For that this place gets four stars. It is unique, the clientele is .... Interesting, and the beer and wine selection is the best possible within four miles of my house. When I come in here to buy beer(let me know if your experience is similar), I tend to spend 15-20 minutes in the beer aisle, eyes 10 inches from the glass. The salivation and incredible indecision have to make my alcoholism and beer snobbery apparent.  If you like beer and wine and live near this place it should be your go-to \""support a local business\"" place to stock up for your grill out, fancy dinner party, or lonely binge. \n\nOn to the food, though. I don't like it. Maybe it's just not my style but ive eaten here three times and never enjoyed it. Take that with a grain of salt, my friends sing their praises to the high heavens of the deli. \n\nIn summation: buy beer here. Buy wine here. Imbibe in the unique atmosphere, with some unique music, then stroll over to snug harbor for a crowd so unique you won't even think you're still in Charlotte. Try the food, if you like it let me know, I want to find something I like to eat here!"
1,"I gave this place 5 stars, because i honestly believe this is the best buffet/Ayce for the price in Vegas. I have gone to this place for almost 3 years now. The best part about this place are the appetizers. I love the Shrimp on skewers, Rib Eye, Asian Skirt Steak, Ahi Poke, Gyoza, and many more....Over the years their portions have gotten smaller, but i understand because it prevents from wasting food..BTW you can always get more....Their fresh sushi is amazing as well, big pieces of fish with small rice, and their Baked Rolls are very tasty. my favorites is the Lobster Fair and the Paradise rolls. Word of advice try to get there early around 5 for dinner, or you can expect a long wait. Service is really good, and ambiance is great with a younger japanese themed feel....Oyshi is the only reason my wife wants to go to Vegas..."
1,"So. Worth. It.\n\nDefinitely a \""speakeasy\"". Find the staircase and call the phone number. Theyll ask how many you have and what your name is. A word of caution, if you try and bring a larger group here go right when they open. Cuz otherwise youre not getting in. This place in ti-ny and once youre there, youll be there a while.\n\nWe waited about an hour to get in, even w/ a group of 3. There were 2 groups ahead of us.\n\nTheir cocktail menu is impressive. We all had 2 drinks each, all different. Cuz why not right? My friend had a Hummingbird lane (delicious) and a Dolce. The Dolce was her fave. I was lucky enough to snag a sip and man, it was good. Cream cheese foam?! Yes please. Her husband had an Aztec (his fave) and a GI Joe. This is an interesting one. Its green and sparkly. If you like really dirty martinis, youll love this one.I had a Blue Eyed Swizzle (very sweet) and a Fallen Angel (loved it).\n\nThey serve a limited app menu from Citizen downstairs as well.\n\nWe had 6 drinks and 2 apps, and our bill was over $100. Thats the downside, they add gratuity to every drink.\n\nThe mixologists and door man were very, very nice and attentive. It does take about 10 mins per drink to make so yes, you will be here for a while.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this place for a small girls night, date, or otherwise."
1,"I LIKE TALKING MY HUSBAND OUT OF BUYING THINGS HE DOESN'T NEED\n\nSweetheart, you don't need a two-sided quarter. \n\nAfter thoroughly assisting a few other customers, the lone employee was able to come to our section and help us find the quarter my husband wanted to buy. Even though we decided against the purchase (good! he would have lost it anyhow - or spent it!) we did browse the entire store. There was a lot to see, even though it's a small store. It's full from ceiling to floor with little items and games and magic tricks and masks. The clerk was helpful, showing anyone interested in something, precisely how it worked.\n\nI saw one woman very happy with her purchase for her children. He taught her the trick so that she could teach them at home. Cute store with good customer service."
1,"A fun way to spend a few hours with people you like to talk to.

1,"Gorgeous hotel, we were staying i'n a beautiful suit, and we had great time, treated as Queen & King, great service"
0,"This place has a lot of rules:\n1. You cannot wait inside if there are no seats available, even though when you go inside there is plenty of standing space near the ATM.  There is not standing at the bar, or around the tables.\n2. If you have a party more than 4, and you want to split a check per what you ordered, this will not be accommodated.  You will have to split it evenly.  This got very awkward for my group of friends because we all ordered very different things.  Luckily some of our party had cash so the four of us that didn't could pay for what we bought.\n3. They do not take reservations between 4 and 8pm\n4. There is a $10 minimum for a card charge, but luckily the drinks are $9-11 dollars, so you should be ok.\n\nI've been here twice.  Once was on a Thursday around 7pm.  We were told we couldn't have a reservation till after 8.  When I arrived at 7, the place was empty and luckily they sat us.  The second time was last Saturday (labor day weekend) and we were told it was a 2 hour wait for a cocktail... not dinner... so we went to another bar in cityscape.\n\nSo the first time I was able to actually get in was ok.  The drink menu is fun.  Tons of options and there was a fantastic graph on the back to help guide you if you wanted something exciting, sweet, traditional, or savory.  My cocktails were great, no complaints.  I was really excited to have a fun, new, cocktail place in phoenix so things were looking up.\n\nThe food menu has some left to be desired, but if you treat this as a place to get a drink vs. getting dinner, then you'll be fine.  The food was good though, just not a great variety. \n1.  I had the patte with bread, very yummy.\n2.  The Ramen Burger... well that was disappointing.  Yes, it says that there is a lot of sauce on it (\""extra napkins\""), but it really did over power the burger.  I could barely taste the beef or the ramen... really they acted like conduits for the sauce which wasn't that memorable.  \n3. My plain fries, a side that is separate, were really good.  I would like to have a cocktail and these fries every time I come here.\n3.  The loaded friends looked really good and my friends enjoyed them\n\nWe all liked being there, and I wanted to go back and introduce other friends to bitter and twisted (hence last Saturday) but they just make it too hard.  Also considering there is the blue hound, arrogant butcher and squid ink in walking distance (all have great cocktails and food).\n\nI will try to come back again, I just hope they accommodate customers a little better."
0,"really crappy restaurants, nothing for the kids to do and the rooms are very very small. Its right off the freeway. Plus they rolled on OJ. Never had any luck at the machines and the lines are almost always long on Friday & Saturday to cash your checks. The sports book is cool & so is subway. Bingo isnt half bad either. Burger King & the Guadalajara are all gone, the buffet is the worst and the cafe is closing & being replaced by a Denny's. Theres a decent Starbucks on the way out to the parking garage, the Broiler ain't half bad and you can never get a seat at the oyster bar which is the highlight of this place.  Ocassionally a decent giveaway to players club members."
1,pretty good....\n\nFave thing i always get is the Furikake Chicken. \n\nPretty good service and good local vibe of the Restaraunt. Poke pretty expensive but its understandable.\n\nFridays there's usually live music and gets pretty busy so come early.
1,"My mom used to make me care packages with Lee sandwiches. She'd pack up 10 sandwiches, box them up, and send them up with me whenever I went home to visit her. Every time I ate a sandwich, it would remind me of my mom and home. \n\nThese are some of my favorite sandwiches in the world: warm french bread with grilled meats and fresh veggies. Mmm.. I miss you mom!"
1,"This bakery is what I read Yelp reviews for. We're new to Las Vegas, and who has time to go to the dozens of bakeries looking for a winner. There's a reason why this place gets such good ratings. I've had the cupcakes -- chocolate, oreo, salted caramel, marble. Those are really, truly to die for! I have been to cupcake places in other cities, and they can't hold a candle to Drago Sisters. And the other treats -- cannaloni, tarts, European macaroons, mini pies -- were fabulous as well. \n\nIf I was going to look for any possible negative, it is as one commenter said: If you get there later in the day, things may be somewhat picked over. But that's because the word is getting out on these guys. Get there early and pick up the yummies!"
1,"It's been a very long time since BBQ has excited me, Pork on a Fork did that for me !  I like BBQ, but I am picky. I usually dislike the sauce and I love their BBQ sauce.\n\nI found this place through Value Card Alliance Barter Group.  Actually I had to visit a couple times to ensure that the BBQ is consistently good - and it is.  In fact writing this review I find myself jones-ing for it . Their meat is so tender it melts in your mouth. \n\nIf you're in Phoenix, you MUST go here. It is some of the BEST BBQ ever. The cornbread was great. The sides were amazing (mac n' cheese, baked beans, potato salad, and sweet potato fries)! \n\nI had their \""Smokin Sampler\"" with smoked sausage, my wife tried the \""Smokin Sampler\""  with the brisket. The brisket was outstanding! It was simply great - lean and had a nice smokey flavor . \n\nThe food is reasonably priced and EXCELLENT! DELICIOUS BBQ  Honestly can't think of anything negative about this place. Simply said, Pork on a Fork is perfect. PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT! if you even kinda like BBQ, you have to stop in for a meal.\n\nOh yah the service is very friendly too.  \n\nRATING: I highly recommend Pork on a Fork. Why because in short the barbecue is amazing and I have to say they were an unexpected pleasure. To say this place is delicious is a complete understatement . OMG...they are so good eat here or regret that you didn't.\n\nFor me, this is the epitome of the BBQ experience and to be honest, I struggled with the decision of whether to give this place a 4 or a 5 star rating."
0,"I've been eating teppan style cooking on special occasions since around 1980 when Benihana was the only player in town..so I've had a few. Musashi wasn't busy on a week night and there was only 2 tables the whole time we were there so there was a little lack of atmosphere you find in busier places. The whole experience depends on the chef you get. Over the years I've had drunk chefs, chefs that were maybe the first day on the job but for the most part I've had skillful chefs. Our chef admitted up front he was enjoying his day off with some drinks and someone didn't show for work so he was called in. I've been in his boat so could understand. It showed in his juggling with the spatula and fork and when it got to the egg toss it wasn't so good. There were a lot of things lacking like tossing stuff and catching it in his hat or tossing food so you try to catch it in your mouth. I think we got the \"" I shouldn't really be here cooking for you guys\"" show. I ordered a bottle of chilled sake and it showed up in a ceramic sake flask. I've never seen that before. My son worked in a sushi restaurant and any sake showing up in a ceramic flask is the really cheap stuff. The food itself was O.K, perhaps a little overcooked and $3.50 for fried rice which had little else in it a bit overpriced. Musashi does give you extra sauces, chili paste and schriaca if you like spicy and he did make a garlic butter sauce but the presentation was lacking as he only got part of the sauce in the containers. The adult part of the show where he slaps rice into a penis shaped mold was a bit tacky. We were entertaining guests from a small town in the U.K so they probably never noticed it was sub par. Think we're going to stick with Toyko Waco in Los Angeles."
0,"Been here twice and 1st time I order a la carte and it was ok tasting and quality. Second time I went, we ordered the all you can eat menu and literally, we pretty much ate rice. Really tiny pieces of fish you could barely find with all the cucumber and other fillers and the RICE, OMG, so MUCH RICE. anyways, not worth $20 a person."
0,"I made a few trips to this mall during our week in the Phoenix area.  \n\nThe Nike Outlet was great, but otherwise, there weren't that many quality outlet stores.  Most (or so it seemed to me) of the stores in this mall are not outlets and there just weren't the deals that I was expecting."
1,"Very nice people who did an amazing job on two of our computers.  One was the transfer of files from an old computer to a newly purchased one.  The other computer was a laptop that was running very slow.  The laptop is now running great, it's like it is a new computer.  I am already recommending these guys to friends.  They do an amazing job!"
1,Always thought this place would suck monkey choad But it's pretty good. Not amazing but fast simple tasty. I do like most that the bread is very thin overall. I try not to eat much bread as it is so this is a big plus. I got the Italian I'm sure the meat is riddled with nitrates but I would go again if I was desperate enough.
0,"Consistently Inconsistent. \n\nSome days I come here for lunch and think \""WOW, why don't I come here more often\"" and other times, I ponder the greatest question of all, \""Why did I come back?\"" \n\nI love the Forest Mushroom Soup, I think it's fan-freaking-tastic. \nI do not love the bread it comes with, it's often rock hard as if it's been sitting out for days. \n\nI love the fruit salad. \nI do not love that unless you read the whole menu you will never know it comes with yogurt. So if you can't have dairy or you just think it's gross to have yogurt all over your grapes, you won't be pleased. \n\nI love the sweet potato sandwich. \nI hate that it's never the same. Sometimes it's dry, other times there's no fennel. UGH\n\n\nThe folks at the registers are rarely friendly but the folks who package up my lunch incorrectly are usually super nice. It's the little things, like when the cashier asks if I want utensils to go and there aren't any. Or they don't include the banana bread with the fruit salad, sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't."
0,"Be careful about booking the  \""courtyard\"". You might as well book at the Motel 8. Most of these rooms face the parking lot and the freeway. There were many other hotels with decent prices that I wish I would have booked. For the \""MOTEL 8 \"" ATMOSPHERE we could have a had our pick of other hotels for the same price with nicer rooms. Most Importantly if your looking for a bargain the hidden fees at this hotel bump up the price quite a bit making much nicer hotel in Vegas the same price. There is a 16.00 dollar A NIGHT HOTEL SERVICE FEE  that when added to the price of the room, could be applied to a better hotel in Vegas. Also, management did nothing about complaints. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Lastly, pictures of the rooms on the website our not at all what the really look like."
1,Great space. Very dramatic. Food was really good. Potstickers were excellent with a crispy crust. Dynamite chicken was flavorful with the right combination of sweet and spicy.  Service was great. Worth trying. I'd go back
0,"EDIT2: They charged my card AGAIN. I have now been charged four times for a one night stay. I've put a charge block on my card. Here's the saga on Vegas Chatter: http://www.vegaschatter.com/story/2012/9/4/162713/3521/vegas-travel/If+You+Stay+At+Golden+Nugget%2C+Keep+An+Eye+On+Your+Credit+Card+Statements\n\nEDIT: So, I'm fresh back from my stay this weekend and here's the rest of the story.\n\nA representative from The Golden Nugget called me on Friday and explained their billing software was not jiving well with AMEX and that's why the double charge again. He then told me I would receive $300 off the bill when I checked in.\n\nFlash forward to Saturday (my check-in day) - my husband and I check-in with surly employees at the VIP lounge, go upstairs, have a lovely stay in our suite. \n\nThen we checked out this morning and THAT's where the issues come up.\n\nThe employee who checked me out informed me we were booked to stay until 9/3. I replied to her that we had only booked one night. She then said, \""Well, whoever booked this online booked two nights. If you want to check out today there will be a $50 early check-out fee.\""\n\nI simply replied, \""No.\"" She did some typing and then, lo and behold, we didn't have to pay the fee anymore.\n\nI am utterly AGHAST at the amount and degree of billing errors I have experienced in booking one night with The Golden Nugget. From reading other reviews here, I believe this to be a systemic and reoccurring issue in this casino and hotel. \n\nI'll be calling the number of the gentleman who promised me everything would be fine during my stay to alert him to this. Even though I received a reduced rate, I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone give these people their billing information.\n________________________________________ \n\nI wish I could give this hotel NO stars. \n\nThe Golden Nugget has now charged me $530 TWICE for a stay I haven't even HAD yet! Watch your credit card if you decide to give them any of your information. \n\nThe first time was when I originally booked my stay in July. I noticed a duplicate charge on my AMEX and called them about it. I was informed they had double charged almost everyone that day and were working on getting people refunds.\n\nThey did refund me but then...\n\nOn August 27 (two days ago), I received ANOTHER CHARGE for $530 on my AMEX from The Golden Nugget, THIS time it was filed under \""Specialty Retail,\"" which a customer rep told me meant someone had charged my card in one of their shops. I haven't even stayed there yet, so this means someone has either taken down my info and used my card to charge something or they have a dangerous glitch in their accounting system.\n\nI informed them of this and after more than 20 minutes on hold, I received NO apology, no compensation, nothing. They told me I have to talk to their accounting department. The hotel manager (Roxanne Yun) said they could do nothing for me and that she \""had no knowledge\"" of the SECOND duplicate charge on my card.\n\nBasically, they told me since it didn't show up on their screens (which, why would it? It's not attached to my reservation. It's a charge on my card from an unauthorized purchase in the gift shop.) it does not exist to them and they can do nothing for me.\n\nI offered to send them statements, written instructions, etc. and she repeated to me that I would just have to talk to accounting. \n\nAgain, I would not recommend you give these people your credit card information. I'm reporting them to the FTC tomorrow morning."
1,"I always stop by the Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio when I'm in Vegas. Partially for the world's largest chocolate fountain and to have a crepe. Before I returned this time around, I read reviews about the souffl\u00e9 crepe and I'm so glad I stopped by to try it! I got the one with warm berry compote and it was so light and amazingly delicious. I watched as they formed the crepe with ease. Then they took out a large disk of premade custard and wrapped the crepe around it to let it melt. Finally, they put a whopping amount of warm berry on top. I could hardly wait to dig in! The vanilla souffl\u00e9 custard in the middle oozed out and it mellowed the semi tart berry taste. What a perfect combination! I'm definitely getting this again when I come back."
0,Management here must be stupid to remodel a buffet with 20 table. Poor common sense for Harrah's.
0,"I hate to say it but I agree with the other users.  The cupcakes we received from a groupon were very bland, small, and not up to par with grocery store cakes or cupcakes."
1,"Desserts, Chocolate, Pastries, Desserts, Truffles, Tarts, Desserts! OMG This place is my heaven! Definitely not cheap but the things that they are making and selling are out of this world! I tried the chocolate mousse with a dark chocolate ganache and small chocolate crispy balls inside. The mousse was so smooth and the crispy balls gave it a nice crunch. Also tried a dark chocolate raspberry truffle and a tropical jelly chocolate which was pretty much chocolate with a passion fruit jelly inside. Absolutely to die for!"
0,"I've now tried this place several times.    I want to like it, and I rarely write bad reviews, but, UGH!   The cost versus what you get is so out of whack that I'm compelled to write.   \n\nThe food is very HEAVY/greasy, it's expensive ($100.00 for 3 people) for what you get, and the preparation is poor at best.   My friends had the steak and the carne adobada, I the rellenos.   We had the garlic dish, which sadly didn't come before the meal but, rather with it.    But, even that is that wasn't a big deal.   \n\nHowever, sadly, all of us pretty much confirmed that the meals, had we made them at home, we would have tossed and taken the family out.   People seem to want to compare this place with Richardson's due to similar DNA, unfortunately the place is not anywhere near as good as Richardson's was and I can't really put a finger on why.\n\nIf you like heavy, greasy, premium priced food, then this place is for you."
0,"I have visited this store many times looking for just the right piece for my loft. When ready to make a purchase, I found a dining table and chair set that I very much liked and thought would fit nicely with my decor. The table was marked at $2,100.00 but the chairs had no price tags. I asked to speak to the owner so as to negotiate a price for the entire set and was asked to wait, as he was on his way in. I waited for 20 minutes, when he finally showed. When I casually asked if the price included the chairs, the \""gentleman\"" literally laughed at me, turned around, and walked away without saying a word. Humiliated, I followed him into the other room and stated that I should assume that it didn't. His very flippant reply to me was, \""The chairs cost $800 a piece!\""...and proceeded to turn his back on me once again. I had $4,000.00 cash in my pocket that day to make a purchase and he and his business not only lost out that day, but I will never make a purchase from that man if that's the way he's going to treat his customers!"
1,"BY FAR my fave lounge/drinks place.\n\nIt's small, it's intimate, it's NECESSARY (Especially with the plethora of Great Dane type wings and chips and beer places... don't get me wrong, I like a good pale ale as much as the next person.. but I digress)\n\nThe drinks are FANTASTIC.  Please try the pulp fiction, it's by far my fave.\n\nTheir appetizers are THAT.  Appetizers.  I wouldn't go there to eat, I go there to drink, enjoy the company of a few friends, and  generally have a great time.  Thursdays there's live music, usually a guitar player, which always sweetens the night..\n\nI'm SERIOUS on the Pulp Fiction.... You WON'T regret it.\n\nThe price range is higher, because frankly, at the end of the day, YOU WILL have at least 5-6 cocktails.. And enjoy them...   Be prepared!! :)"
1,"The food was awesome and getting everything comped was even better.  WOOHOO!\n\nVoga is the Flamingo's new restaurant.  They've been updating the casino to be more with the times and Voga is a nice new addition.  A hip little bistro where the old Italian restaurant used to be.\n\nThe bruschetta tower, lettuce wraps, and lobster tail were awesome but the best was the dessert.  Fried doughnuts and fried Twinkies with chocolate and marshmallow sauces and a creme brulee trio!  OMG!  The fried Twinkies are like a deep fried menage au trois after going thru a 3 year sexual drought in the mouth.\n\nIt's a total recommend!\n\np.s. -  It's pretty pricey so I recommend you get your Harrah's points racked up to get the meal comped!"
1,"Eating at Benedict's made me feel like having brunch at my favorite aunt's house. The place was homey, the service was warm and the food was comforting. \n\nThe place was small and only had a few small tables. There were some tables outside that offered seating for larger groups. I can easily understand if it would take a while to get a table on a busy day. Good thing (or unfortunately) we got to Benedict's a little past lunch already. We immediately got a table and we were greeted as soon as we went through the door. I don't think they have a lot of servers. Take note of this when you visit this place when it's busy. I would think everyone would scramble to make sure everyone is helped and taken cared of. As I've written, the place felt like home, even my own mom or aunt would have a hard time managing several guest at one time.\n\nThe service was hands-on. The lady who served us during our visit was very warm. She was engaging and very friendly. Again, like what I wrote, she was just like my favorite aunt. I did have some concerns, else I would have rated this with 5 stars. I ordered 3 items from their menu that were not available. Thus, why coming here late might be a disadvantage. They ran out of fruit for the crepe, challah bread for the french toast and avocado for the California eggs Benedict. Would have been nice to try it out. Maybe i'll come in early the next time so I get to try what I want.\n\nThe food that were served to us was very good. Let me correct that, it was very good. It was better than other big time brunch places that I have visited. it was original and full of flavor. We had the Arizona eggs benedict and their egg and bacon croissant sandwich. The croissant sandwich was soft, airy and tasty. The additional kick on the sandwich was the pesto sauce. The egg was cooked nicely and the bacon, though not as crispy as I wanted had a good bite as well. My wife loved the Arizona eggs benedict. It had tomatillo sauce instead of the usual hollandaise sauce. There was also a hint of corn tortilla taste on the sauce that gave the dish a mexican finish. Eggs were poached perfectly and the runny yolk complimented the sauce. The sausage wasn't bad as well. Not too salty and but had enough kick at the end to tell you that you are eating a sausage. \n\nCoffee and pastry were also very good. Add the warm ambience and service with good, Benedict's Cafe just felt like home.\n\nmore reviews at \nhttp://themealexperience.blogspot.com/"
0,"We went here last night to get a late night snack. \n\nI ordered the shrimp balls. I didn't care for them. They were like a shrimp sausage meatball. I was hoping for more like whole shrimp. They were probably made the traditional way, so they may be good to people who are expecting that. But I didn't care for the texture nor the flavor. The dipping sauce was pretty good though.\n\nMy wife ordered the red bean shaved ice. It was okay. The flavor was decent and reminded me of red beans and rice. I'm not a fan of tapioca pearls though. I don't like the consistency. Again, it was probably made traditionally and may be enjoyable if that's what you liker expecting. But it's just not my thing. I'm kind of weird about consistency.\n\nWhile I'm not giving a great rating, it's based more on my personal preferences. I wouldn't dissuade people from going there if they like boba drinks. Just not my thing."
1,"Pullman's is a decent tapas place but I've definitely had better. It was very dark in the front where we sat and we both had trouble seeing our food well. Right above us was a pretty cool chandelier with hanging wine glasses, I noticed they were all clear glass except one black one.\n\nWe got the croquettes, mini bison burgers, smoked salmon and cheesecake. The croquettes were nice and crunchy on the outside and very smooth and creamy on the inside. The mini bison burgers were very tasted but came with way too many \""fries\"" which reminded me of some thin crispy things that came in a can that I used to eat as a kid. If they used half as many they would have gotten the same effect but they were too salty to eat all of them.\n\nWe also got a couple of Manhattan's that were well mixed but decided to move on to a different place for our next drink. The waitress and waiter were both very nice and good service is definitely a plus. The whole experience was pretty expensive and although the quality at Pullman's is good, I've had better for less cost."
1,"I thought the food was exactly what I needed that day.  Good comfort food and very filling.  They had a lot of menu options but I went with the Country Style Chicken Fried Chicken w/ mashed potatoes and macaroni & cheese.  It was really good and the portion was huge so I had lunch the next day.\n\nThe service was pretty good, waitress was very nice, attentive and didn't do anything wrong.  She did fail to remove dishes like appetizer plates and old glasses when she brought refills but that's being sort of picky."
1,"Dr. Finch is the best! I have 7 pets and I bring them to Baseline Animal Clinic because they care and it shows, reasonable prices, never have to wait (no overbooking), and can actually talk to the doc when have a question. My dog Katja has a hematoma (blood blister) on the tip of her ear. Dr. Finch took the time to explain everything to me so my anxiety was calmed and I knew my dog would be okay. Allergies are bad this season and dogs are feeling them too hence higher incidences of hematomas. Dr. Finch doesn't rush you in and out, spends time with you and you can see how much he genuinely cares about animals and us, the pet parents. I recommend him and his team -- you won't be sorry."
1,"This place blew our expectations out of the water! On our trip to ikea tonight, my husband and I were planning to go to Genghis grill since it was nearby but they were closed. I found YC'S on yelp and it had good reviews. My husband was leary when we first walked in because there was no one at the counter. The super nice waitress/hostess was helping a couple of first timers (like us) with their selections. She was very nice and showed us the ropes and even mixed the sauce up for me. The portions were HUGE! My husband who usually can eat his full meal had to throw in the towel halfway because it was too much food. We both have hearty lunch portions to take to work tomorrow. The soup bar was excellent especially the wontons. For only $23 they provide you such a great 3 course meal. They even had swirl cones for dessert. The hostess made sure we enjoyed our meal the whole time and even let us have free to go boxes since it was our first time. She even threw in a small box so I could take wonton chips. The customer service was excellent and the food was fantastic. I definitely recommend this location!!!!"
0,"I have  been going here for about a year and have had only a few bad experiences, such as rolled tacos being ice cold in the middle, too much cheeses put on all the dishes, and bad service.\n\nThe last time I went I got the fish tacos and was sick for the next 2 days. I went online to look up their health inspection and discovered they have failed the last 2 inspections for things not being at the correct temperature and some other major violations, needless to say I will not be back until this is corrected.\n\nAnd for the BIG guy that works the front counter & the drive through...smile..just a little..please. You made me feel so uncomfortable when I ordered my food..I was smiling and asking how your day was and you looked right in my face and did not respond!!"
1,"Stopped here the day before my birthday to get my coworkers a treat. The doughnuts were fresh, the service was fast, and the prices were ok. Not cheap, but definitely ok. Where this place shines is in the creativity. The only one I remember in particular was the Fat Elvis, and that alone will keep me coming back for more. All of my coworkers were desperate to know where I got the doughnuts. If you're on this side of town, it's a must try.\n\nEdit: Now open 24 hours."
1,"Too bad they decided to lower their prices. I think that may have put them out of business. We would have kept coming back at a higher price point and the naysayers and complainers looking for cheap meal would have stayed out.\n\n       \""  .  .  .  of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.\""\n                         Dennis Miller"
0,"I ordered my takeout at 530. I was told 20 min. I got there at 545 and waited and waited. At 555 I got up and asked for some water. At 605 I was told there was 2 orders in front of me. At 615 my order was finally ready. When I tried to voice my frustration, the girl ringing me up made excuses, the mngr didn't listen and literally laughed and waved to me goodbye as I was exiting the business. \n\nI used to support this place when they had little to no customers when they were first starting out. I was outraged at their handling of this. I will never return. And your food is decent but definitely over priced.  Customer service is NON EXISTENT as I've heard many others saying as well."
1,"After sobbing over the recently closed Ciao Ciao's, I was in need of another good pizza place. My friends suggested Grimaldi's, saying it might even beat my former pizza love, so I was game. \n\nI wouldn't go as far as saying it beat Ciao Ciao's, but it was definitely good and we will be back. \n\nWe took our 15 mo. old with us for an early Sunday dinner. It was great to see so many other kids there and they even offer \""kid dough\""-- pizza dough for the them to play with at the table. We got a large pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni... the pizza was great. Awesome crust, delicious sauce and cheese... the only thing I will not be getting again was the pepperoni. It was the small slices like you'd find on a Red Barron frozen pizza and the flavor wasn't great. We picked it off and still managed to finish the whole pizza. \n\nWe will definitely be returning. Great family place. Quick service. Yummy food. You can't beat it! (Although, I will say... I still miss Ciao Ciao's.)"
0,"*cue old man voice* Back in my day (late '90s), this place used to be something, something good. Value and quality has certainly dropped since I began going to Mr Lucky's in '96 when the steak and shrimp special was $5.95 and you weren't required to purchase a beverage and included a salad. The lemonade back in those days used fresh squeezed lemons not the powdered/concentrated crap they use now.\n\nThese days, you can still find the off the menu steak and shrimp special (show your players card to get the deal), but for $7.77 minus the salad (really? how much money did you save by taking off the salad?!) and you are required to purchase a drink ($3 for a soda/tea/lemonade) so in reality, your special is not so special at $10.77. The steak, I believe has also shrunk in size since the special began. The two things that remain awesome is the grilled shrimp and the garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nService, even sitting at the counter is spotty at best. \n\nIf you happened to look at the menu for other food, it includes overpriced breakfasts and other items. \n\nI guess if you are starving at 3-4 am, drunk, and don't want to stumble anywhere else outside of the casino, this will fit the bill, but I won't be rushing back here anytime soon. Instead, I will head over to Eillis Island for the steak, potato and beer special (which includes a salad!)"
1,"If I'd have to describe Pattie's in one word, it would be \""confused\"". But that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's like a big of mixture of things up in here. The crowd is very mix. Young and old, different ethnic backgrounds, nerds, cholos, douchebags and so forth... every walk of nature can be found here. The decor is just as confusing. It reminds me of the jungle book, but with some christmas lights, and a football jersey here and some party hats there, pasters everywhere, chains across the walls, oh and dollar bills galore on the ceilings.... it's like a hot mess. But I love it.  \n\nDrinks are inexpensive. We usually walk over here after dinner nearby to end our night. It's a good place to chill out and people watch while sippin' on a few drinks.\n\nOhhh & Big ups to the old man (the owner, I believe) rockin' it in the dj booth. He puts out some awesome jams. Now that's the business!"
0,I paid $13 for a less than six inch sandwich with a bit of cold lobster clumps and two tiny slices of avocado in the middle. The whole thing was super greasy and the lobster mixture tasted very creamy. Not worth the money. I'm very disappointed at this item and this truck.
1,"So normally I don't go for Filly-B's if I'm sober, but it looked so damn appealing on our way to Vegas last week. Compared to BK, McD's, and the Yum! Brand chains, Filiberto's was the lesser of those evils.\n\nIt was relatively clean, cheap as always, and pretty tasty for road food. We were going to eat at Taco Bell (best choice in Wickenburg for vegetarian), but I'm glad we crossed the parking lot to Filiberto's. I prefer real sour cream versus the stuff shot out from a gun. Pico de gallo! And the tortillas are so much better than those plasticky discs. Decent red and green salsa.\n\nWe'll stop here again on our next Vegas trip."
1,"I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was that I missed both the Elite event and the Sunday Brunch Club here. I'm a massive fan of brunch and I'm always on the lookout for somewhere new to try to see if they beat Toast in Marchmont (current reigning champion for the best brunch in Edinburgh.) \n\nThankfully I've now been to the Blue Bear a few times and it really is a fantastic restaurant for brunch. The food is phenomenal and generously portioned. The first time I went for brunch and had the 'Big Bear', their equivalent of a full breakfast, I couldn't finish it all. This was problematic for me as the food tasted so good that I didn't want to stop eating despite starting to make myself feel sick from being overfull. The Big Bear also comes with tea/coffee AND juice which is generous but way too much for me which leads to feelings of guilt that I can't finish my juice. \n\nI've also had the waffles here which are also a popular choice. It's disappointing that they don't have pancakes on the menu (or not that I've seen) as I'm much more partial to a pancake than a waffle. They are however very flexible in changing things on the menu. The last time I came here for food I had brought my eight year old (and very fussy eater) niece with me. She wanted waffles, but not a full portion, maple syrup and bananas please. Our waiter was kind enough to charge us a half portion of waffles and sort out the bananas for us. (They weren't on the menu at all.) Having a server who understands the pickiness of kids is amazing and makes a trip out with a little 'un less anxiety inducing as you worry what you can get them to eat. \n\nThe staff here are amazingly friendly and welcoming which makes coming back a real pleasure. I'm not sure it's nicked the top spot of Best Brunch in Edinburgh yet but it's certainly working on it and that means I'm definitely going to have keep going back until I can make up my mind."
1,Great place to work out and relax. After a couple of visits the staff knew my name. The place is clean and the staff is friendly.
1,Had the country fried steak again.  Of course it was good.  Meat was tender and flavorful.  The only thing I didn't like the the coffee....It tasted really burnt.  I guess they're really going to that diner taste!
0,"I used to live on rue bourget and the four years that i did and apparently many before this location sat empty. \nI drink a fair amount of espresso based coffee, the first coffee I ever drank was an espresso, so you can imagine I was excited at the prospect of being able to get one at the corner of my street.\nA group of us went in the day that they opened all supportive and 'welcome to the neighbourhood' like, all four us were shocked at the incredible attitude served with the coffee. \nTwice more did I have same style service. Never again.\nI am tired of feeling like I need to get down on my knees to pay hommage to whatever arrogant barista is giving the machine and themselves a handjob.\nThird wave please come crashing ashore and then roll back into the depths from whence you came, never to surface again."
0,"Bad service\nPubic hair and make up on \""clean\"" towel\nDirty room\n3 out of 3 restaurants on property\nDelivered sub-standard food quality and service.\nInsect in bed (see photo)\nWill never return.\nEnough said."
0,"You know, I used to really like this place.  My previous review was 4 stars.  They had a couple of good subs, but that quality has hit the fan in the past year.  \nI've made two to-go orders recently and they were BOTH messed up.  Each time, I ordered a salad w my sub and didn't receive it.  The first time, I was reallllly craving a salad and they forgot it - it was late and I was hungry, so I actually went back to Santisi's to get my food - a 40 minute round-trip from my neck of the woods.  This second time, hungry and fed up, I was not willing to drive back to Santisi's to have them fix their mistake.  So, I called to speak to a manager.  \nJohnny, the manager, told me that he would issue a gift certificate.  I explained that this was the last time I'm going there: it's a far drive and this is the second time they've messed up a simple order.  The subs aren't even what they used to be.  (Unless you LIKE soggy bread under your meatballs, of course.)  I just wanted the cost of my sandwich refunded (the salad comes w the sandwich) to the card I used.  Either ignoring my point or just not caring, he told me that I would have to drive to Santisi's to get a refund, because they needed to swipe my card and could not take the numbers over the phone.  Baloney, anyone?  Johnny just kept repeating policy until I got more and more frustrated with the fact that, again, it's MY responsibility to incur gas costs and take ANOTHER 40 minute drive so they could fix a mistake THEY made -- for a SECOND TIME!!  Finally, Johnny put me on hold while I was mid-sentence.  Really?!?!  I am apalled - and piiiiiissed!\nI thought this situation was deplorable and maybe an owner would care to hear about their dysfunctional kitchen and worse management.  WRONG!  I called to ask for the GM name, was not given a name, and put on hold for over four minutes.  Finally, Toni Santisi and I speak and not only does she deny Johnny put me on hold mid-sentence (the customer is always right, right?!) but she barely lets me get out a complete sentence and talks over me the whole time to end by insulting me.  She said she cannnot issue a partial refund, but she can void the entire transaction in order to have my husband and I never set foot in her dirty bar again.  I'm sure she won't issue a refund because - surprise! - they never took our name when we ordered on the phone.  Way to run your business.  Besides, that was decided when I came home and you screwed my order up for the SECOND TIME IN A ROW.\nNow, don't get me wrong, I will go out of my way for exceptional food (I'm talking to you, Capriotti's sub shop on Mill), but I will NOT go out of my way to have so-so food from a place run by monkeys."
1,"This salon is probably the best nail salon in Scottsdale. The owner, Lee, is such a sweet lady. Her staff are very friendly and talented. Most importantly, THEY DO NOT UP SELL. Additionally, this salon is very nice, clean, and serene. Prices are fair and competitive with other local salons."
1,We saw this place on Groupon and decided to try it out. We really enjoyed this place. \nFor a conveyor belt sushi joint their selections were pretty good.  The service could be slow during rush hour. I save my receipt for 15% off next visit.
0,overpriced with NOTHING to show for it. Hall carpets\nworn and stained...cheap plastic lights hung hung in \ndisarray.. Room: pubic hair in tub and bath floor..coffee stains on counters...towels as rough as sand paper..bed stunk like an old man.  should be called the Motel 5 because it does not even compare to Motel 6....NEVER AGAIN!!!
1,"I was eating solo this night and was starving when I was perusing the Caesars mall. I decided to go for a known quantity since I have known CF for years. I ate at the bar and had my usual soda and small chopped salad and bread. It came out to $15 bucks with tip. That's CHEAP by Vegas standards. The small salads are a good deal b/c CF gives you a huge amount of food in the main entrees and so these are just the right generous portion and most hotel rooms have no place to refrigerate or heat up your doggy bag anyways.\n\nBar staff was great. I think it was Tim that helped me. Always made sure to keep my glass filled. Kudos to him and he's cute to boot.\n\nVerdict: Okay so CF is a chain that is everywhere nowadays, but it's nice to find someplace that is a known quantity, fed me in less than an hour, and isn't charging 50% more than their normal outlets and has a nice bar staff."
0,"Went here on a Tuesday night last week. Service was horrible. We barely saw our waitress and never got a refill on my glass of water so I was thirsty the whole time. I ordered a pasta, which was pretty good but not amazing. Also, the portion size was tiny so with both the taste and size, not work 15 bucks. Also they forgot my salad so they brought it to me after I already ate my pasta."
1,this place-great service! I found this place about a year ago & moved so I stopped going but today I ventured back here on a random whim. It felt so good to go back! Hispanic Jackie did my pedicure & nails & she was such a sweetheart with amazing technique & serious massage skills! Tiny but strong hands! The owner & her daughters want customers to have first class service so no one is rushed thru & it's a real chill vibe! You notice right away the customers are all loyal long standing customers & the girls make everyone feel part of the family! I also noticed they are honest about wait times! They dont lie & say 10 min like most nail shops because they aren't pushing people thru like cattle! Extremely clean & all supplies are new & sterilized! It's best to make an appointment ahead of time! I was lucky to get in as a walk in! Asian Jackie creates art with her nail brush & it was fun watching her in action & hears the oooh & awwws!
1,"This little gem in downtown phoenix is easy to overlook. Located in what appears to be another house in a residential area but is actually a quiet Italian restaurant. The place is nestled behind a row of trees that afford some privacy for the patio diners. \nThe menu is mostly comprised of pizzas but it offers a wide selection of both red and white sauce varieties.  There is also a decent selection of salads to accompany your meal.  Tonight I shared a salad with goat cheese strawberries and cartelized walnuts. Very delicious combination.  For dinner I had a red sauce pizza with artichokes, prosciutto and olives(whole). Quite a scrumptious flavor explosion. I didn't sample the desert menu which is made up of crepes of various flavors, although most of them entail Nutella. \nThe servers were extreme knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent service.  Although I have to admit that the service was a little slow at the end. Overall this was a great place to spend a dinner with friends and celebrate a birthday."
0,I will NEVER go to this hotel ever again. I was promised a room with a view of the strip but when we arrived they said that it was changed to a pool but when we went to the room there was no view but a stupid wall and a piece of the sky. The service was bad they left the food in the hallway for more than 2 nights it was horrible. Seriously the spa suite that  smelled like a garbage dump. \n\nNext time go to Monte Carlo were they have better rooms and service for the price.
0,Just popped into Bicycle Haus this past week looking for new components for my ride. I was looking at a custom order  (~$1500 worth). Guy behind the counter was busily typing away and thanked me and said he'd call me. I walked around the corner and glanced over my shoulder. Turns out the guy was on Facebook the whole time....very disappointing.
1,"I was having a bad hair day and wanted to get a blow out. Even though Drybar was a miss for me the first time, I decided to give it another chance (well after their grand opening). I was immediately greeted and asked if I wanted a beverage. My appointment began right on time. Brittany was my stylist and she was EXCELLENT! She clearly knew what she was doing- I appreciated that she told me every product that was going in my hair (permission granted first) and what the product would do. I also got the floater, which was a divine 10 minute scalp massage during my wash. It's $10 extra but so worth it! My appointment lasted an hour as I got my hair curled with a curling iron after it was blown out. She was a good salesperson because I also purchased the gold mine product, which helps with fly away's and serves as a leave in conditioner. She even showed me how the product works in her own hair...pretty cool! I connected well with Brittany and will ask for her again when I come back! Thanks Ali for reaching out to me after my first experience, customer service here is superb! I would recommend for a great experience and great hair!"
1,"this is our everyday breakfast spot while we were in vegas. just a few steps from our hotel, 24 hours, good price, fast service.\n\ni love, looooved the skillets. a perfect mix of carbs and veggies. always packed, always delicious, 4 stars!"

0,"As soon as I got home and tried my take out, one word came to mind...BLAND.\nI got two dishes that I always get at other places...General Tso's  Chicken and Beef Pepper Steak. The General Chicken had no heat and was almost flavorless, the chicken was pretty dry too. The beef in the Beef Pepper Steak  was tender but this sauce had no flavor either. \nI decided to try a new place because of all the great reviews and I was passing through this area, I am so disappointed.\nThe customer service was the highlight of the place. But that won't bring me back."
0,"My Flight from Phoenix to Vegas was delayed by over an hour. A few days later and our return flight was delayed also... WTF? I've flown SWA extensively for work but they are making me reconsider. What happened to the best on-time performance.\n\nAlso on the flight here no drink service on the flight due to turbulence. There were a few bumps but c'mon it was a flight to Vegas.!!! I have experienced much worse and still got a coke or beer. Also the flight attendants had ZERO personality. That makes up for a lot (cattle car boarding, packing us in like sardines, dealing with airport security, etc)\n\nYou have work to do SWA..."
1,Went here with my friends after a DRUNK at Tao nightclub. I have to say for Pho made at 330am it was fantastic! The fresh rolls were also quite delicious. Now all this might have been because I was plastered but the hot broth sobered me up and tasted great....basically 3am + Pho = can't complain :)
0,"This place may have new management. Service is slow, they are out of forks! Og and several of the sodas are out. Mention it to them and are told they will get right on that, still waiting. I used to love the roast beef bit I guess it lost out to one of the newer chickens. We don't all want to eat healthy, a good rare roast beef now amd then would be nice. Not sure I will come back...paneri here I come."
0,"Vegetarians beware... I don't eat red meat, and ordered a cup of something the person working called \""vegetarian chili\"" on the phone. I referred to it by the same name when I stopped in a few minutes later and ordered it to go, with no correction. Walked back to my office to find a bowl full of mostly meat (with a few carrots/peppers thrown in). Super misleading, and disappointing. I am giving it one star because I did eat in the restaurant once and had a good sandwich. Just don't get anything to go. This is very close to work, and I was excited to find something with healthier options, but not sure if I'll be back."
1,"Great Local Casino and Hotel!  Great service!  Appreciative staff!\n\nI think this place is a great location for a local casino AND hotel.  First off they have friendly staff though of course I can't say EVERY person.  Some hosts are better than others but the front desk staff combined with another host AND the casino floor staff made our experience fun and enjoyable.  Stayed here one full day and night, before moving to a Ceasar's location for a special event and closer to main portion of the strip.  But we stayed on a Friday night and it was a very fine, full experience.  Bell/Valet staff attentive, friendly, always willing to give suggestions or recommended services.\n\nChecked in early; they had one of our rooms ready but not the second.  That was fine as we were able to leave luggage in one room and commence having fun gambling and having a few adult beverages.  Our reservation made by phone at one rate but we had mailers that reduced that cost.  They just told us to bring in the mailers and they would adjust the rate to what they said.  Front desk happily obliged and reduced the cost of the room.  And it's NOT like they are that expensive in the first place.  The only issue can be is they only have 4 floors of rooms or so, so they fill up quickly.\n\nThey have a wide range of restaurants and despite other's opinions on the subject online we found that the food and service was excellent (for the most part) all the way around.  Had dinner at the Twin Creeks Steakhouse.  Thought food was impeccable (I had a steak; my friend had sea food/ahi special and he thought it was fantastic) and the service was top notch.  We ate breakfast on Saturday at the Sundance Grill and the service was both friendly, quick and the meal was bountiful for breakfast.  Had fresh fruit plate and breakfast entrees.  The only meal that I would say was a little mediocre was at the Seasons' Buffet.  And it was for a rather different reason.  Seating (as having a players card) was prompt and the food tasted fantastic.  BUT what we both thought was a little different is while there is a quite bountiful selection of items of diverse cuisines, it didn't seem like they were \""complete\"".  In other words it was like they did SOME Mexican food or SOME italian food but never quite completed the full theme.  And due to their building a time share tower soon on the other end of the  property, the buffet was LOADED with folks getting their free meal to go with the presentation.  Probably ONLY complaint about the property.......LOL  Too many time share guests during the day.......Also a Starbucks, Johnny Rockets (for diner/hamburger meals) and lots of bars (from main bar close to pit areas) to Mermaid Bar at front, close to Aquarium.\n\nPool is small, but adequate.  They have a convention center or entertainment center outside that will handle small concerts and events.  And as a local establishment, they have many.  Gaming is adequate and most of the pit crew were friendly.  Lots of Asian dealers......not saying anything bad whatsoever, just giving you a clue as to environment.  Also later at night on weekends, they have a party pit with friendly, mainly attractive women.  And what is DIFFERENT and good about THEIR party pit is they have the SAME rules as their regular casino..........none of that 6-5 Blackjack BS!!!!  That makes a difference folks!!  Rest of casino has the usual variety of games from the carnival table games like Ultimate Texas Hold'em to Mississippi Stud, to regular Blackjack (shoes and hand held games......single deck has limited rules and only one table but at least it's NOT 6-5 like a lot of the greedier joints around town.\n\nAnd also, can't miss Bass Pro Shop next door.  It ALSO has it's own aquarium and animal displays.  \n\nLet me give one example of why I think this is a particularly good place as to service.  When we checked out, we had charged most of our food to the room.  Well I had a $10 credit toward food slip from the players club that I misunderstood how to use.  I thought I just needed to give it at check out and it would be deducted.  I was supposed to use it at the actual restaurant instead.  But the front desk staff (at check out) offered to credit me there, rather than go back to restaurant to change bill, though that was the proper procedure.  BUT actually, the story gets better as to friendliness.  We were semi-players (partial comped) and we played quite a bit the night before.  But we knew we were only there one day and we already knew we had the room comps or discounts given already.  Well the initial casino host that we booked with was not available at check out but the front desk clerk offered to have our bills reviewed when the next host on shift came on.  She said she would call us with any adjustments and email or send our final bills after they were made (if any).  That was great with us and we checked out and went on to our next place............well, LO AND BEHOLD, we gambled enough--all comped!!"
0,"Yuck. All around. Dirty, nasty, and tacky! We had wings there which literally glowed under the \""awesome\"" black lights. We call them Snot Wings. There are plenty o'dive bars out there which are good and good for ya. This is not one of them."
0,"Place is pretty big with no vendors.  Alot of spaces are open and the building has horrible smell filling the air, almost like a combo of body odor and century old clothes.  I was here to get info on vendor/renting space but there is absolutely no shoppers and experience was awful.  I am get the idea that building owners/management of the swap meet must be pretty bad with all the spaces open and no renters.  \nMy personal first time experience...while walking up to the office to get info  I witnessed something that no shopper or person should have to go through.  So There was middle eastern lady that was working or managing in the office yelling horrible things at a shopper who lost a child about how horrible a person she was and that she was not going to take her child until the police arrived. Whoa! Little kid was ok and mother was in tears!  I totally felt bad for the mother because we all have had that horrible experience of losing a kid in non familiar place and just want to comfort your child.  I was almost about to say something but totally shocked when security with turbans  started harassing the whole family all the way out of the building.  PRETTY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND WILL NOT GO BACK TO SHOP OR SELL WHATSOEVER!  i am sure that poor family won't be returning either and must I say DON'T LOOSE YOUR CHILD THERE. GEESH!"
0,1 star for the fries that keep me coming back like a bad itch. Plus one more for the 24 hour bit - for the pure entertainment watching people passed out over their booth. Awesome.
1,"I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations available. Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's $2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft. \n\nThe price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too.\n\nThe service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here."
1,"I love sushi! I am always on the look out for great AYCE. About a year ago my friend took me here and now I am hooked! I have yet to find anything better. I WILL ONLY GO TO GOYEMON!! Fresh, unique, satisfying, great daily specials, and just yummmmyyyy! \n\nThey have good customer service for what it is. They are always busy except during early lunch hours from my experiences. People are ordering crazy amounts of food. Most of the servers are on it!  I also love that you can take your time. There have been times when a group of friends and I have been there for almost 3 hours! \n\nThere are so many delicious items available for AYCE it's ridiculous but awesome. My favorite roll is the hurricane. Always check their daily specials board. Amazing grilled squid, cajun salmon, and unique fresh fishes. The garlic edamame is the way to go. Buttery, garlicky, little morsels of deliciousness! The shumai (fried) rock my socks off. I could go on and on about the deliciousness that is Goyemon! This is the place to go for stellar sushi! and AYCE!"
1,Surprisingly good food.
1,"This is my new spot for Gyros!\n\nIf you are gonna check it get it with Feta, makes such a huge difference. then again Feta on anything makes it better, kinda like bacon I guess. \n\nPrice is decent, portion is nice sized, tomatoes on gyro tatse crisp and fresh. \n\nThe mall location kinda sucks since I'm not much of a mall rat. \n\nThey have the meat on the spit which is awesome and the only way they should really be doing gyros."
0,"I'm not saying its bad, but for $100/person, I'd rather eat 20 double doubles, 2 Jim Brady cuts at Lawry's, line up at the Wynn buffet 3 times and then gorge on frozen custard at Luv-It with the money I have left over!  \n\nThe service was ok, our waiter was nice but never refilled our drinks.  Even when you'd ask, he'd always forget.  (then again he was 95yrs old, yes 95. Homeboy looked liked a corpse from the Bodies Exibit at Tropicana)\n\nWARNING:  They raised their prices and haven't disclosed it yet, so don't fall out of your chair like we did when the bill arrived."
1,"Been here a few times. The service isn't the best (usually only 1 or 2 employees constantly on the phone or running around), but we've always taken it to go. It's usually about 25-40 mins depending on how busy they are.\n\nWe've had the chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, masala dosa, garlic naan, and others. The naan can be hit or miss; tonight it was rather dry and crispy. The various sauces that come with the dosa are about average.\n\nI've never had an issue with missing items in my to go order, but I was double check the bag for any take-out order.\n\nI'll continue to go back, as they provide great value for the food/price points. If you don't want to drive to Scottsdale or up to Pinnacle Peak and pay 2x as much, then I recommend this place!"
1,"Awesome food best indian food in Vegas I m coming from last 15 years.. Same taste & good service very friendly. I will recommend Gandhi for indian food..,"
1,"Classic, just like you remember.,,,,\n\nPerhaps, like me, you remember trips to the A&W as a kid on a hot summer day to get that enormous, frosty mug of sweet, cold root beer as a special treat.  I remember agonzing over the decision, ice cream cone or frosty mug of beer (parents wouldn't let us have both). \n\nI hadn't stopped into an A&W in a long, long, time and was looking for something a little less fast-foody on my drive south when I decided to stop at this A&W.  I've driven by it on the interstate a hundred times on my way back and forth from Minneapolis to Madison but had never before stopped in.\n\nI got a burger and fries, which were fine, but the real treat was a real frosty mug (eat in only) that I could fill myself at the beverage counter with straight from the barrel A&W root beer.  Now that was a really something special."
0,"I would have given them \""0\"" star but that's NOT an option.\n\nMy girlfriends and I came here for a little Cali getaway and we were sooo excited to finally stay at this upscale establishment.  We finally checked in and upon arrival to our room we were very disappointed with the interior of the room.  Here's to name a few:\nbroken lamp, leftover hair tie from previous customer, leaky toilet, 2 soiled towels with holes all over, no \""please do not disturb\"" plaque for the door, and poor lighting (dead light bulbs) \nSo, we went downstairs to talk to \""Kevin\"" at the front desk. We were NOT received with a warm welcome at all.  He didn't even greet us with a \""hello, how may I help you?\"" He seemed preoccupied & that we were \""taking up his precious time\"" kinda attitude.  So, I presented him with the list of things that was wrong with the room.  I shared with him that I don't want to be charged for the broken lamp so please notate my account.  He apologized and simply offered us a credit of $100 to be used anywhere in the hotel.  $100 at the Cosmo doesn't get you anywhere since alcoholic drinks are $15-$20 and coffee is $7-$9.  So I requested to be moved to another room, in which he denied my request.  I didn't want to press any further since we were there to celebrate.    \n\nAt 3:30am.....we were woken up by the sound of loud drilling noises from the level above us.  I called down and spoke with a front-desk manager and he graciously comped us for our 2nd night. However, the drilling didn't stop until 4:30am.  We couldn't believe one of the newest multi-million dollar establishment would be drilling in the middle of the night during a \""on season\"" time. SMH...or did they give us a \""cheap, leftover room\"" in which lots of hotels do since I'm a Marriott Gold Member customer where I get my room discounted for being a loyal client of their chain.  You think it would be the reverse however, in this situation it wasn't. The next day, upon our departure we were woken by 3 different people before 9am. The reason for the constant barrage of people is because we never got our \""do not disturb\"" plaque.  So \""Kevin\"" never followed up on my original complaints. Worst of all, we were then given 2 more soiled towels with holes in them as well!!! Then, at 9:58am the head maid came to confront us about the uncleanliness compliant that we made. So, this was the straw that broke the camel's back. We went to the front desk to voice our concerns.  We requested for a manager and we were brushed off as they claimed that she's in a meeting and we were urged to email her, here her business card.  What??!!!! A multi-million dollar hotel's manager refused to come out to remedy a customer's concerns. So, lesson learned from the previous day we refused to leave until she came out. Then, I brought up the situation about the maid coming to our room to confront us, that's when the manager decided to come out of her hiding.  With her British accent (Elaine),  she apologized for our inconveniences and agreed to comp one extra day.  The whole experience left such a horrific feeling that we were unable to enjoy our stay.  They completely ruined our whole vacation since we spent a good 3 hrs trying to remedy the problem.  Beware....the Cosmo might look appealing on the exterior but the interior is so worn down, unkept rooms, filthy towels, mismanaged, unprofessional, unethical, and just down right \""SHADY\""."
1,"Love firehouse Subs! Been going there since there grand opening! Went yesterday to get my Free Birthday sub! Had the new Sweet Thai chili pork Sub, a new favorite of mine. Jenifer made my sub with sauce on the side, for the reason in the past when I had it to go and got home the sauce was all on the outside and made bread soggy. Thanks Jenifer for a perfect meal on the go! And your sweet smile and great attitude while working!!! :-)"
1,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Best of Philly yet... I've been coming here for ten years now and the food is always consistent, tasty and cheap.  Yes, the cheesesteaks are delicious, but you HAVE to try their gyros. AMAZING. Just remember your number if you call in for takeout...they don't take your name. Bombsteak!"
1,"Great staff, live music every night, not stuck up or stuffy, not as expensive as some pubs on the Royal Mile. You could do a LOT worse in Edinburgh. Especially if the wankiness of George Street just isn't your thing..."
1,"Was time to make the transition from a full to a King, and I couldn't be more pleased with the service I received here! David was wonderful and guided me to the right bed to fit my needs. I never felt pressured and he was more than happy to answer any of my questions. And most of the beds are made right here in the valley, so you're supporting local business too! I'm sleeping like an angel, and you will too if you go to R&S Mattress!"
1,Best burgers in town hands down. Presentation is an art form here. There service makes you feel at home. I love stopping by when I'm on this side of town. Very excellent experience all the way around every time.
0,"I've gotta agree with the poor reviews.  My wife and I went on a Saturday around lunch.  \n\nTwo years ago we were in Manhattan for their San Gennaro festival.  I didn't go in expecting this to compare but I was surprised at the stark contrast.\n\nI was expensive!  Even with the coupon it was $12 to get in.  $9 for a poor sausage and pepper sandwich (we didn't finish it). $10 for two beers.  The way I look at it I paid $31 to get dusty and realize I was in the wrong place.  Shoulda spent it on boxing a trifecta!\n\nThe one diamond was the old sweet Italian man that was wandering around the food court singing.  He didn't sing to us but we chatted with him for a minute.  Boy he had the sweetest smile.  Reminded me of my Pop pop.\n\nI'm would never go on a carnie ride, I guess I am just chicken, so I came here for the Italian experience and food.  I always feel badly for the animals too.\n\nThere is zero \""Italian experience\"" to be had and unfortunately it looks like we just picked a bad vendor.  I saw some people carrying around some great looking food.  Then again, our sausage and peppers LOOKED great.\n\nThe singer when I was there was laughably bad.  Khaki docker pants, white sneakers, black shirt, and a voice that fit only a mother could love.  Looked like a Seinfeld outfit from the 90's.  Sounds like some other people got to enjoy some better acts.  He wasn't one of the \""headliners\"".\n\nA big part of the turn off was the dirt lot the event was held on.  I try to go to a lot of festivals, I really like browsing around, but this one just fell flat.  A different location might bring a tiny bit of much needed class to this event.\n\nGood thing that Turf Paradise is a short walk away.  Had fun there!"
0,I was just finished my review as we were eating but then. While we were eating our desert they already took our payment and as soon as that happened the service went down hill. No one was paying attention to us anymore we tried to order more because we we were not done eating yet but no one was really paying attention to us. It took them another 20 min just to bring out Green tea ice cream. Which in reality how long does it really take to get the green tea ice cream  unless they actually make it themselves. But the other deserts came out in less than a min. They are normally pretty good but this time I was a little embarrassed because we brought our friends telling them that it was a pretty good place. :(
0,"My boyfriend and I usually stay at the Cosmopolitan, but since we were meeting friends in Vegas who were staying at PH, we decided to stay there as well. I was hesitant, but the rates were much cheaper, so I thought \""why not?!?\""\n\nNow I'll tell you why that was a mistake:\n\nWe arrived a few hours before check-in, but we assumed we could check in early because we always do at the Cosmo. Right here I quickly learned that PH is nothing like the Cosmo. The man checking us in informed us that it would be an $18.60 charge and kept trying to convince us to stay in a room with a better view for $20 more a night. We decided to stay in the room we booked, which turned out to be a total dump! \n\nThe room itself was on a \""non-smoking floor.\"" I put that in quotes because the entire floor smelled like smoke for the 3 nights that we were there. Clearly no one enforced this \""rule.\"" By the time I left, I had a sore throat and a headache from all of the smoke.\n\nWhen we got into the room I thought \""this looks familiar!\"" The reason it looked familiar was because I had stayed in the same room 12 years ago when it was the Aladdin. Not much had changed in 12 years. The decor was not very \""Hollywood\"" at all. (I know Hollywood, I lived there for over 10 years...) The faucets even still have the genie lamps on them! The \""Miracle Mile\"" mall looks like the Middle East (again, the Aladdin decor has not changed there either.)\n\nOur friends had a huge suite with an amazing view, but unfortunately the view was the only high point. The room felt old as well; definitely not worth the price of a suite.\n\nThis hotel needs a major upgrade and remodel. Hopefully Britney's upcoming shows will bring in enough cash to allow them to do so. The one thing I learned from our trip: just spend the extra money and stay at the Cosmo. It's clean and modern and the staff treats you like royalty.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the $20 per night resort fee! It's ridiculous that we had to pay that since we weren't using the gym or the internet. The final price with the extra fees would have allowed us to stay somewhere much more upscale. Wish I had known that. Total disappointment!\n\nOne final note: we had to cut and design our own \""Do not disturb\"" sign because they didn't give us one. Is paper that expensive these days? I should not have to do graphic design work while on vacation, especially when I'm not getting paid for it!!!"
1,"While Benecol is clinically proven to lower your cholesterol, this place is clinically proven to raise it. I guarantee you'll enjoy eating at this place, but make sure you've sent off to China for your donor heart before hand, cuz you'll be needing a new one.\n\nOn my one and only visit I got a deep fried pizza which I chewed on in the company of two JF's. They, being PHD students, probably viewed me with utter contempt, and were only there with me to conduct a study into socially inept and underdeveloped human beings. As a result I ate with a reasonable degree of dignity in an effort not to draw too much attention to myself.\nHad I been dining alone, my behaviour would have been distinctly less muted, and I would have wrung the doughy treat out into my mouth like a tea towel saturated with pizza flavoured fat. Then with more enthusiasm than a Romanian prostitute who had just realised she could earn a Leu and get something warm in her belly at the same time, I would have sucked the oily dregs from its limp remains, and given thanks for the privilege.\n\nYUM-YUM."
0,"All those pictures of huge chunks of lobster had me dying to try this roll. Unfortunately after i paid my $23 for my sandwich, fries, and soda all i got was a tasty buttered bun with scraps of lobster that didnt even reach the top of the bun. I'm wondering if the fact that mine came in a togo box had anything to do with my quality. What was there tasted fine, but like i said, there was hardly anything in the bun and my last two bites were only bun. Stick with Todd English Pub's lobster rolls. They may seem small but there is 3 of them."
0,Expect no service pretty much at all. That includes the bar. We hunted for anyone to help us for a long time. One poor guy in our party is still waiting for his food long after we have all eaten. The staff is poor and don't really care. I only left a tiny tip and they didn't deserve that. JUST STAY AWAY! Listen to his music at home and have a beer from the fridge and save the hassle!
0,"We ate there last Saturday, before heading out to the comedy club. While it was an enjoyable dinner, I have to say I was just not impressed and will probably not return. The food looks great on their website, and the descriptions really are what made us decide to dine there. But the reality didn't meet our expectations. \n\nService was definitely A+. I have to say that much. Our server was great! He was on the ball, put up with all our crap (we had two smart-asses in the group), and kept our glasses full.\n\nOur  meals were blah all the way around...\n\nWe started with an appetizer of \""fire stix\"" - beef on a stick in a spicy sauce and fried wontons. The wontons were stale, the marinated and mequite grilled beef tasted bland and neither marinated nor mesquite grilled, and the hot sauce was more sweet than hot.\n\nThe Southwest Salad (with a Chicken breast on top) was nothing out of this world, though very tasty and I did enjoy it.\n\nOne of my companions ordered the Marguerita Pizza, of which I had a taste. It seemed like re-heated pizza. I'm not saying it was, but it TASTED that way. The crust was way chewy, and the toppings seemd to have been drying up on it for a while. My companion was not happy with it either.\n\nAnother dining companion ordered the Strawberry Spinach Salad (has apples, candied walnuts and goat cheese with a strawberry vinaigrette). She liked it, but wasn't impressed. \n\nOur fourth member had the Southwest Kobe Beef Burger and loved it. It looked great, but i can't really give a fair review on this one. He didn't give me much feedback to work with."
1,"Kinda surprised this place only has a 3.5 average rating. \n\nI really like Vida. I have been here several times over the last year and always had a good experience. The margaritas were outstanding and the portions were pretty sizable (I couldn't finish my meal!). And oh, the ceviche cocktail is heavenly (I included that in one of my tips). I get a fair amount of really good Mexican food in Chicago and Vida sizes up pretty well."
1,Ok I'm old. But this place is dark. So dark you can't read the menu. So I pull out my phone and use it as a light. We started off with the potstickers. They were a bit burnt so they started off on the wrong foot.  I ordered the filet salad. I enjoyed it. Couldn't see when I had eaten the good stuff so that was a negative. My husband had the green chile cheeseburger. He enjoyed it. We'll go back. During the day. They have windows so we'll be able to see!! We'd like to sit outside too. It looks nice to sit around the moat. ;-)
0,"Very disappointing meal.  We had the bone-in rib eye and the porterhouse steaks to share for the four of us.  Average meat.  The dry rub was very good and the meat was cooked exactly as we requested but the meat is not of the quality of the prices! The fries were not good (saves calories!) nor was the Mac n Cheese, though the truffle corn was very good.  Overall not at all on the level of other steak restaurants in Las Vegas."
1,"Love this place!  My little chi, Moe, has been going there for the past month or so and it's been wonderful.  I love that when I call to schedule him for day camp or boarding they immediately know which dog he is and express their excitement that he'll be coming.  Moe has some attachment issues and likes to be near people constantly and they're fine with that.  In fact, they even seem to love it rather than being annoyed by it.  I love that they do the initial temperament test to make sure he'll do well there and that they have webcams running 24/7 that I can view on my phone.  The fact that he can run free and play (or climb in a lap!) all day is great!  I also really like that he's with dogs of all sizes and not separated into groups based on size like so many other facilities.  The report cards that are sent promptly at the end of each day and the pics on Facebook are all extra perks offered at Villa La Paws that make the experience of trusting them with your dog even easier."
0,"I quoted blinds from multiple locations and Bugsy beat the price. I was excited a company with great reviews for the best price.  They have been out to my house over 4x now to \""fix\"" broken blinds.  They use some cheap shit plastic grommet between the wood shutters and the pivot point.  If you open and close the shutters more than a few times you end up with broken slats.  I'm not saying they aren't friendly when they come to fix them... They are.  They have a ridiculously long guarantee.  I don't know how they can afford to come out to the same place so many times to fix the same problem.  I wish I had paid a tiny bit more for better quality blinds.  What a waste of time."
1,"i live in l.a. and asked for a great rib rest. while visiting the vegas area and i was told of this new place in henderson  just opened so i tried it,there was 5 of us and we all loved the ribs and chicken the sides where delicious.  but best of all was the friendly people there i  will be going back on my next trip there, its as good as any rib place i've been too."
1,"Nice to hear a GOOD tale about a business...Month back I bought a fruitless Plum tree at Star Nursery...It croaked in just a few days...Went back and showed them pixs and whithout a hassle they said to come back and they would exchange it for a different tree that might do better in our back yard...Jim was the mgr. and today he brought out two trees from the back of their lot to show me...Above and beyond...That is why I shop at STAR Nursery...You should , too...If you hit the Ann Rd store, thank Jim once again for me...OK?"
1,"We came for an evening of Christmas merry making.  We started late in the afternoon with ice skating.  Unable to stand in skates without support from a parent, grandparent, or rail, my daughter had a blast.  Next, we toured the lights in the fading sun of the afternoon.  After that, we toured the light displays  in the moonlight.  Trees were wrapped, and there were various displays including a pirate ship, rocking horse, star fish, some wise men, etc.  The menorah was a nice touch.  After exercising our legs, we visited La Hacienda for dinner.  A great high end Mexican restaurant with a sommelier for the wine and a sommelier for the tequila.  After dinner we headed back to the car via the entrance and happened upon the giant Christmas tree with the lights dancing in step with Christmas music.  A great end to a great evening."
0,Ok first off came for buffet and the set up is retarded!! Who ever designed it should be shot. You have to wait in line to be called to pay then wait to be seated.... it was a two hour wait we finally gave up and left as the line was not moving so I drove all the way here to just wait in line and leave.... will never go back again not worth my time or gas no one was friendly the valet was rude... and amazing how they would have misters in the valet waiting area and you would think on a 110 degree day you would have them on but no we got to wait for our car in the blazing heat... real classless hotel not worth time or money
1,Ate lunch there yesterday and had a very good patty melt.  I will eat there again and it was really reasonable too!
0,This place is bull s#%\u00a3 I had an appointment at 12:00 and now it is 1:00 and I'm still waiting. We have asked them how much longer 3 times and they keep saying your next and now 7 people have gone back. Avoid this place if you can.
1,"Had a great night, a very, very  tasty filet and at a cost that's less than what I find at my favourite steak place in Chicago - what's not to like?"
1,I love this place! I try something new every time I go and I love everything! Service is great. Happy hour specials are great. Definitely recommend.
0,"I had to have the maid come in and change our sheets that had been changed earlier with sheets that were stained with who knows what.  But it was disgusting and I can't imagine the first maid that put the sheets on could have missed it.  \n\nOur neighbors had a nice screaming match that sounded like it could get violent at any moment.  I called security, they never showed.  \n\nThe hallways smell of old cat litter box. Nasty! \n\nThe front desk people are rude and don't even let you speak.  They just speak over you and tell you NO.\n\nThe whole place is old and needs some serious renovations.  Our room looked like they tried to remodel at some point but it was more of slapping some new stuff over the old stuff."
1,"We love the food here. The curry dishes are fantastic and we seem to always go back to them. We also find the food to be very consistent which is great if you find something you really like, you can expect the same flavor the next time around when you order the dish.\n\nService/staff is super friendly.\n\nHighly recommended!!"
0,"Twice in less than a month I have been affected by the irresponsibility of the employees at Fitness Connection. I've waited in the parking lot for someone to show and open the gym. There's nothing like waking up at 4:40am, getting dressed and driving to the gym to realize you've wasted your time and sat in the parking lot for 30 min. Who knows when this employee actually showed, because we all gave up. It's time to hire responsible employees that show to work on time. You threw off my Monday."
1,"This was a great experience all around. Brian showed up on time to give me the estimate, no muss no fuss. The day of the actual work, his guys were right on time and did an excellent job from start to finish. I have more work to get done and I have all the confidence in the world that I found my landscapers. Good job, guys!"
0,"Bland bland bland!!!! My family and I were there for Sunday lunch.  We all ordered  pasties and all of us were terribly disappointed.  The food was soooooooo bland and unseasoned. No flavor at all.  Service was bad too, the server didn't came to our table not even once. Worst place to eat in Scottsdale."
1,"We came here because we heard it had good wings. We felt like some pizza, so combined the two and ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. When we did get the pizza, I was disappointed. It wasn't horrible, but I've had better buffalo chicken pizza. For food, I would give the pizza 3 stars (I still want to go back for the wings though). They get an extra star from me for the customer  service. When we got our pizza, they brought out a BBQ chicken pizza. Usually we would shrug off the mistake and enjoy anyway, but we happened to be in the mood for something spicy. They not only apologized, but boxed the BBQ pizza and gave it to us for free while they remade the buffalo pizza. I was impressed."
0,"While the website and face value scream high-class and high quality, the over-all experience left a lot to be desired.\nThe valet parking somehow was 'full' when we tried to retire for the evening, even after we had checked in early in the afternoon.\nThere is no on-site parking. Either valet, or you are left to your own devices.\nThe rooms were half the size of an expected suite. You can still see evidence of the renovations and upgrade that they made, which was tacky. \nThe entire experience was over-prices. You would expect a better experience for the money you paid. \nBreakfast within the hotel was also over-priced.\n\nI doubt I ever return."
1,"This gym is great. \n1. There is wifi. Cardio is mind numbing! Unless you have some Netflix  happening; that changes everything!\n2. It's cheap! Especially if you are going to the same gym- not hopping all over town. And even then, still competitively priced. \n3. It's not crowded and there are a lot of machines. \n4. The locker rooms are clean, modern- actually beautiful. \n5. They have all of this positive stuff, on the walls- everywhere. Judgement free zone. I thought it was marketing, but this really seems to be the philosophy going on there and it is very motivating.\n6. THE STAFF. How nice are these guys? Really nice. Friendly. Maybe it's different for other locations, but at MY gym I'm so impressed at how friendly  and helpful the staff is. \nIf you are into Zumba, or you need a towel, or whatever..., maybe go to a bigger gym, but if you are used to going to the gym, you know what you like and use, and don't want to wait forever to use the equipment, then you should  check them out."
0,My wife and I had been patients with this business since 2011-2013. I always had problems with there staff. They always tried  to bill for procedures they knew my insurance wouldn't cover over and over again. I would end up paying the co-insurance considerably higher from what they originally quoted me. \n\n    Ultimately the decision for my wife and I to leave came when she was scheduled for a filling. After the procedure as she was driving home my wife noticed a huge gash on her chin. This part of her chin was numb during the procedure so my wife never felt the dentist literally take a gash out of her face. \n\n    They never said a word to my wife after she left. I hate seeing bad reviews as most of the time it's from people that seem to be rejected food critics but with this business I have to get the word out that they lied to us and were downright unprofessional.
0,"This is Phoenix's attempt to build up a nightlife area downtown.  In my opinion I've seen better.  Here's why:\n\nPros\n+ Yes, there's some variety of restaurants/bars....Tilted Kilt, Arrogant Butcher, Copper Blues, Jimmy John's, Lucky Strikes.\n\n+ It's located near US Airways Center and Chase Field.  Great for pre/post-game partying.\n\n+ For the most part, it's kept clean.\n\n+ The Palomar Hotel is pretty cool.\n\nCons\n- Besides game nights or concert nights, this place is D-E-A-D....a ghost town.  The only people here on those nights are the handful of residents from downtown, and they're no fun at all.\n\n- Parking sucks.  You can park in one of the underground parking structures or hotels nearby valet, which are expensive.....or the surface street parking lots, which are unsafe with no attendants.\n\n- Panhandlers will hit you up for money as you walk around.\n\nIn most cities, the downtown area is a destination for nightlife and fun.  In this case, it's only a destination when there's a special event nearby.  We've stopped coming here on off-nights because it was a waste of time each time we did.  Oh well, maybe someday it will become something better.\n\nReturn Factor - 30%"
0,"I was sooooo looking forward to a great review considering that I visited Zaidi's Grill because of Yelp's reviews.  The people couldn't be nicer so I wish that I had better news.  I wanted beef samosas but they didn't make them anymore.  The chicken patty is also no longer made.  They had pakora's but I don't want vegetables battered and fried. (I'll eat my calories at Hagen Daaz thank you.)  My eating partner had the chicken boti which comes a la carte but they added about a half a cup of rice as a bonus.  Very nice.  We had the roti which was puffy but nothing to write home about.  I had a beef dish (can't remember name)  that consisted of a piece of beef with a sauce that seemed to have file(fee-lay) powder in it --the stuff they use in New orleans to thicken Gumbo.  First, I had to scoop out about 8 tablespoons of oil from the top of the dish onto another dish.  I spent some time doing this so much so that the owner realized what I was doing.  He politely assured me that it was only vegetable oil (as opposed to butter, I guess). I told him that I really didn't want the calories of the oil (also concerned about stomach's reaction to so much fat, but I didn't say this to him).  So all in all, my eating partner had an average meal and I ending up packing the meal and frankly I don't know what I am going to do with it.  By the way, they served a very tasty hot sauce which is house made.  As I said before, the owner/server could not have been nicer.  I was so disappointed considering I adore this type cuisine.  Wish I could have had a better experience.  By the way, there was no one in the dining room on a Friday night.  Not a good sign."
1,It's soooooo good and quick... I Eder the same thing EVERYTIME. Singapore noodle extra extra spicy. Get it & thank me!
0,"With a name like \""Red Velvet Cafe\"", I expected some bomb Red Velvet Cake. Short after walking up to the pastry case, I noticed it's a Vegan place. My BFF is Vegan and I've had many awesome Vegan desserts, so being a carnivore, it didn't steer me away. \n\nAlthough many of the chocolate items looked tempting, I assumed they specialize in Red Velvet, so I ordered their Red Velvet Cupcake, which is $5.50.\n\nIt was topped super high with frosting, so I couldn't wait to dig in!\n\nAs soon as I put my fork in the frosting, to my disappointment, the frosting crumbled into pieces. Sure, it was chilled in the cooler, but it was nowhere near cold enough to crumble in that way. The taste didn't make up for it. Perhaps I was spoiled with the Sprinkes Vegan Red Velvet - you could barely taste the difference between the Vegan frosting and regular Cream Cheese Frosting. The frosting of this cupcake was overly sugary and frankly, cheap tasting.\n\nThe cake was dense and dry... SUPER DRY that I could barely get my fork through it. It had the consistency of dried out cornbread. It tasted like stale chocolate cake. \n\nI ended up tossing it like a hockey puck. I was going to bring it back to the counter, not for a refund but to ask them how they have the nerve to sell something so stale. It had to be more than a week old. I can't imagine otherwise. I didn't bother saying anything. A bad taste was left in my mouth until I reached my favorite dessert spot (not Vegan) Jean Philippe. Now THAT's good Red Velvet. \n\nI gave this place two stars because I feel guilty only giving one, but that's really all it deserves. \n\nMessage to the management - If you specialize in Red Velvet, it should be made fresh daily. If that was fresh, you may want to find another talent. Sorry. :("
0,"I felt the entire experience was deceptive, misleading and manipulative of people in a compromised position. The show up 1 hour late..  They are scammer I end up paying 180$ after all the fees. They told me 19$ service fee and another 23$ to get open and end up paying 180$!!!! This is a scam.. Don't be a victim....."
1,Stopped by today and picked up a tasty juice. Very friendly people and willing to help you out. Juice is on the more expensive side at $12 for 15ML. but the flavors are very tasty so I picked one up because it was unique. Probably won't visit often because of the price - but a very friendly place and has a great social area for hanging out.
1,"I just love pita jungle.\n\nIt's one of those places you can count on.  The atmosphere is cool, the food is good (and everyone can find something they can eat - vegetarian, etc.), and they have really good green tea arnold palmers :)\n\nI try to order something new every time I go to Pita Jungle, you can never go wrong with any of their items.  The falafel, the lentil and rice salad (i forget the name), the hot chicken pita, the fruit salad, the black bean burger...they're all so good!  Oh! And make sure to order the red pepper hummus as a starter with sliced cucumbers for dipping, along with the pita bread.\n\nThe forever changing art on the walls from different local artists adds character along with the tattooed staff (love it!).\n\nThe only thing I can think to change is the quality of the outdoor seating and the crappy strip mall location, but I guess that makes it a literal diamond in the rough!\n\nSee you soon pita jungle ;)"

0,Ive been to so many qdoba's and I have never had an experience quite like this. They had terrible service....dont waste your time or money. The employees were rude and unwilling to fix a problem with my meal. I was so upset with this treatment that I will NEVER eat there again. Go to the chipotle next door...
1,"This yogurt is as good as it gets. Plus, they are fair and reasonable to the consumer, with prices at 37\u00a2 per ounce which is OK in a day and age where cute little yogurt shops are opening and trying to get like 44\u00a2 per ounce. The store is always clean and fresh, and they have a wonderful selection of flavors, constantly changing. The staff is friendly and nice, and they offer a great variety of toppings. Their toppings bar is kept clean and cold, and is the best one in Phoenix. I'd like to request that the owners put up allergens warnings on their machines if the yogurt contains eggs or nuts. Updated Jan 2015: Still our favorite yogurt place. Great flavors, friendly staff. Nice going Yogurtland!"
1,"My boyfriend and I have dined here twice! We absolutely love it. The first time, we were with a vegetarian group (his family is indian) and the P.U.B. was very accommodating! We will defiantly be going back. Their salads are just Meh... But what else should I expect from a Pub?? I wont hold that against them since their french fries are sooo yummy :)"
0,"AquaTouch is a cool place to visit. But most of the products are overpriced. For example if you want to buy a pack of 9L ADA Aquasoil, it will be $53 a pack as of today. But if you get it online, it will only be $30 plus shipping, which is about $10 cheaper\n\nAlso, the past couple times I went in to buy things, I felt so unwelcome because I was with my toddler son. Staffs will greet everybody else in the shop or those who walk in after us but my son and I, we were like invisible to them, and I didn't get any help until after I stood in front of the counter for 10 minutes. Seriously, they think every one who walks in with kids will be a irresponsible parent to let the kids run around the shop on his or her own and destroy everything. \n\nI really hope that they will improve their customer service in the future."
0,"It is my first & last stop here ! They are horrible ! I ordered fry fish & Chopped steak, which should come with mushroom & steamed veggies ..... Yes, chopped steak they brought it was humbugger patty with horrible mushroom gravy and canned carrots ..... all food love for 10.95..... Really???? Humbugger patty... I said thanks, it is not what I ordered @ what written on menu ... Waitress charged me 50% of my plate , which she took back!!!!!! Wow! Fish was sooooo greasy & French frys sooooo dark which swimmed in old oil !!!!! OMG !!!! I had to actually fight & tell them to fix a bill. Will I be back there??????? Yeah, no guesses!!!! Hell nooooooo"
1,"Went here for a couple of drinks on a Tuesday night. The drinks were good and had decent prices. The bar tender was also very helpful. I guess Hanny's is opened by the same people who brought us AZ88 which makes me want to come back and try the food. They are also one of the only restaurants in downtown Phoenix serving food past 10om. Who knew?? I would also recommend going to the bathroom before you get a few drinks in you. Just like AZ88, the bathrooms here are a major part of the restaurant experience. There are no tvs here which I kind of liked."
0,"This place was recommended by a friend, I must say, I was highly disappointed. I came with my family and we all had the same opinion of the food, which was \""not very good\"". Their fried rice was just white rice cooked with soy sauce. Their crispy chicken was not crispy, but soggy. Sesame chicken was soggy as well and both reeked of vinegar, not appetizing. Although just a few dishes tried, I don't think we'll be coming back."
1,"I've been to the original Hofbrauhaus and while definitely not the same, this place is still very enjoyable. Huge HB beers, multitudes of sausage, and their wonderful sauerkraut makes me happy. The $9,95 daily lunch specials all looked good as well. Do a Jager shot and they spank you, supposedly. Its a pretty cheap cab ride from the strip and a nice getaway from the constant slot machine clingclongbeepchingdingdings."
0,"As a beginner triathlete, I was in desperate need of a road bike....especially since I have a few races already on the calendar.  I'm a swimmer, I'm a runner, but I'm NOT a biker......so the whole idea was intimidating.  As was the idea of buying a road bike.  BUT, after saving up and doing some research I was off....  \n\nFirst stop, Landis.  I entered the store and was greeted by a person at the counter.  When I said I wanted to buy a road bike (making it clear I was here to purchase and not just browse), he went to find another person to help me.  I was asked my price range, and yes, I get it, $900 doesn't get me fancy but hey, I didn't want fancy.  He couldn't show me anything on the floor in my size, so he called the Scottsdale store to see their availability.  After maybe 10 mins he comes back to tell me they have the least expensive Trek bike for women but it's in a box and not built.  \n\nOkaaaaay......???\n\nSilence from my sales associate.\n\nFinally he says, well, you could have them build it for you and call you when it's done.\n\nOkaaaay.....???\n\nSilence from my sales associate.  \n\nOkaaaaay.....thanks for your help.\n\n\nI can only describe this customer service as snobby and uninterested.  Sorry I'm a beginner.  Sorry I'm not a man.  Sorry I don't have $1500 to spend on a road bike.  But I was there to buy, and was very disappointed in the way I was treated.\n\nSide note:  At my second stop, Performance Bike (see review), I encountered another woman buying a road bike who had been to Landis earlier that day.  And we both received the same customer service.  Apparently, women who are beginners are not welcome there.  Very disappointing."
0,Took the girls there and basically they said all the clothes was ugly or for grandmas. The girl seemed to have a little attitude on her that a guy came with the ladies to shop. Basically it was like a expensive thrift store with clothes that would normally be at the bottom of your closet. Unless your really bored or in the mood to be disappointed I wouldn't go. Maybe Patty needs to get a clue what is in right now and definitely fire the little skank at the register.
1,"First off, this whole review is based off To-Go, so I just wanted to note this.....\n\nI grew up in New York and just moved to Charlotte from just outside New York City....basically Italian Central!  I have ate a ton of great Italian food and am Italian myself.\n\nWhen I walked into Portofino, I felt like I was back in Westchester!  Slices on the counter, garlic knots....all of the good stuff.\n\nI have not had the pizza, but have tried a few dinners.  The stuffed shells were awesome, and included a huge portion!  The chicken Parm was great, and again huge portion.  All meals are served with a salad (delicous homemade \""house\"" dressing and a full small loaf of freshly baked bread.\n\nThis place is in a somewhat sketch plaza on Eastway.....it's kinda weird that it's there, but that doesn't really matter!  It is my new \""Go to\"" Italian spot when I want a taste of home."
1,"Great Mexican fast foods restaurant,  prices are fair and servings are great. Taco Bell,  Del Taco pale in comparison.  Has regular employees that are good to us regulars. As a family we eat there atleast once a week.  Great deals on tacos and burros on Monday s and Tuesdays. Student specials too"
0,"For $60.00 I could have feed five people at the Golden Coral & would have gotten better steaks. \nThe waitress laughed at me when I used my cell phone to illuminate the plates. Seeing as the lighting was too dim to even see the plate. My date's steak has so much fat he had to re-carve the darn thing with each and every bite. He left more than half on the plate. The steak I ordered was old, not aged. I had sat in the cooler far too long. The edges were cooked well but the inside of the meat was gritty and worse than burnt meat. The tomato garnish was so bitter and sour it turned my stomach.\nThe iced tea was weak. The potatoes were edible compared to the steaks.\nThe music was good."
1,Have been enjoying the food here for years now only to find that it just closed up last week.\n\nSure hope it opens up again and soon because the good there was excellent!
1,Had lunch here today. Went with the sushi which is always fresh and tasty. I usually go there at dinner but was in the area at noonish so I stopped in. As usual service and food were great.
0,"I COMPLETELY agree with Sue! Let me count the ways...\n\nI began to start going to this Dr's office 4-5 years ago when they received a Top Doctors nod in the 2008 Phoenix Magazine, a nod I have not seen for them in some time. I made an appointment with Dr. Brown and was immediately pushed off onto the only Derm that seems to actually be there, Dr. Anngela Park.  I've seen her for a variety of skin issues, mole checks, acne, Accutane, etc. I have ALWAYS felt like a paycheck to the office, but didn't care because I didn't come there often.  It all started with the Accutane...\n\nAfter taking Accutane for 3-4 months, I began to realized that on my 6' frame, my joints were starting to hurt.  Like, REALLY HURT.  I did some research online and saw information stating that previous people who had taken Accutane had the same results with about  half returning to normal after cessation of Acctutane, and half keeping the pain.  As a 26 year old woman with no end to the acne in sight, I decided to continue with the Accutane until the 6 month mark and stop to see if my acne had subsided and stop the pain on my joints.  I mentioned this to Dr. Park in an appointment and she made a rather blanket statement to me saying that I was wrong. No evidence, no conversation other than \""I haven't seen that, so I don't agree.\"" ?????? What???? Nothing in my life had changed, no other medications were being taken, no accidents happened, I didn't all the sudden start working out vigorously, I ate right and was doing what I had always been doing??? Being an educated young woman with a graduate degree, I hate being told that my beliefs are unfounded and are wrong, when no conversation takes place, no research is done, nothing.  If I make a statement and the Dr. says, \""No, you're wrong, I haven't seen that\"", that REALLY bothers me.  It tells me that just because you haven't seen it, it doesn't exist to you.  Poor, poor thinking as a medical professional.  \nP.S. It was MOST DEFINITELY from the Accutane, and about 1.5 years later, the pain is VERY much still in my wrists at the bare minimum and I will probably have SERIOUS issues with those wrists, but I traded the pain of cystic acne for joint pain. What can you do?\n\nLet's also state that even when I go in to see them midday on a weekday, arriving ON TIME, I ALWAYS have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes. Once I had to wait 45 minutes during a lunch break for work where I had allotted just over an hour.  Driving to there, waiting for 45 mins, waiting in the back room for 10, seeing the Dr, for 5, and and driving back cost me AN HOUR AND A HALF. BAH!!!  This place has NO regard for timeliness and I believe I see less and less patients in the waiting rooms over the years #1 because of the economy, but #2 because nobody likes bull appointment times. \n\nThe final problem was the branchial cyst on my neck.  I had a small pinhead sized mass under the skin that was NO big deal, but whenever I got sick (flu, a viral infection, etc) it would swell up to the size of a shooter marble. It had been there for two years with no problems and then it swelled and HURT, BAD.  I made an appointment to come in for the first time in like a year or so.  Waiting in the waiting room for 15 minutes, (not a patient's soul in the waiting room or in the back?). I come up to pay my specialist fee of $40 before I may enter.  A sign should hang above the door stating \""Abandon all hope ye who enter here\"" because do NOT expect any sort of a good experience.  \n\nI went to the back and waited for another 10 minutes while I heard the Dr. talk outside my paper thin door about personal things that could have waited with no other patients there, then proceeded to debrief the intern, loudly, about me outside my door. COME IN?! I can hear you, so at least ignore me in person when you talk about me. She comes in, checks me out, and says \""You're not going to like this\"". \n\nDO NOT EVER START A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS IF YOU ARE A DOCTOR!!! HOW DARE YOU!!!!\n\nMy heart sinks, and she tells me... \""I can't remove that, you're going to have to see a specialist\"". Then why, praytell, did I just pay a SPECIALIST $40 fee for you???? So basically she eludes to me to go somewhere else, I'm not getting my $40 back for her horrible advice. (Which consisted of the word \""Otolaryngologist\"" scratched onto a piece of paper).  No names, no Dr.'s they work closely with.  Just making me pay $40 for what I could have found out online, but assumed your SPECIALISM would remove a 1cm cyst from just under the skin of my neck???  Then she proceeds to tell me that I need to see a family practice Dr. to get a referral.\n\nYEAH RIGHT!!!!!\n\nContinued on next review..."
1,"I decided to go back to The Rusty Onion today, and I was quite impressed. My boss went earlier this afternoon and was astonished by how good of a time he had there (after about 3-4 of his own terrible lunch trips to The Rusty Onion), and he recommended that I try it. He was so certain that my experience would be a good one that he said he would pay for my meal if it went otherwise.  My server was Cory and she was well versed in the specials and was very sweet. Eric and the hostess came by a few times to make sure that my food was good as well. Overall, the service was EXCELLENT! The food was delicious as well! I finally had the experience I had hoped for since they first opened. Can't wait to try the gluten free pizza next time. If you've had a bad experience at this restaurant, I definitely recommend giving it a second try."
1,"Broccolini, spicy peppers, and thin crust pizza. You combine three of my favorite things and you get the Rocket Man. So very good. LGO manages to keep its wood fired crusts substantial and bready, yet never, ever flaccid (unlike other so-called wood fired pizza joints *ahem*Bianco*cough*Cibo). \n\nI'm knocking off a star because the place is always yuppie pandemonium, and you have to watch your ass in the parking lot because it's full of Range Rovers driven by women who don't know how to maneuver a large vehicle. But, they get part of that star back for the adjacent gelato shop. Perfection."
1,"I would bring a date here!\n\nThe food is Cajun style with that New Orleans motif for decor.  The service was on point (good), and seating was more than adequate!  We asked for beads to darn on ourselves ---- and they brought us some!  The food is spicy as is Cajun style and the selections are terrific.  They serve alcohol and other libations...\n\nThe location is a bit outside of Phoenix Proper, but if you are looking for that Cajun effect---This is a good place to start.  \n\nAs a bonus, they gave us a gift card for $5 off our next visit...This was a nice evening to say the least...I recommend it.\n\nFour stars: One for decor, one for how the food tasted!  One for service, and one for price (reasonable)."
0,1 Star for me actually going to a different gas station and 1 star for the cheaper gas at this station versus the one by my house.\n\nOtherwise- YUCK! This place is dirty dirty dirty. I reached down to grab the gas pump handle and my hand almost got stuck to it because it was so sticky and gross. I know this is a gas station and those pump handles are gonna be dirty but I shouldn't have to bring gloves with me to get gas.\n\nThe trash was also overflowing at the pump. It looked like they never come outside and clean up. Maybe it was too hot for them. =) \n\nI did not go inside and thank god. I can only imagine what that looked like. They should have a clean outside and it will be more inviting for people to go in and get other things. They are definitely losing money because of this Who knows? I may have went in and bought something if it was cleaner.
0,My family likes to meet here.  I've yet to have a meal I really even liked here.  The service was fine but I just don't ever really leave satisfied.
1,"This is a humble eatery, a pleasant surprise in the midst of a sordid neighborhood. The restaurant is choc-a-bloc on a weekend evening. So it is best to arrive around 7 pm, not later than that.\n\nAs indicated on their menu they start preparing the food only after the order is placed leading to a considerably long wait (45 mins to one hour). However, during the waiting period their customers have quite a few occupations like looking at the paraphernalia on the walls, sipping margaritas, devouring the crunchy tacos, listening to the loud Spanish music or looking at what other people are eating. \n\nWhatever their clients choose to do, there comes a time when the waiter places the hot plate on the table, they pick up the fork, take a mouthful and then there is calm in the din of Los Dos Molinos. In fact there is a near- Nirvana experience with every bite of the carnitas or enchiladas. \n\nAt the end the brusque manner of the waiting staff is forgotten, so is the long wait and restlessness."
0,"I have two great dane puppies and was looking to get them their vaccinations and set up to be neutered.\n\nThey offer pet prevention plans which if you sign up for can save you an additional 10-15% additional services.  While for the most basic things this is a rather reasonable expense.  However, one of the pups magically contracted Parvo after being vaccinated for it.\n\nThey wanted to charge me $800 in random tests to find out what was wrong.  I said no and asked them to do 1 test at a time until they found out what was wrong.  Which once Parvo came back positive that saved me nearly 600 dollars.  Seeing as they were the clinic the pups have been seen the most at I continued to use their services to treat Parvo.  A highly contagious and extremely deadly disease.  They used no precautions in handling my dog (gloves, bib, protective gear).  Which scarily may have put other dogs at great risk.  He spent 2 days getting fluids, amoxicillian shots, and anti nausea medicine. I can't speak of him being quarantined or isolated for the safety of other dogs coming in.  All said and done we spent over $1000 dollars in hydrating our dog with 4 anti nausea pills and a bottle of amoxicillian.  Since we were adamant on being consulted before running other various tests that were unnecessary.  After researching and making a few phone calls we asked for an X-Ray to be done at the closing hours. They obliged and ran x-rays after hours for us.  They came back with a blockage and possible intestinal twist scare. They advised us to take our pet to a local emergency pet hospital after spending 2 days in their \""hospital\"". \n\nThe people were friendly but very busy and they were frequently over run with people waiting. Which is part of life, but when our dog has Parvo we should have been informed from the start to keep him isolated and not be walking him through the store. \n\nThe main Dr was very friendly and she did seem knowledgeable but this is a very business oriented place that over charges for some very basic things.   \n\nThe emergency hospital visit is by far more expensive, but we have essentially lost 2 days and $1000 dollars worth of services that could of gone to an establishment better equipped to handle the illness that is very time sensitive and early treatment is critical for our dogs survival. \n\nI highly recommend going to a real vet office."
0,"Stopped in here while traveling for work. The sushi sign in the window caught my eye. It's a small dining room, but the decor is nice.\n\nThe gal at the door was friendly, but my server seemed almost annoyed by me.  She did the basics, but didn't refill my water until she brought my bill.  She also didn't bother to mention their happy hour specials and brought me the special menu only after I asked.\n\nI had the blackened chicken and shrimp with veggies.  It had a peppery teriyaki flavor.The chicken was great, but the shrimp was over cooked.  Overall it was pretty decent, but nothing super special.  I had half a california roll as my side dish and it was not so great.  It had artificial crab that just had a strange taste.\n\nIn the end I left full and satisfied, but I don't think i'd go back."
0,"I guess compared to the DMV I'd call this place fun, but I wouldn't describe it as enjoyable experience for me. I saw it on TV and it looked intriguing enough to give it a try. I lasted about 5 minutes and I was bored (and in a bit of pain). Perhaps I'm too germ-phobic, but landing face first in the co-mingled sweat of hundreds of people was a bit much for me as well.. Next stop was CVS for a full body scrub down with hand sanitizer."
0,"All I have to say is what you see on the menu is not what you're gonna get. and if you're ok with cockroaches on the walls and floors, the this is the place to eat."
1,"Stayed here in Dec. 2005. Average rooms and good environment, although empty casino, although that didn't matter for me because I'm not 21 yet. Again, like the Rio Hotel, the hotel room I had had available AV connections in the TV so you can connect your DVD player for the kids. The buffet wasn't that good. I had better. But if it's cheap, it's a good hotel to sleep in on the LV Strip.\n\nRIP Stardust Hotel"
1,"After a rocky start this AM when someone came into our room at 6:45 AM the assistant Front Desk manager, Robert S, a customer service superstar upgraded us to a bigger better suite in response and sincerely apologized - we had a stellar day at the pool and then at the Blackjack tables! \nStarting to love New York New York Las \nVegas again."
0,"First time we went to that place.  There was a sign saying \""seat yourself\"".  Well after more than 10 minutes, still no services.  We just left and don't think we'll go back there."
1,After spending my morning in the office I decided to explore a bit and grab a bite to eat. I stumbled upon this place and I couldnt be happier with the whole experience. Amazing food and amazing people.
1,"My family came here a few days ago, and for myself and my sister, it was our first time having Hawaiian cuisine. My sister and I had the loco moco and my mom had the hoisin sauce ribs. The portions are just HUGE. My loco moco had huge scoops of rice, a good sized beef patty, the fried egg and a pool of gravy. I loved it. My mom's ribs were juicy and tender it was so much that we ended up eating the leftover's for dinner that night. The price was right for the portions as well, a little under $9 for each entree. My mom also said her coffee was the best she'd had in ages."
1,"We stayed here for 10 days in between moving out of a home and into a new one.  The location is good...many restaurants and grocery stores around.  The room wasn't anything special...bed, bathroom, kitchenette.  It was clean and the service was great.  The only issue we had was the toilet kept running.  We got maintenance to change a part but it didn't fix the issue.  They came three times and it didn't work any time so we just left it."
1,"We only had a milkshake, but darnit, it was the BEST shake ever. It was cherry and chocolate and alcohol. What more could you want! Also, its enough to split, so $5 a person doesn't seem so bad."
0,"I always shopped at this store when it was in Boca park, so when i found out that one was closing and i'd have to go to the Centennial Hills location I was a bit annoyed bc its kinda far away... Last week i wanted to pick up a football jersey and a few hats so i thought i'd drive out to that location.  I wanted to try on a jersey and the guy acted like he was annoyed.... whatever i got over it...  I ended up buying myself and my fiance hats and a few other things with our hometown decal on it... I did ask the guy that was working if i would be able to return the hat if it didn't fit my fiance he said yeah no problem. Ends up the hat didn't fit so i just took it back today a week later bc today is my day off, anyways i go in and tell the guy i want to return the hat bc it didn't fit.... He starts huffing and puffing and gets an attitude right away. I say \""what's wrong?\"" he starts to get loud and says UGHHHHHH this hat has been worn... I say NO IT HASNT he tried it on and thats it... So he goes on and on about how he's still going to return it for me even though ITS BEEN WORN saying over and over again and being a TOTAL DICK... \n\nif your going to return something for a customer don't be rude to them JUST RETURN IT YOU DICK!!! You just lost a good customer who always shopped at your store instead of going to a huge corporate store like champs or Lids..."
0,"My first reaction was that the food was kind of expensive.  There were recognizable barbecued meats, but it seemed more liked they were cooked on the kitchen grill than one of the barbecue variety.  There was a good variety of Barbecue sauces from around the country."
0,The gym itself is nice The staff are nice and helpful but look out for the finance company Jonas Fitness. They are absolutely awlful to deal with. I would give Golds a 4 if they did not work with Jonas Fitness. They have been caught in lies about payments and are quick to charge overdraft fees that are a nightmare to straighten out. This company cheapens the brand name golds gym world wide. The nicest thing I can say about Jonas Fitness is they are repulsive and have no idea of what character and integrity means. If there are any words stronger. Consider them said.

1,"Flaming Kabob in three words: yum and cheep.\n\nI have eaten here several times since moving to Tempe, and I'm a fan.  Their food is tasty, quick, made-to-order, and inexpensive.  Plus, they have GREAT hours!\n\nI'd like it if they'd go a bit easier on the tzatziki on their gyros, but it's no deal breaker."
0,"For the past 5 years, we have been going there every single Friday, but NO MORE! We were mistreated and yelled at by THE OWNER!!! She was stressed and overwhelmed  with COSTUMERS instead of happy to have business. She couldn't keep track of the amount of ice cream cone she had served and decided it was better to scream at her clients for her mistakes and negligence. All this misbehaving on her part was done in front of children and new trainees!!! NICE!!! We will GLADLY take our business somewhere else where they do appreciate loyal customers and decent families."
1,"Unpretentious, ... nothing fancy at all,  Taco and Burritos , this place is just a neighborhood restaurant with great food. I have been waited on by the 12 year old kid behind the counter,  ... the decor' is nothing to write home about, but all of this is what adds to the charm of the hole in the wall treasure!"
0,"Terrible, terrible experience at Portrait Innovations today. My family has been loyal to this studio since 2010, initially starting out at their now closed Scottsdale location and moving with them way down south to Chandler - 35 mins drive. We were happy with their backgrounds, props, staff (especially Kelly), and prints. \n\nAll this is sadly a thing of the past. Their 2014 Christmas special brought us in and our photographer was John - a cool guy who got several nice shots. The people at the front desk obviously weren't paid to smile - why should they, it's only a photo place, right? They neither made us feel welcome or at ease.\n\nWhile waiting our turn, we noticed how dirty and gross the furniture was. Absolutely disgusting. What a way to welcome your customers.\n\nTheir monitors you view the photos on are really poor. Old Pioneer TVs - very grainy, pixelated. Neither 720 or 1080 HD, probably just 480 resolution - like your old tube TVs. They are pretty crappy to view photos on - you can't tell if the shot is in focus, lightning overexposed, or if the contrast is right.\n\nWhen we got the prints, the trouble really began. The quality was abysmal - even the prints I get at Walgreens are better! There was no contrast, the picture was overexposed, skin tones were grey, the color temperature was way cold with very little saturation. I would be embarrassed to send those Christmas cards to family or hang the prints on the wall. \n\nEven worse, the attitude from the staff was ice-cold and completely arrogant. The prints were awesome, in their opinion. Yes, they didn't match the examples they have available on the counter because \""those had been photoshopped\"" (which they don't offer to customers), they were with a different background, and with different lighting. I even spoke to a manager, which was like speaking to a robot. Repeated the same empty rhetoric, essentially putting the blame on us for choosing the snowflake background. \n\nEventually, we ended up (reluctantly) asking for a refund. I even asked twice if there wasn't ANYTHING they could do (maybe calibrate the printer?) but no. Loyalty and past experiences didn't matter to them. No offer to retake the shots, nothing. \n\nNeedless to say, I recommend staying far away from these amateurs. Choose quality. It's photos and memories - they deserve better than grainy, pixelated, overexposed photos with weird color tones."
1,"Being on the strip for only less than a couple of years I have to give credit where credit is due to the new casino in town. This fellas is a casino to go to if your in a relationship or trying to impress a lady. To the decor to the layout, shops and stores, this place takes the cake on being a modern wonder casino. Koi on the 3rd floor is a hidden gem for out door pools onlooking the whole Vegas strip. Wicked Spoon is probably one of the best buffet I ever had in my life and its' uniqueness will blow you away.\n\ndp"
0,These people are clueless. I have confirmed multiple appointments over the phone. Only to get emails confirming completely different products than I had spoken about. Even to the point of denying I had an appointment over email but confirming on the phone. It's really scary that people like this are in business.  Stay away. And don't even think about calling them.
1,"PAUL is the Pet Shop owner we bought Jerry in Dec 2013. My husband and I had just married and wanted our first Puppy. A 2 1/2 month old English Bulldog - Paul did an amazing Job guiding us with what we needed and how to raise the dog. Originally I had gone in there for a FRENCH bulldog and I was financed for 0 interest 6 months. But then we changed our mind and decided to get an English - Paul and Calvin had no problem changing all the paperwork for Jerry!\n\nThe initial fee you pay is more than you would pay buying from craigslist / or maybe a breeder, but he has all paper work, and he pays for the first 4 shots that they puppies needs - also covers anything major if the puppy become sick within the first year!!\nAND MY DOGS ARE FULL BREED, I didn't have to wonder if I was getting scammed!\n\nI went in there 2 months later to buy some more food, and bought another English bulldog a FEMALE who I named Jodie- MY DOGS ARE MY KIDS, they are best friends and we couldn't be more happier with them!! ALL IN ALL 10 OUT OF 10 GREAT EXPERIENCE !!"
1,Ok so arriving here I get in my room and its dirty nice but dirty so I look a round and there is stains on the floor and I found a used cutip in the bathroom and the bed is a pull up bed if you don't know what that is it is a bed the you can push up and then it looks like a closet that's what it is the staff always seem like ther new and the room service is ok they have some good things on the menu and the griffin club is something you don't need the hotel is good but no cigar.
1,"Since most things in my life have the shelf life of a diary product, I felt the Dailey Method deserved an update. Why? Because I am close to approaching the 6 month mark of being part of The Dailey Method...and I can't believe it!!!\n\nThis is one of the most beautiful, graceful, yet OH SO effective workouts. When building up strength, it's easy to get discouraged at times. But, I can guarantee anybody who sticks it out with dedication for the first month will continually see themselves improve. Then, one day you'll be surprised to find yourself getting stronger and pushing yourself to new levels!\n\nThe Dailey Method owner is so passionate and has such a talent for what she does, it spreads like wildfire to her instructors and onto her students. I cannot speak highly enough of Linda and her crew and the incredible amount of support they have given me.\n\nMy motto in life is that the world would be a better place if more people focused on making themselves happy and whole. The Dailey Method has been an instrumental 'new' part of my life to help me be stronger...not only physically, but mentally. I know many Methoders who would agree. What is there to lose? While you're enjoying your new booty, you can also pride yourself knowing you look darn smart too!!"
1,Stopped here for a sweet treat and did not regret it! The ice cream was amazing. The staff was distracted by some friends in the store but were attentive enough...
1,"I was given a second chance to try CHoP in Chandler and last nights experience was completely different than my first. \n\nLet's start with the staff, last night (a week day evening so the restaurant was busy but not overly crowded) they all were on their game. Our glasses were constantly being refilled, plates were taken away at the appropriate times and the table was checked on often to make sure things were coming out to our liking. \n\nAppetizer: Downtown Fries ($9) - the fries were cooked well, not soggy or overdone. They were seasoned properly and the spicy aioli that come with the fries was great. \n\nEntree: Barbecue Baby Back Ribs ($24) - it has been a while since I have had good ribs. These were fall off the bone delicious! The barbecue sauce was sweet and had a little bit, the meat was tender and not fatty like some ribs can be. I would order these again and recommend them too! \n\nDessert: Pecan Torte ($7) - the pecans were crispy and the combo with the vanilla ice cream and the butterscotch sauce tied this little dessert together. A tasty little dessert to share as it is rich. \n\nEverything I had last night was on par, the service was up to snuff like a steakhouse should be. Bravo to the staff, chef's and management who made last night a lovely dinning experience."
1,"For good dim sum in Las Vegas, you probably won't find a much better place than Orchids Garden.  Because of their all day dim sum dining, the place is steadily busy!\n\nWe finally decided to try Orchids Garden because we kept hearing about it.  There are a ton of places on Spring Mountain that cater to the dim sum crowd but Orchids Garden off of Sahara kept coming up.  Off to dim sum we go!\n\nThe lady and I went on a Saturday for lunch time and it was no joke, the restaurant was full!  There were people shouting and whistling as carts full of wonderful dim sum were whizzing around the dining area.  There was steam and foul-sounding \nChinese language everywhere!  Definitely nice to see the hustle and bustle.  Gotta get your dim sum order in before the cart runs out and you have to wait!\n\nAfter being seated we were given a regular restaurant menu and the dim sum menu.  It was a nice touch, prices were given in categories, and pictures were used for the various dim sum to make it easier for patrons who are not familiar with the art of dumplings.  I've watched dim sum making before, and damn, it truly is an art because you gotta be patient and be able to put out quality dim sum in almost no time flat.  Oh my aching hands!\n\nOrchids Garden dim sum is fairly priced.  Still a bit more than dim sum from places like Cali, but not bad for Vegas standards.  All dim sum dishes range from around $2 - $6 area, and there is something for just about everyone.  Me?  I love sticking to the cheap, cheap, cheap end of the dim sum spectrum.  I think all dim sum should be cheap!  It's supposed to be akin to street food!  Who the heck wants to pay $6 for friggin' Chinese broccoli?  I don't.  Some of our faves:\n\n-Steamed chicken feet (love it)\n-Steamed BBQ pork bun\n-Pan fried daikon cake\n-Baked BBQ pork bun (yummy)\n-Shrimp har gow\n-Pan fried chives dumpling (chive-y)\n-Beef in rice noodle\n-Mushroom shiu mai\n\nThe chicken feet here are fantastic!  Sticky, fatty, and delicious with a bowl of hot white rice.  We employ multiple orders of this whenever we go.  I am also a big fan of the chives dumpling since I am an onion lover.  Each of the dim sum above is in the $2 - $4 range for each serving.  Not too cheap but not so expensive it breaks the bank.  I've had better dim sum in other places but I think for Las Vegas it is pretty good.  Not to mention, dim sum all day?  It appeals to a lot of (drunk @$$)people here.  \n\nI've seen the restaurant menu but have yet to try anything off of it.  But it does have a massive amount of choices which is good.  But for now, dim sum me up...baby!\n\nVerdict?  Orchids Garden is a good spot for some decent dim sum.  They are fast, effective, and your dim sum comes out nice and steamy.  Service for us was OK, although some folks say the service can be a bit rude.  But then again, Chinese restaurants aren't always known for having the best service.  So the next time you have a dim sum craving and can't decide where to go, give Orchids Garden a try.  Just remember, it's off of Sahara and not Spring Mountain!"
0,"I kept hearing about this place. People told me their burgers were better than Five Guys. Alas, I do not hold the same regard. I found Smashburger's burgers greasy. Maybe some people enjoy this. I did not. Also, their burgers didn't have a great flavor. Their buns were quite soggy as well. The fries (and I sampled all 3 varieties) were mediocre at best. I'll stick to other burger places from now on."
0,"I was disappointed many times over with this place, but let me tell you first about the one thing I did enjoy. The chocolate filled croissant. It was very flaky, buttery, and good (however Fresh & Easy makes some in their bakery too which is cheaper and just as good).\n\nI ordered the Croque Madame and asked for no tomato due to an allergy. I was told that the food was pre packaged (I assume she may have meant pre made) and that I would need to remove it myself. My friend ordered a burger. We grabbed our water glasses, found a table, and started to share the croissant.\n\nWe waited for more than 20 minutes for our food to be brought to our table and upon arrival it looked very unappetizing and possibly even pre packaged like promised. My friends burger was over cooked and the potato salad he got was reported to me as being 'just okay'.\n\nMy Croque Madame (toast, tomato, cheese, and a fried egg on top) was not good at all. The bread tasted like it had been frozen and then put into a toaster (you know how the edges get super crunchy, but the middle is soggy... it was like that). Trying to get the tomato out became such a chore because of this that I eventually gave up. The egg on top was cooked well, but for as simple as the meal is, I do not understand why 1.) you would have is pre packaged or pre made at all, and 2.) why it takes over 20 minutes to have it ready. Even which my friend ordering a burger, 20 minutes is excessive.\n\nStay away from the caf\u00e9, but the bakery seems to be alright."
1,"I need to update my review.  I went to Nourish tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  In the past the food and my service have just been okay.  Tonight, my protein burger with a side of avocado and sweet potato salad were excellent.  Service was good too.  The menu has changed since the last time I visited too.  I will give this place a few more tries!"
0,"This chocolate shop does not compete to many that I have visited. It is tucked away in one of many corners of Caesers palace so I really dont think its worth an entire trip to visit this shop. I thought the space itself was decorated nicely but the section of pastires wasnt very exciting. They had delicious sandwhiches though but that only because we were really hungry and at $11 per sandwhich I am sure that only covers the cost of the snazzy packaging they serve it in. Espresso and coffees are good but again, nothing to rave about. \n\nThey must work on something a bit more imaginative other than a chocolate santa clause mold and the usual tiramisu to impress a visitor."
1,"Great price for a 5 star hotel, adequate location, and gorgeous room. We were so impressed by the size of the room, service (front desk, housekeeping, and concierge) and free afternoon checkout at 4PM. But, keep in mind that the discounted price you pay for a 5 star hotel is for a reason. You are far from the main part of the strip and it is a LONG walk from the Bellagio to the hotel.\n\nThe pool and hot tubs are fun but nothing to write home about. The pool is big enough to swim laps and the hot tubs were a good temperature.\n\nAll-in-all, 4 star experience in the hotel, 3 star for being far from the \""hot spots\"" and not providing complimentary shuttles to the strip or to the airport.\n\nNote: It is very close to Wynn and Encore but it does affect your overall experience to not have a casino or buffet directly in your hotel. Also, you'll be doing lots of walking if you stay here since taxi's really aren't cheap!"
1,"You know what?  This was a fun night.  Vodka drink specials at $5 each, lots of room to move and dance, friendly bartenders, no problems getting in or out, or finding parking - just everything you would want from a fun night out. \n\nThe DJ played a mix of old school 90s and all modern pop and hip hop music videos and songs.  Great job on the music playlist.  \n\nEvery type of dress code here, from casual to very dressy/sexy.  Bathroom and dance floor was clean and in great condition."
1,"I got to stay here for free, as one of my travel companion's parents had timeshare points we used.   However, as a group of seven costs would have been WAY cheaper than any comparable location on the strip.\n\nWe had a suite which included a one-bedroom and a studio.  There were balconies on both, and we luckily had a view of the strip!  \n\nOne-bedroom breakdown:\n-Full kitchen with supplies (pots, pans, silverware, plates, cups, salt, pepper, sponge, dishwashing liquid, etc)\n-Bathroom with two sinks and big bathtub\n-Dining table + chairs\n-Huge TV\n-Bed and closet in the bedroom\n-Sofabed in the living room\n-Slept 5\nBonus: Ipod dock and speakers...party in the room!\n\nStudio breakdown:\n-microwave, coffeemaker, cups\n-murphy bed\n-bathroom with shower stall\n-large TV, but not as big as the one-bedroom\n-slept 2\n\nThis is more a family place, I can't say we didn't get some strange looks from other patrons strolling through the lobby \""dressed to impress.\""  The staff was very courteous and we never had any sort of problem.\n\nThe pool area is on the smaller side and got very crowded the weekend we stayed, so chairs/chaises/cabanas were all filled up.  However, you can grab all the towels you want and make your own little cushioned area.\n\nA big draw was the kitchen, stop by Von's on your way to stock it up!  There's nothing better than coming back at god-knows-what-hour and microwaving some mac-n-cheese, mmmmmm."
0,"Haven't eaten here in years and decided to try it again since I was working on this side of town. This place isn't what it use to be. It looks the same, but the food is different and the staff aren't very helpful or friendly. Some other post indicated the original owner had sold and you can tell."
1,"We got the annual passes since our daughter loves coming here. Since we don't have other ocean wild life museum or something like that in Vegas, this place suites our purpose for now. Only draw back is that they don't have a separate line for the members at the entrance."

0,"OMG! sushi left on the counter for 30 minutes, then served to us as though it was just made freshly? i think not! the sea eel didn't even look suitable for a photograph, but not wanting to be fussy, i tried it, and quickly spit it out! this place is more of a 1 time visit. i've been several times, and still am not impressed. that was the last try, i hope to never be starved for sushi and stuck by that place again. the service sucks at the bar, it was the bartender who served up the sour sushi too! steer clear from here, you've neen yelped! oh and the big fish tank in the floor? its not all that. although the decor keeps bringing me back-it makes me forget all the previous visits-then i quickly remember when i'm waiting for the sushi.\n\none things fer sure, if ur looking for all those candy pushers, with the burned out Ed Hardy clothes, plastic booby flashing bleached blondes or euro-transplants looking to do anyone that will get them somewhere, well there you go....because its all there."
1,We have been in Vegas for a week. Breakfast here at Mr. Mamas was the best. Food was hot and service was quick and very polite.  We ate here twice during our stay and both times the food was superb. Great place!!!
0,"Terrible experience. Our attendant did not seem to know what he was doing. The booth broke down for a large amount of time. When it was working, the images were severely crooked and blurry. \n\nApproximate downtime 90 minutes\n\n5 Hours = 300 minutes\nPercentage of time down: 30%\n\nTotal separate images: 325\n\nBlurry images: 106\nPercentage of total images blurry: 32%\n\nSeverely crooked images: 213\nPercentage of severely crooked images: 66%\n\nTo be fair, we spoke with customer service after the event. They did refund a significant portion. It took quite a bit of back and forth though to finally come to an agreement. But, again, to be be fair, they did issue a partial refund.\n\nHowever, I guess it's still left a bad taste in our mouths since it was our wedding day. I feel like the whole thing could have been prevented.\n\nI'd recommend avoiding them. Even if everything works the way it's supposed to... it's a really cheap and crummy setup. It looks like someone got a low quality camera and setup a sheet."
1,"I know, a ton of reviews of this place but i find it interesting that people either seem to love it or really just don't get it. It sort of reminds me of when pulp fiction came out and you either thought it was a masterpiece (I did) or just didn't get it. So maybe Casey Moore's is the dining equivalent of pulp fiction. It certainly has that sort of gritty feel to it. However, after my last lunch review I have found myself going back for lunch several times and even for a nosh on an early Sunday evening and...it is all good. On Sunday my friend ordered the curry chicken soup and it was like...wow, everything you would expect out of a curry soup and perfect with a nice salad. At lunch the service continues to be good and the food not only reasonable but it continues to taste great.\n\nNow, I do understand that it has a bit of a different ambiance when it is busier but that that has a certain charm as well though when I really want to enjoy a good beer I find myself wondering over to Taste of Tops to experience one of their ever changing micro-brews. However, for a nice lunch in a dark bar, or hanging out at a happy hour at the end of a week with some friends, it is great for that as well.\n\nAs for the four stars..I will admit, service can be a bit slow but people...learn to catch the eye of your server! Consider it a wonderful opportunity for some training in dining assertiveness and then just enjoy the vibe."
1,"Dropped in here with my wife and toddler on a busy Saturday afternoon. The back room was cozy and they had great comfort food with very friendly staff. As others have noted, it didn't seem like a big tourist spot, which we liked. \n\nDecent selection of beers and whiskies as well. If I came back to Edinburgh and was looking for a cozy pub on the Royal Mile, I would seek this place out again."
1,"I love the pizza here! And they have 1/2 off all pizzas Monday-Thursday from 9-11pm, perfect for late night dinner."
0,"Our server was pretty cranky. We have a large group (8 adults and 5 kids under 4 years of age), which I know can be stressful. But the service was terrible and the food mediocre. There weren't enough table settings (and they never got us any more, so none of the kids had silverware). The only upside is thy the food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly."
0,"NEVER USE THIS CO! quote $135 for 2 hours, the travel time & gas & when they showed up the ppl couldn't even speak English tried 2 make me sign the bill before they started,took them forever 2 load, then when they went to unload they tried charging me extra & there was a 30 min fight about the rates finally when they did unload they broke my king bed frame &rail. they were incredibly rude the owner was a joke. he threatened to drive off w all my stuff. the guys were so scrawny & smelly\nthey didn't even have water. worst experience ever!!"

So. \n\nI got some sort of chicken salad once, and it was disgusting. The lettuce was soggy(gag) and just not good.\n\nThe last time I went, I got the cedar planked salmon, and it was decent.\n\nAn okay place to go if you have few options.\n\nI was going to give this place one star, based on my experiences with TGI Fridays in general, but this actual location is all right...if you don't have many options."
0,"I used to frequent this place 7 years ago, moved away, and went back again last night. The service is still efficient and good, however the noise level in the dining area is very high. If you are looking for a quiet and relaxing meal, this is not the place. \n\nLet's start with the good stuff. The complimentary bread comes out crusty and hot and the flavored spreads were delicious!  The burrata with heirloom tomatoes and arugula with a balsamic dressing was slightly overdressed, but amazing! The little hint of fresh mint in the dressing takes it over the top! The clam chowder was very good. We also had the molten lava cake and crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which were both good, but not exceptional.\n\nNow to the big disappointment. We both had the rib eye steak, medium rare. The seasoning was good, but the outside wasn't crusted or charred enough. The cut of meat was hard to eat with bite after bite of gristle and too much fat. Overall, just a bad cut of meat!  We used to have a manager's special, a double bone-in rib eye for two (that they no longer have available...not to be confused with the one on the menu) that came out sizzling hot and crusty, and was to die for! They need to bring it back!  Their signature potatoes were good, but came out with the cheese already hardened and cold at the top. Tasted like it was made far in advance and dried out. When I cut into the cheese, the top separated like you'd expect with leftovers. The asparagus was very skinny and so tough I couldn't even cut through them with my steak knife. To their credit, our server was happy to replace it with green beans (which were very good).\n\nOverall, we had a pleasant experience, but the main attraction fell short. Where's the beef?!!"

0,"I am not sure about positive customer service reviews here...\nSalon itself is ok: relatively clean and the beds you expect to see in a regular tanning salon. I am from LA myself and work in Phoenix couple days a week, so I needed a quick place to go to to get base tan during the week.\n\nMy awful experience:\nI came in to purchase 10 days unlimited on 11/12, but after associate was raving about their highest level bed I decided to opt out for $45 3 session package.\nWhen I went into the bed I saw there was a massive crack/part of plastic missing in the bed. I have never seen anything like that, so felt uneasy using the bed and stepped out. Well, that's something associate should have warned me about before I went in. When I asked for a refund she told me they don't do refunds (odd) and suggested I try something else. Shed also mentioned she had broken bed inspected and \""its totally ok to use\"" (still, when large piece of plastic is missing you should probably warn the customer).\n\nI agreed to use the lower level instead. Lower level bed did not yield any results so next day I decided to risk it in the bed I purchased. It worked great, though was definitely scary with cracks and bare bulbs.\n\nWhen I came back 2 weeks after associate told me I used up all my sessions and she knows nothing about it. I asked her to look up the days I came in, as expected there were only 2 days I came in on and I bought 3 sessions. She said in the system I was switched to something else and she couldnt do anything about it.\n\nShe did not have manager's contact info, could not give me any refund and could not give me a session per her words. How does one working at a tanning salon have no manager contact info? What if there is fire? Someone burned? Inspection came in? Robbery happened?\n\nAlso phrases like \""I don't care\"", \""I can't do anything about it\"", \""Maybe she will call you\"" - are not acceptable in service industry in this context.\n\nI am extremely displeased and disappointed. If manager chooses to limit what their associates can do to resolve issues such as refunds, comping sessions, changing things in the system - they should either be on site of accessible 100% of time.\n\nBest,\nNataliya"
0,Worst chipotle eve!! Every time I've been here seems they are getting stingier and stingier with their meats. Not even a full scoop! Might as well start weighing every serving rather than you making the decision for me. PINCHING PENNY RESTAURANT.  You dont get what you pay for. Never coming back
1,"Clean, polite (even when nearly closed) staff, and FAR larger portions than expected.  Definitely a fan of the franchise now."
0,"This is a fairly large restaurant, as it has a dive bar inside, a downstairs patio area, and an upstairs bar and rooftop seating.  It's unfortunate that the food and service were sub-standard.  I'm not sure if it was our group of 12 that made the service lacking, but it wasn't busy at all for a Wednesday night and the service was rather slow.  The food was lacking as well.  The hummus was okay - flavor wasn't as potent as typical hummus.\n\nPrices are fair, but this place is probably one of the worse dining venues in Old Town Scottsdale.  The other one would be Italian Grotto."

0,"I had Cox TV, Internet and landline phone installed into my home in September 2013. By November I noticed that my Internet's service speed had degraded to 5 MB per second download instead of the 25 MB per second I was paying for. I called Cox and had a service tech come to my home. The service tech examined the situation and told me the Cox service tech who had earlier installed the equipment did not use the proper cable couplers and that was the cause of the problem. I watched the tech install new cable couplers in the Smart box and reboot the system. The fix worked and my internet speed increased significantly. \n\nI got my Cox bill today and I noticed a $39.99 service charge. I called Cox and spoke to a customer service rep who told me the service ticket read \""Installer #5145 reset modem and internet works fine\"". I shared with the customer service rep what really happened, and protested that why should I have to pay for a mistake made by an earlier Cox installer. The customer service rep transferred me to supervisor #T16512, who told me that there is nothing she could do because the work order write up indicated the charge was valid. \n\nTotal time on phone was 44 minutes 99% of which was being placed on hold. \n\nI will be switching from Cox this week. \n\nBottom line is they are a bunch of crooks!"
1,"This place is one of my FAVORITE places to eat in Az. Anytime out-of-town friends come by, I always take them to Joe's to show off this little gem of a restaurant. First off, the food is AMAZING. I've had pretty much everything on the menu, and still have yet to be disappointed. I love the grilled veggie pizza, as well as the BBQ bacon blue burger. Yum! I'm usually here w/ my 4 year old, and he loves the back area - PLENTY of space to run around. There's usually always a pack of kids out there! And the garden in the back is a nice place to walk off the food. All in all, this place is amazing! Worth the wait, the price, and multiple return visits :)"
0,"Bad experience right out the gate. The parking situation sucks. Valet or nothing. It's not like this is a prestigious upscale neighborhood. Well, I'm not going to walk a few blocks with my 6 month pregnant wife. Valet is great - when it's a choice.  Your parking lot has plenty of spots. Let us park our own car. Would've liked to try the interesting menu, unfortunately I probably never will.  Unless I ride the light rail there."
0,"For drinks and snacks while watching a game ok. For a real meal, find any of the 1000 other places on the strip to try. \n\nService was slow and lackluster. Knowledge of the menu was way below par for a restaurant with this claimed pedigree.  Bottom line, trying to do upscale British food is a lose, lose.  Shepard's Pie was bland and about half way though butcher paper was found nestled in  with the plain mash potatoes which topped this wreck.  \n\n\nStick to beer and fish sticks. You would be better off with that.   They really don't do much well for the price."
1,"Best haircut that I had in a very long time! Wanting something completely new, I decided to have my below the shoulder length hair cut short, very short as in above the ears short. On a whim, I called and made an appt for the same afternoon. The stylist, Janae, saw me right on time. She was extremely friendly and very vivacious. When I showed her a picture of what I wanted, she was surprised and made sure that I truly wanted to make such a drastic change. She did such a fantastic job! I love my new look as does everyone else. I will be going back to Janae for sure and am happily recommending her to everyone I know. Oh, and the prices at Arizona Hair Co cannot be beat. \""Chain\"" salons tend to get a bad rap, but I do know that a stylist in an exclusive salon charging 3 times the price could not have done a better job!!"
0,"I don't even want to give one star. Worst dining experience ever. EVER!! Got there at 700 p.m. ordered 2 waters, and an iced tea. Then the wait began....the waitress. ..rude and overworked...took our orders. There were only 3 of us. At 8:10 we were still sitting waiting for our burgers n fries. The waitresses were not anywhere to be found. I kept asking how much longer and she kept saying...I dont know..like...can you ask the cooks??? People were walking out left and right. The waitresses were meeting people at the door talking people out of staying. They told them to come back early afternoon when it is slower. What are we supposed to do for dinner tonight? They ran out of bacon, shoestring fries, pastrami, diet coke. Finally...we just left. I heard the waitresses apologizing to people with to go orders the whole time we sat there too. Never ever ever would I go here again. We were there for over an hour and in that time...only 1 table got their food. Get it together!  It is quite a drive in the middle of nowhere so I was hoping it would be a hidden gem. NOPE!!! This place has a lot to learn about running a restaurant and customer service. Save your gas!"
1,"My grandmother lives in Washington, PA. Several times a year, I go to visit her and we make the trek to Sesame Inn. I absolutely love their lettuce wraps, Pad Thai, and/or Singapore Noodles.

1,"i'm a bad yelper when it comes to days and time. I was suppose to yelp this place last year in August. LOL.\n\nMy boyfriend went to this place w/ his friends. He called me up and was saying how i should really try this place when we both go to Vegas. I was like okay. \n\nSo i decide to go to Vegas in August, of last year, we made reservations here around lunch time. The place was big and nice. Although it didn't have much people, i still like the atmosphere. \n\nI didn't know what to order because everything looks so yummy and i just wanted to order everything. Sushi is my favorite food. I'll eat anything or try something new if i never had it. So anyways, my bf was telling me that he had the waiter choose his food. I was like really wow, thats nice. So we let the waiter pick our foods. of course, he asked us what type of dishes do we normal like. We told him our preference and he did all the ordering. \n\nMan, can i tell you everything was really good. I can't even remember the dishes he picked. Thats how dam good it was. Hhahaha. Well besides it was last year. LOL. I am going to Vegas this summer. I can't wait to go to this place. I'm drowling. J/k......."
1,"Cheskie's is a Jewish bakery, not a typical Montreal patisserie/bakery. I must admit that I don't have much of a point of reference as I don't typically frequent Jewish bakeries. Furthermore I only purchase one item a Cheskie's and I don't even know what it's real name is. I call it the 'Chocolate Bomb'. They sit in a big tray on the back counter and I think that there is a second flavour, caramel or cinnamon or some such thing. I did try that once and it is not as good as the chocolate. \n\nYes there are many other items at Checkie's that look very tasty and each time I head over there I think to my self 'I'll give something new a try today'. Then I see my 'Chocolate Bomb' and I can't take my eyes off of it. I start thinking about how wonderfully packed full of chocolate it is and how the dough is so sweet and moist and how every bite will just melt in your mouth. Before I know it, I've ordered the 'Chocolate Bomb' and again not given something else a try."
1,"Dr. Bassewitz +++++   My wife and I both had Dr. Bassewitz for our lower back surgeries, a couple of years apart, and are both thrilled with the results. We are also very pleased with the bedside manor of Dr. Bassewitz, he takes his time with you, answers all your questions, explains everything in detail, walks you through what will be involved in the surgery, and all the time does it with a wealth of knowledge and throws in a sense of humor on top of everything else.  Highly, Highly recommended.  Jeff & Pam"
1,Lori does an excellent job with Brazilian waxes.  She's quick and tries to make it as painless as possible.  Her facials are very relaxing. Try the diamond microdermabrasion.  It does wonders!!!  After try one of her relaxing facials.  They make your skin tingle. Lori is very professional and always willing to fit me in.  I definitely recommend her.
0,"Slow service...mediocre pizza and the worst wings EVER!  We ordered for an office lunch, and were very disappointed.  Phoned in complaint and the 12 year old who answered phone,  placed us on hold three times.  They argued with us about the quality of the food.  No more for us."
1,I Love the Staff :) they're so Sweet!!!.. The Food is Great!!!... I Love the Hanan Chicken (lunch Special) the sauce is Delicious!!..
1,"For our normal Sunday lunch - we wanted to try something different. So, off to Yelp to find a place - this place.\n\nThe ambiance of the place is awesome... from the outside - you would never know that this cool place is tucked inside. \n\nThe food was good. We started off with Apples And Bacon Flammenkuchen for the 4 of us. I could have eaten a few of these for lunch - loved the flavor (anything with bacon!). The kids had \""kids pizzas\"" - which are cheese crepes with pepperoni - not their favorite, but they made do. Did I mention that they have sweet potato fries - my favorite!\n\nThen came the REAL reason to come to a place like this... DESERT! We all shared 2 desert crepes and the chocolate fondue dip. Man was it a hit. Kiddos loved being able to dip strawberries and apples into the nicely melted and warm chocolate. The crepes were awesome...caramel with chocolate... YUMMY!\n\nGonna come back - even if just for desert."
1,"Holy Hell, is that a menu or a novel, no matter how many times I go to the cheesecake factory every time they set down the bible of all menus on my table I start feeling like I should have shown up earlier to study my choices and then I end up ordering the same thing anyways. The overall feel of this place is great, yes it is a chain and yes they all look the same but one difference with this place in comparison to other chains is that they are always spot on with the food. \n\nThe other thing about this place is that it is obviously named due to it's insane cheesecake options but i never have room for cheesecake when we are done eating here due to the amount of food you are given when you order a normal size meal. \n\nOn this specific trip the food was fast, delicious and more than enough, i think for the time being this is our location of choice if we are going to be hitting the cheesecake factory."
1,"I really wish Yelp had half stars.  I go 3.5* for NoCa.\n\nI would have given this place 4.5* the first time I went, which oddly enough, was during restaurant week when you'd think it would be the worst in terms of food and service.  But, I went back the other weekend, and it knocked itself down to 3.5*.  Let's hope that when I get back there (and I will give it another chance), it's not down to 3*.\n\nI went on a Sunday Simple Supper night, which for those of you not in the know, is something they do on Sundays where there is a set menu of appetizer, entree and dessert with a couple of options on the entree.  I have no problem with that- as long as they have an option that doesn't fly, swim, or walk, OK by me.  \n\nDinner started off with a croque monsieur with a salad, and they were able to make mine a croque grilled cheese and keep the meaty bits out of my salad.  OK- nothing to knock my socks off.  The others with me felt the same about their meaty versions.  Then, the wait commenced.  We waited, and waited, and waited for the entree.  To the point where it was that elephant in the room that nobody talked about, that I had brought people here talking about how good it was, and here we were sitting for like 45 minutes in between courses.  \n\nWhen it came, we were all nice and hungry, so everyone ate theirs, but nobody was effusing about the deliciousness.  In fact, nobody mentioned it at all.  Mine was also ice cold when in came.  The dessert was also nothing special- some sort of coffee flavored ice cream with some shortcakes which sounded better on paper than they tasted in my mouth- and I love ice cream.\n\nFinally, when I saw our companions of the night again a couple of weeks later, I asked them what they thought of NoCa.  The response was \""eh...it was good...\"" with a shrug of the shoulders.  I'm in total agreement."
0,"It's a really sad thing when the final meal of an outstanding vacation is a lousy one. We had spent a week in San Francisco, foodie nirvana, dining on Indonesian, Basque and Moroccan cuisines. On the last leg of our journey we reached Phoenix at about 1PM. We were tired, hungry, and hadn't been able to find the restaurant we were planning on going to, so as a default we ended up at Thee Pitts Again, a BBQ joint on Bell Road at about 57th Ave. \n\n     When Thee Pitts Again had first opened it had been pretty good, with a few out-of-the-ordinary entrees, like smoked turkey, available. Over the years, I felt it had gone down hill. This visit more than confirmed my opinion. The place was almost empty. We sat on the side usually reserved for groups (tables and chairs as opposed to booths). It felt like a nursing home dining room, trying to be kindergarten cheerful. I became more depressed by the minute. \n\n     We decided to share a slab of ribs - ordering potato salad and fresh fruit as our sides. Our dishes arrived almost instantly, really not a good sign. Especially since it looked like nursing home food. The ribs were on one plate, with pools of orange fat and a lone piece of decorative kale. They had a slightly off smell, but the taste was even worse. Either they had been reheated on a dirty grill, or they had spent a lot of time absorbing odors in the refrigerator (or both). YUCK. The potato salad had turned grey with age and was inedible. It matched my mood. The corn bread was served with margarine... What more can I say?\n\n     A few years ago Thee Pitts Again had made it onto the Food Network show Diners, Drive Ins & Dives. The chef/owner had won many prizes at BBQ cook-offs. Too bad there was no competitive spirit in the restaurant. It sure was a loser."
0,"Went here last night with the family and got dinner to go. Wife got a #7 Carne Asada combo and I got the #4 shredded beef tacos. While we were eating, wife found a plastic disk in her beans, and an old, nasty french fry in her guacamole. There was not a piece of meat that wasn't gristle, so we threw most of hers away. Mine, on the other hand was just bland and tasteless, or so I thought. I spent the night wanting to throw it all back up as it sat like a festering rock in the pit of my stomach. Do yourself a favor, go to the Chipotle down the road; it may not be \""authentic\"" but at least it is edible."
1,"What a great little spot. I came in here for my birthday with a girlfriend last week and it is so cute! We were a little confused at first because the seating isn't traditional (at least that's what we gathered) you just walk in and pick a spot. \n\nOur server was so sweet. I dont remember her name but she was great. We ordered the meatballs which we were super excited to try and after we ordered them she came over and let us know they were sold out. We were a little disappointed but she already had a second recommendation for us which I appreciated. We got the wings instead and they were delicious! The sauce was so sweet and tangy. I loved them.\n\nI ordered the chicken vindaloo pasty and my friend ordered the bangers and mash. Both were super good! They are basically just glorified hot pockets and I don't have any problem with that! \n\nI didnt order a drink but I did notice that they had a great beer selection. \n\nGreat food, great service and priced fairly. I'll be back!"
0,So.. I will say that I had to call several times to get someone to answer the phone so that I can place an order for pick up... The guy who took my order was friendly and polite even read my order back to make sure it was correct... not bad.... I went 25 mins later to pick up my order and was very happily greeted and the got my order with a smile and it was nice.... Went home feeling satisfied with the service... if it was based on service alone i'd give it a 3 1/2 stars... \n\nbut theres more....\n I ate my food... not the best thai food I have ever eaten but it was ok... ugh I start eating more... and what do I find???\n A FREAKING COCKROACH IN MY SOUP.... WTF?!?!  YUCK!!!\n No I didn't mistake it for some kind of herb... ITS A FREAKING ROACH! I'm sick to my stomach... I attempt to call them and guess what NO ANSWER! I'm sorry but I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE AGAIN!!! It's obvious that their kitchen has sanitary problems... I'M DISGUSTED!!! Please be cautious on making the decision to eat here.... The service is great... but I will not order from here again.... make sure you check your food before you take a bite....
1,"This is my second time coming to Q Bistro and Damon took great care of us. He was constantly checking up on us and it made the visit a lot better. We ordered my favorite the spicy rice cakes, kimbap, the chicken wings and a bunch of other entries that were super delicious. Not only was the service and food great but the atmosphere of the restaurant nice as well. Last but not least the  restrooms are beautiful!!! When the restrooms are clean and pretty you know the place's a keeper."
0,"This hotel is gross. There is a sign in the lobby that states they have a 94 sanitation rating, but my husband and I would never have believed that. The hotel looked run down, unkempt, dirty, and like the kind of place that could be reserved by the hour. We were on the first floor and had to walk by the laundry room to get to our room. The door to the laundry room was always open and unpleasant smells were wafting all over. There were  multiple stains in the carpet and the door across the hall from us looked like it had been kicked in - there were paint shards all over the floor from where it had obviously been kicked off the door. The lobby was very unkempt, with chunks of wall and ceiling missing and an overall dirty feeling. It also took a ridiculously long time to check in and out.\n\nThe room felt dirty, there were cigarette burns in the nightstands of our nonsmoking room, there was no comforter on the bed, and I was afraid of what I'd find on the sheets if I looked closely. There was no remote when we got there and after requesting one, it still didn't work. We had to have a maintenance guy come to our room. The bathroom looked clean enough, but we didn't spend a lot of time in there. Husband went to find an ice machine, the sole of which is located on the 3rd floor, and was so sketched out by the elevator that he took the stairs down, which were no better. He said he felt as though he'd turn come down a flight and find someone peeing in the corner.\n\nThere were lots of loud noises while we were there: banging, yelling, door slamming, etc. \n\nWe were planning to partake in the free continental breakfast, but after experiencing the overall \""ickiness\"" of the hotel, we decided to pass. As we were checking out, another guest came to the front desk to inform the staff that the orange juice was coming out as water. We ate breakfast at Mattie's Diner instead and it it was delicious. I will never stay at a Baymont hotel again."
1,"Makes me wish it was socially acceptable to get Lego at my age.\n\nThis place is like heroin for kids, they go apeshit as soon as they walk through the door.  The staff look genuinely happy to be there and I've caught them playing with the toys themselves a few times.\n\nThe best part about this particular store is the electronics isle, where a collective of young Dad's and their wallets try to stay away from the kids."
1,"I mean really how can you beat a movie theater with extremely cheap tickets??  Yeah it's not the newest or the nicest, or even the cleanest (bathrooms are yuck).  But when you don't spend a small fortune on a movie and some snacks and you can have an enjoyable evening out with a good movie, I'd say its a win all around!"
0,"Sandwiches at Jimmy's place.\n\nWith a nice hangover And a belly that needed to be reload of normal food, we headed over to Jimmy johns for some much needed sustenance.\n\nNow I've been to JJ before and I've had a few great experiences but this time I was a little disappointed. Ordering the Beach club sandwich I found the bread to be dry, a little unusual but meh I plowed on, getting through the sandwich I really found it to be really bland and not to the JJ standards that I had experienced before. \n\nMaybe it was a off day for JJ and myself but I will try them again but I won't go out of my way when you got quite a few good places in such close proximity!!!!"
1,"We all but live across the street from this den of iniquities.  I am such a regular that if they don't see me for a week, they notice.  TERRIBLE!\n\nI've been to a few of the local ice cream shops.  The Pink Spot, Mary Coyle, Nami, Sweet Republic.  I am not counting the froyo joints, that is NOT ice cream.  Anyways, they are all great and have their own unique textures, flavors and spins.  However, Churn is the hands-down winner for pure, creamy, insane ice cream goodness.  Pricing is not bad either, with the Ice Cream Sandwich being the best deal.\n\nHubby adores when the rotating special is PB&J.  My signature cup includes two scoops of vanilla atop a red velvet cookie with salted caramel atop.  *swoons*\n\nI love my neighborhood. :)"
0,"I know all fast food workers don't use gloves, but this confuses me. I was sitting in the drive thru (my daughter wanted a shake I hate this location) and I'm watching a young man peel a banana with his hands the break it into pieces with his hands, put it into a cup, the wipe his hands off onto his black apron. Kinda gross. Is his apron clean??"
1,"My family has been attending or performing in shows at the Tuscany Theatre in conjunction with AYT since January 2014.  We have been cast in two, helped backstage with one and simply attended another.  Throughout, the experience has been very fulfilling not only for my daughter but also for myself and the rest of my family.  AYT does a wonderful job truly making you feel like family.  I can't see any reason why my family would go anywhere else.  If you are looking for somewhere for a show or for your child to get involved, look no further.  This is where you want to be!"
1,"One of the best Indian restaurants in town. \n\nThe dosas are great, the tandoori chicken is fabulous, the butter chicken is awesome and the naan is delicious. Enough said!\n\nAnd they deliver; which none of the other indian restaurants do."
1,"I've finally visited this place twice now after taste-testing a sample of their food many months ago. I'm not vegan/vegetarian, but this is still a great place to eat. It's a place that I will definitely visit again.\n\nThe buffalo wings are a must-have item. The spicy buffalo sauce incorporates fresh garlic and scallions and is better than I've had anywhere else. I get this appetizer every time I go. The Thyme fries are also a nice appetizer. The fries are thinly sliced, nicely spiced, and not greasy.\n\nThe dishes are quite large. I have tried the curry and kung pao entrees. Both had nice flavors, but could use more sauce and neither blew me away. The mock meats used in their dishes are very impressive, especially in terms of texture. The appetizers, for me, are large enough to be a meal. Meanwhile, the entree bowls are big enough for two people. \n\nThere is a nice collection of house drinks, including lime, lemon, vimto (red fruit drink), and green tea. You can mix and match them as you like and refills are free.\n\nFor desert, there is a collection of tsoynamis, which are a soy-based ice cream in DQ Blizzard style. I tried the betterfinger version, which was good, but extremely sweet (like eating cake frosting). \n\nThe order line gets backed up to the door, even during off-peak hours. By the way, you order at the counter here, get your own drinks and such, then pick a place to sit. The staff only deliver your food and you clean up after yourself when done. So, this is not a traditional, sit-down restaurant. The environment is very rustic/wooden and laid back. The prices are fair. The staff is very friendly."
1,"can't wait to go back - great food and friendly service.  it is also fun to watch the planes take off, but will go back for the great food at a reasonable price."
1,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a huge craft beer person, I prefer wine and cider. However, I broke with tradition when I came here and ordered a beer and tried a few others. They have an incredible selection, and the bartender (a.k.a. \""the mustache guy\"") is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I started with a french farmhouse style beer from Lavery Brewing Company in Erie, and it was delicious. I then of course reverted to my usual cider and had the bone dry from Arsenal, which is my absolute favorite cider. Ever. \n\nIt's quaint inside, and when you walk in, the bar is the first thing you see on your left. As you keep walking, the place to order sandwiches is on the left, and then there is a large selection of bottled beers to take home on the right. You can make your own six pack, and there is a really good selection (this coming from the not a huge beer person-but don't worry, others have confirmed this).\n\nI sat at the bar with friends and we ended up ordering sandwiches as well. I had the cheesy beefy, and I would certainly go back just for the sandwich! Perfectly beefy. Perfectly cheesy. Enough veggies on the sandwich to keep me from feeling too guilty.\n\nMy friends and I met the owner, who was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about craft beers. I look forward to coming back with friends, especially because it didn't have any of the \""seedy South-side feel\"" that I desperately try to avoid.\n\nTry this place for delicious beer and sandwiches!"
1,"At the end of this review, I will share a tip on how to save 50% off your entrees.\n\nThe night before I was booked for The Range, I had the most horrible experience for dinner at another steakhouse so I was hoping (maybe praying) for a better experience.\n\nLocated on the third floor in Harrah's, you first approch an exclusive double elevator in the Casino where a hostess confirms your reservation and summons an elevator for you.\n\nWhen you step off into the foyer, you can see that Harrah's has spared no expense to make sure the cutomer knows they are in a fine dining restaurant.  Beautiful woods and tile throughout and floor to cieling windows surround this restaurant which is in a half-circle overlooking the Strip.\n\nBehind the glass elevators is a lounge with a piano player.  At the second hostess station, I was greeted by name and escorted to my table which was windowside.\n\nI sat down, and seconds later my waiter introduced homself (Chas, prnounced Chaz), gave me the menu and specials, and took my drink order.  A bread basket was immediately delivered with butter in a cup which had been piped through a pastry bag unlike the night before where I recieved butter in gold foil in the other fine dining place.\n\nI ordered French Onion soup ($8), a Caesar Salad ($8), and a NY Strip Bone-In ($42) for my entree.\n\nThe soup was delivered hot and served in a huge cored-out onion.  I thought the soup was absoltely delicious and was actually a Cream of French Onion which was quite unique, but I thought the portion could have been bigger.\n\nThe Caesar Salad dressing was absolutely one of the best I have ever had and anchovies were delivered on the salad as ordered.\n\nThe steak was absolutely cooked perfect and was butter soft.\n\nHaving had three perfect courses with such great service, I decided to try one of their desserts.  I am not a sweets person, but I had 3 choices from 12 on the menu.  I chose the Tiramisu, Cheescake, and Creme Brulee.  I asked the waiter of my 3 choices, which he recommended.  He suggested the Creme Brulee which was my first choice, but it was served as a trio--Raspberry, Chocolate, and Vanilla.  I asked if I could just get the vanilla and was told that many customers had that request, and the chef prepares larger portions of just vanilla, although that option was not on the menu, but available.\n\nFrom that point on, I have to say that the Creme Brulee was THE BEST I have ever tasted from Paris, New Orleans, Montreal or anywhere!\n\nThe meal, restaurant, and service were so impeccable, that I did something I have never done in 25 years of travelling---I repeated the restaurant a second time the next night with a different menu!\n\nNow for the good news.  If you stop at any of the 11 Tix4Tonight locations in Las Vegas, you can buy a coupon for 50% off an Entree for The Range for $3.00.  So for 2, you spend $6.00 up front for a savings of about $45 for a couple.  Be sure to make reservations in advance--even on a weeknight, and be sure to ask for a window table."
1,"They have really good Filipino food.\n\nLike most Filipino restaurants, it's all about the food.  Don't expect any scenery.\n\nI come here for a desert called \""halo halo\"".  Order one, mix it up, and enjoy it on a hot summer day."
1,"I love this place! The customer service is fantastic, they memorized our names and orders after only our second time there. The coffee is great and they always make sure that you like what you ordered. \n\nIf you like chai tea lattes, try it with the French vanilla syrup! It's delicious!"
0,"In general, I like Einstein Bros Bagels. Not the best food in the world, certainly not the worst. This location has been a quick breakfast stop for the wife and I since we moved to this part of town. I haven't had any problems with the quality of food at this location, but literally every time I go into this store, the same people are working, and they are always grumpy. It doesn't matter if its busy or slow, they are grumpy and running around like they have their heads cut off. \nLike I said, I've not had a problem with the food, but the service isn't up to snuff because of the attitudes of the staff. I can't say I won't come back, because I know I will, some days start better with a Spicy Elmo and a cup of their Fair Trade coffee...but if I can find another quick breakfast spot in the area, I will be a happy man."
0,"This place sucks. I made a yelp account as I wait for my food at this place. I put my order for spicy and they gave me original because they \""ran out\"" of spicy. She said it would be 11 minutes wait for it. Which I am. And I am looking at the rest of my order sit there on the counter. I told her I wanted everything warm and she simply put it back with the rest of the other chicken. Wow. We shall see how it comes out. Damn my craving for fried chicken."
1,I have been to a couple of the other Classic Car Spas and this location is by far the best. They do a great job and are very friendly.  My car is always immaculate. Chris was very helpful and didn't try to upsale me things I didn't need. I'll drive a few extra miles to come back here.
0,"While my son had an enjoyable time at the class he attended, I have had a less then enjoyable time interacting with Chef Kathy about signing up for additional classes.\n\nThe website is difficult to navigate, the monthly class schedule is hard to locate on the site and even harder to actually decipher and Chef Kathy is hasty & unprofessional in replies to email inquires asking for clarification.\n\nA recent string of emails left a bad taste in my mouth and I blogged in detail about the experience on my personal blog.   I feel that Chef Kathy took her frustration with me (after pointing out a typo on the calendar that caused a large misunderstanding about which class was available and when) out on my children by not enrolling them in the class I requested. \n\nI emailed requesting spots at 8:40am on Dec 8th after being told via email at 830pm on Dec 7th that there was space available in the Dec 23rd class I was inquiring about  Chef Kathy proceeded to wait 11 days before replying to my request- in which she then informed me that she had sold the class out and could not accommodate my kids.\n\nIf passes for classes had not already been pre-purchased I would never deal with this woman or this business again. But since the passes were a gift from my children's grandmother I feel obligated to use them."
0,"We had been regulars, but in the past 18 months or so we've seen service & food decline in quality.   There were occasions where we were told they \""ran out of clean chilled glasses\"" - \""...we're out of clean forks...sorry\"" WHAT!!!   Then there's the food, we've also had occasions where we can't order something from the menu because they ran out if this or that.  The servers have ALWAYS been wonderful though.  I have spoken to two different managers in the past, suggesting better kitchen management   I truly hope they make improvements because we really enjoy dropping in but at this point we'll be looking elsewhere for a local pub/grill....Chicago Pub/Pizza on Ocotillo & Ganzel is nice, a little further from our home but good bet, food & service."

1,The chicken caesar sandwich was very good! This is about as tasty as a gyros place can be.
1,Great food and super friendly bartenders/servers.   Definitely will go back.
1,"Food was good but can I tell you that the service was absolutely impeccable. The waiter was attentive to every detail.\nWe never had to wonder where he was or left wanting. When he served the plates he took caution to notify us of which side he was placing the plates, he explained the specials, he was \""present\"". \nGreat Job!"
1,"I must start by saying I am a sushi FANatic. I absolutely love sushi! With all of that being said, I will say that this buffet is a sushi lovers dream, they have everything, even combinations you cant even imagine. Every time we are in Vegas we make it a point to eat here."
0,"The three hour tour. I vow to never shop at this store ever again as there customer service is on par with the Department of Motor Vehicles. \n\nLast Sunday I called to verify the price of an item, a iPod Touch 8GB, and to also verify that it had a $50 gift card. Specifically asked if it was a gift card or a Fry's card and the girl told me it was a Fry's Card. So I spent an hour loading up my cart with items to pay and pick up at the store.  Shopping cart won't work - I keep getting an error. Call the store and explain and the gal does it on her computer so I recite the 10 items and item numbers. She says \""Oh I got an error.\"" Yea...well just like me. She does it again from the beginning...error again. Goes to get a supervisor and we go through the whole dog and pony show again...twice. Same result error. They tell me that they will go and get all of the items together and put them on will call and I can come pay at the store. They will call me when ready. No one ever calls. \n\nI call the next morning to see what happened. Talked to the specific super from the day before, says sorry about the call, but yes all items are on will call. I ask if at same price and deals and am told yes. \n\nDrive my happy a$$ all the way across town and guess what...yea, nothing on will call. Wait 20 minutes and the box comes up. Agent tells me that not all items are on the same price. Ugghh..specifically asked that in my call. Goes to talk to someone and 10 minutes later comes back and says no. Fine leave that item out. Rings it up and I ask about the gift card...yea you guessed it \""What gift card.\"" Same fire drill and I explain it all again in detail to him and gave the guys name I talked to on the phone. 10 more minutes a supervisor comes over and asks. Have to repeat the same story AGAIN. \n\nGrowing impatient as this deal is narrowing on 2 3/4 hours in total plus a 25 minute drive here and back. 15 more minutes of waiting and I tell the Agent, \""Dude this is just taking too long. Just take out the iPod Touch and I'll pay for the rest and go. Guy gets nervous and says ok just a minute AND LEAVES. \n\nA \""manager\"" came over a few minutes later. This is when it goes over the top. This stocky bald headed white guy approaches me and get this...he puffs up and says to me \""Is there a problem here?\"" Are you friggin' kidding me! Well yea, with your arrogant and aggressive puff up and comment, well yea there was an issue and now it is a problem. This from a \""Manager\"" no less. I geared for a comment, but then bit my lip and just said, \""You know what, this process has been far too painful and I just want to go now, so take the item off so I can leave.\"" This arrogant tool, gives me the passive-aggressive mean spirited \""Just trying to help\"" line before turning away. His arrogance was almost like he was happy he won this apparent battle in his mind's eye. Ridiculous! Yea you won...you won me spending my $400.00 using Amazon Prime\"" you idiot. \n\nOne last SNAFU for me was when the supervisor comes back and hands me a VOID receipt...yea you guessed it again, he voided the entire order and not just the iPod Touch taken off as I requested (all in front of the \""Manager\"" too I might add). Walked out completely empty handed and drove home.  \n\nThe three hour tour. I vow to never shop at this store ever again as there customer service is on par with the Department of Motor Vehicles."
0,"Food:\n-Ham/brie/tomato was just okay, I mean, it's exactly how it sounds, good salad on the side\n-Sweet potato fries were not made in house and were pretty much burnt\n-Crawfish mac and cheese was bland, texture of the macaroni was too mushy, only positive (depending on who you ask) was that it was a huge ass portion\n\nService, omg so fail:\n-One waitress running the small restaurant, didn't seem to know the menu at all, had no idea what gluten free meant, unable to give any recommendations, brought my friend and I both the wrong things, wtf\n\nAside from the small diversity my friend and I brought to the restaurant, the place was strangely filled with all old white women. Did we eat at a retirement community instead? That'd explain the (lack of) service and food quality."
0,4th time in a row that they screwed up the order. Waited 20 min for them to figure it out and get our food!
1,"This is about as good as it gets in Vegas.  It's definitely more upscale for a BBQ joint.  The BBQ here is really good but a little pricey.  The good thing is the portions are ENORMOUS.  \n\nWe shared a 3 meat combo (St Louis Ribs, Chicken, and swapped Tri-Tip for Brisket).  It came with 2 sides for 27.99.  \n\nEverything was great.  The chicken was so moist, brisket not dry, and the ribs were very tasty.  We really enjoyed the biscuits with apple butter - be sure to ask for more.\n\nI am a BBQ snob so if anyone knows of a better place (not named Buzz), please message me.  \n\nTill then i'll keep coming back here :8"
1,"Much improved over last years stay. We had a premium king room and what a bargain. Still avoided TGIF restaurant though and enjoyed the Noodle Express and Port o' Call Buffet. Did alright on the slots and made up the rest with the Jets win over the Patriots. Go Jets!\n\nMike from the staff also opened up the showroom this year (unlike last year) so we could watch the big screen televisions for the Sunday Playoff games. Thank you, it was great to watch the games on the big screen and not having to go to another casino to see it.\n\nThe hotel staff did great job keeping all the areas clean and our room was always cleaned early since we placed the maid service placard on the door when we left the room first thing in the a.m. \n\nLastly, the shuttle to the corner of Flamingo and Las Vegas Blvd was very convenient. I don't think I had to wait more than 10 minutes for each trip. Well worth the add-on charge when you initially sign in."
0,"Terrible service, here, my son is no longer a patient here, the service is terrible, the only good thing I can say is the  male receptionist is nice, but for as the doctor and her assistance 4 thumbs down.  The office gave me and my husband the biggest run around. My son were getting some test done, results came in but they could not determine the results, then they sent us to a lab, got results back again, they could not read them, then for the 3rd time they ask us to come back.  What made it worst is that they would not communicate with us on the phone they needed us to come in to the office. So far my husband missed 2 days of work, and additional they wanted us come in again twice, basically 4 days missed from work because of they bull crap! They will never see us again."
1,"BEST STARBUCKS IN THE VALLEY!  Honestly, I pass up two other Starbucks on the way to work to go to this one.  The people are so friendly and nice they make my mornings!  Customer service A+!  Always yummy too!"
1,"I ordered the Mango Curry and when I ate it, I actually died and went to heaven where I promptly ordered it again. Also, the veggie spring rolls taste like the most amazingly beautiful shade of green. Perfect!"
1,"This place rocks!  Nida and Boo are both EXCELLENT technicians and quick.  The salon is very nice, clean,  modern although some nice spa music would be a nice touch.  They offer deals to help make lashes more affordable and keep clients coming back. I am hooked on the pure mink lashes.  I dont get Lady Gaga lashes; I just get a mix of 8 and 10 lengths (I think) and I love them.  Really make my eyes pop! So addictive!"
0,"Overpriced!\n\nThey don't clean your clothes any better than any other cleaners, but you pay for the convenience of the drive-up service.\n\nUnless there's some reason that you can't get out of your car, I'd advise driving past this place and taking the time to walk in somewhere else."
0,Dark...kind of creepy\n\nI am not sure what thy want to be...a bar? restaurant? creep museum? \n\nThe food was very bland....sounds so good when you read it. Not so much when it is in your mouth. \n\nSo many other choices downtown.
0,"I am an avid reader and spend quite a bit of money weekly at Barnes and Noble, both online and at the local store. This evening, I escorted my mother to this store so that she could buy a book for my niece, and while there I found a book myself. My mother is disabled, and I went to checkout for her. I was buying two books, separately, with two different payment methods (one mine, one my mothers). My mother was waiting near by and it was obvious that we were together. When I went to check out, I told the salesperson that I was checking these items out separately, and that we both had a coupon. The coupons both had the same code number (which as I verified with another salesperson after the fact, every copy of this coupon has the same number). This salesperson, Steven, refused to check me out. He told me that it didn't matter that I was checking out for two separate people, using separate pay methods, or that we each had coupons sent to directly to us. He said that the code could only be used one time, and would only let me purchase one item. He was incredibly rude in the way that he spoke to me, and I will not go back to this store for this very reason. This is the only store that is convenient to my location, which means that my money will now be spent at an independent seller instead of at your store. As I walked away, and went to find someone else to help me complete my purchase, he called the manager (in front of my mother) and told him that I was coming to complain about him and that I was angry because he wouldn't let me check out multiple items using the same coupon, that was not the scenario as he well knew, and the manager (only a few feet away and also within ear shot of my mother) then stated that he would back him up should I complain; which effectively negated my ability to resolve this issue in store. If this is how customers are allowed to be treated, then I will not be going back. I have been treated rudely by salespeople before, but never as blatantly as by Steven at the Tempe, AZ Tempe Marketplace store."

0,"I always give places a second chance when I have a not-so-great experience the first time. I figure, hey, everyone has an off day, and the establishment is kind of new, so I should cut them a break.\n\nThe second time here assured me I will not be returning. The service here is really bad. We had the same waitress both times who just doesn't seem to care. I had been in the food service for years awhile back, so I know this is not the way you treat guests.\n\nBoth times I was there, they were out of something that someone ordered. It took a long time for the waitress to get us waters, and even longer to get drinks. The place was not very busy, yet it seemed to take forever for us to get second drinks. We asked for 3 separate checks (1 for me, 1 for another friend, and 1 for my friend and her husband) and the waitress came back with everything on one bill. When we asked her to separate it (again, we were very clear) she gave us 4 separate checks, putting my friend and her husband on different bills. When we asked her to change it, she acted like it was no big deal that she did it wrong in the first place.\n\nThe food here is okay, but the place doesn't look or feel like a British pub. With some other wonderful pubs in town with great service, great food, and great atmosphere, this one just isn't worth it."
1,"The broth is so tasty , big portion, fast service and friendly staff. \nBubble tea is good for summer. Worth it to give it a try."
1,"I loved this place. I loved the fact that there are glammed out cocktail waitresses taking drink orders at 9AM on Sundays. I loved the pink and purple neon and the half moon booths.  I loved the biscuts and gravy, and my three scrambled eggs... extra cheese.  For the health concious, my friend ordered a yogurt and fruit nut thing that looked like it might be good for you. \n\nIf you are in Vegas you have to check this place out."
0,"I've stayed at a lot of places on the Strip & was surprised how sub-par the Luxor is.  It's priced in the medium/high range, but offers a low/medium tier experience, not to mention it's at the far end of the strip.  \n\n- The AC is so-so.  Make sure to close the blinds on your window otherwise your room will warm up quickly & take a long time to cool off.\n\n- Because the elevators (\""inclinators\"") are slanted to the shape of the hotel, it's more like riding a subway car than a traditional elevator.\n\n- Also, the elevators can make a lot more walking than you expect.  Like a lot of hotels, certain elevators only go to certain floors.  However, unlike a hotel where all the elevators are clustered in a centralized location, Luxor has an elevator bank in each of its four corners.  Your particular elevator will only be in one of then.  This means you may need to walk to the complete opposite end of the hotel to get to your elevator & once on your floor double back to complete opposite end again.\n\n- The design of the hotel is such that the hallways of the hotel are open to the atrium.  If you're on an upper floor, it can be fairly un-nerving if you don't like heights.  \n\n- There's no wireless Internet.  However, they automatically charge you a \""resort fee\"" which includes a wired one in your room.\n\n- Check-in lines are long, but you can check-out through TV.\n\nMy advice is to stay at the Flamingo.  The rooms are equivalent to slightly better, it's typically a fair bit cheaper, and better located."

0,"We stopped by the Deacon's House for some breakfast (and to get out of the rain).  The two of us went for the standard breakfast which was mediocre.  Its hard to screw up some eggs and bacon and sausage but they gave it a good go!  The eggs were scrambled but seemed like they were sat in a puddle of water!  The food was edible, but only just.  I don't know what it is but it was hard to find a decent breakfast in Edinburgh!\n\nI did however like the coffee and also the cafe itself, which used to be the workshop of the Deacon (who's real name I have forgotten) and the story behind this guy.  Although a respected cabinetmaker, he was also a thief and he and his friend and co-crook were hanged on gallows that the cabinetmaker built!  I'll bet the guy wished he didn't do such a great job on them!"
0,"I have eaten here several times and for the most part, dinning in seems to be a solid 3 stars, maybe 4 if I'm feeling particularly generous. However, I will never be a customer here again, in any fashion. Why? Because of their utter failures in the take out department. 2 flippin times these clowns have ruined our night by butchering our take out order. I would call to express their liability for the screw up and no responseability was ever taken. Were it not for the decent dine in experiences  we have had, this would one star for sure."
0,"The service here is the worst, we had a group of 30 people in the empty restaurant and I asked to move some tables together and they said no that's impossible.  Then after waiting 45 min for our food I got the wrong pizza and went to give it back, the waitress then wanted to give me the half already eaten pizza which was sent to another customer to me.  She then started to argue that she saw nothing wrong with it, we all thought that was gross and crazy.... I cancelled my order because I did not want someone Else's half eaten pizza! ewww!\n\nFrom those who did have the pizza said it was hard and had no taste!"
0,"Let me start of by saying I LOVE food, great service, I like to share the enormous portions served in restaurants, drink water with lemon and I do not drink alcoholic beverages.  I know, I scream cheapskate, but I think I deserve a decent 2.5 star experience, at least for the food.  Most places meet or exceed my expectations.  Guiseppes did not. \n\nAnd there comes a time when my youthful, ethnic appearance, water with lemon, request to share, and sober living is met with that \""I am not going to make money off of you\"" vibe from the owner.  It hasn't happened in a very long time, but Guiseppes proved their still is bad service reserved for their unwanted patrons.\n\nI was very excited to eat here seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives on Food Network, my favorite food network show, and seeing all of the New Times best of awards.  Got there at 8:30pm Friday night, there were people waiting outside, thought it was a good sign.  Now I thought being in a strip mall, next to the water N ice store, the service would be warm and welcoming and the place would be chock full of non-dbags.  I am always cool waiting a bit for good food but being stared down by rich, overweight women with their husbands in flip flops, cargo shorts and Affliction tees and teenage platinum blondes with their smug smiling boyfriends in their flip flops, plaid shorts, and Affliction tees is never my cup of tea.\n\nFast forward 30 minutes of this ish we get seated, another 10 minutes menus, another 10 minutes a water and a watered down gross iced tea which they CHARGED us for even though she took it back and gave him water, and by 9:30pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalty bolognese ragu with overcooked spaghetti (we didn't get the homemade pasta) to share, 4dollar baby 1/2 inch thin toastettes, and 2dollar marinara bowl for dipping.   (FYI this is an Italian Restaurant that not only makes you pay for an ounce of bread, they also CHARGE for extra virgin olive oil)\n\nSo go to Guiseppes if you like:\n\n_\""EH\"" Italian Food\n_Cold and dry humor from the owner\n_Slow waitresses\n_Being stared at by stuffy people in such an unlikely, un-stuffy atmosphere\n_Your hopes let down =) Enjoy!"
0,"I had breakfast here with BF & my niece. The server seemed kind of spacey and weird. The menu had many, many items on it, so it took us awhile to decide.\n\nFinally ordered - Eggs Benedict Florentine for me, Pancakes & sausage for my niece, and a Bagel with Salmon for the BF.\n\nFood came out and it LOOKED great. Then we ate it. BF did like his bagel & salmon, but come on, how can you eff that up?\n\nNiece's pancakes were dry. She said not even syrup could save them. BF tried her cakes and agreed that they were the driest he had ever had. She also said her sausage was bland. \n\nMy Eggs Benedict Florentine was not good. First off, they put swiss cheese on them. Cheese? Hm. One of my eggs was totally undercooked and beyond runny, the other was totally overcooked and the yolk was all dried out. One of my english muffins was stale and I couldn't even cut through it.\n\nThe spinach was good, but that was about it. Oh yeah, the total for this crappy breakfast? $67!!!"
0,"There were 8 of us that ate here during the weekend, 4 ordered the filet mignon, 3 didn't finish their steaks. Too salty and not good quality was the consensus. I ordered the vegan meatballs with polenta (my stomach was hurting and needed something lighter than steak), tasted like real meat but again, way too salty. Sides of mac n cheese and potato gratin, I was told these were also salty. Get the theme here? Or maybe that's how Americans eat - with tons of salt on everything?\n\nThe bread they start you off with are really good though! Especially those bacon bits biscuits. Sloooooooooooooooo service. If you ain't paying the big bucks, you are getting served last, for everything (water, food, bill, etc).\n\nVery nice view of the waterfall area they had. \n\nIt's not my cup o' tea and will not go back."
0,"My latest project was building a storage shed and chicken coop, which entailed numerous visits to our very close by Lowe's. I will go months with nary a hardware need, then when i start a project, i stop by the store nearly everyday because I constantly make construction mistakes. \n\nMy most dozen or so recent visits continue to leave me with a bad taste in my mouth for these giant hardware stores. Sure they're cheaper, but it is so disappointing because their employee assistance with projects is far from the commercials they air. \n\nWhich is why a weekender like me has to go back so many times because no one is ever around to help me find the part I'm looking for. And is why it is a great idea to research your project online prior to going in to Lowe's because basically, you more than likely will be left on your own to figure things out. When constructing the self-feeder for my chickens out of plumbing pipes, i stood there picking up things, trying to fit things together for at least 45 minutes....i walked around looking for an employee for advice....nada. Needless to say, i have had to return about half a dozen items and buy several more pieces. \n\nMost recently, i decided to tile my back patio. Low and behold, there was a flooring guy in the tile area. I told him my project and asked \""Any suggestions on thin-set or grout? Sanded, non-sanded?\"" He didn't answer at first, then I said \""excuse me, can i ask a question about tiling an outdoor patio?\"". He looked at me like i was a complete idiot and in huff says \""What? Well, sanded grout of course! You'll only have to do all the work over if you get non-sanded!\"" and basically ran away as if there were free donuts in the break room. \n\nArghhhh. but....yes....i will have to go back....to return this damn 4\"" pvc elbow joint when i should've gotten a 3\""."
1,Small place. Never knew it was there until I looked it up on Yelp. \nThe sausage gravy is perfect and you can tell it is homemade. The portions were perfect. The staff is friendly and the food came out faster than I expected.
0,"I'm a Carrabba's guy, everywhere I go in the US.  This experience wasn't  the  best, I always order the chicken Marsala this time it didn't look the same (not a lot of sauce and mushrooms as I'm used to and the chicken was very thin) I thought  that all the restaurants would be the same. The service was very good though.  I expected more though.  This experience would not keep me from going back to my local Carrabbas"

I guess they decide when the close because it wasn't 10pm and that's when they say they close on Saturday night....after 22 take out orders from this new location since they opened I guess they will be losing my business now.  Masa....when are you open and closed???  When you decide...put it on your website so people can order food when your open.

1,"All you can drink house wines are really good! The menu is short and simple, but taste's great. The atmosphere is what really makes this place pop, and I love the little old guy with the accordion! It's a local fav, and easy to find. Parking is limited, so walk from the Flamingo."
0,"If their customer service would have been better. I could have stretched a 3 star. But...\nI started with the Vito. The bread was soft but had no taste which in most cases is OK because the taste should come from the meats/cheese/etc.\nBut even with deli meats, my pallet was barely moved. I probably shouldn't have had one so close to a Subway deli trio, cuz I had one the night before.\nI initially introduced myself as a first timer, and I wanted to know about the ordering process. The order-taker kind of expected me to know what I'm doing. But when he got around to explaining I ended up having to view the menu board myself. I should add that the guy folded his arms on top of his register screen and leaned over it as if his job was back-breaking. \nAside from him, one other order taker, two delivery persons, and maybe 4 sandwich makers, I would expect everyone to be on top of their game. But customer service was a department they don't have.\nThe only positive thing I observed is that my sandwich was ready in seconds. But even then, I had to bag it myself with the rest of my over-priced combo."

0,"My husband and I used to eat at this restaurant all the time.  We always loved the food.  However, the last time we were there , the manager disagreed with where we asked to be seated based on the placement of our highchair.  We did not realize that it was a problem.  Afterall, the hostess sat us there.\n\nWhen the manager saw what happened, he aggressively approached our table, rapped his knuckles on the table, and loudly imformed us that \""this was never happening again\"".  You betcha, Buddy, because after being chewed out by this manager like I was a tardy dishwasher, we weren't coming back.  I was angry and embarassed as this manager was loud enough that people at other tables were staring at us, so I emailed the restaurant's corporate offices right there from my phone.\n\nA few days later, I received a phone call from the restaurant's general manager.  I think that her name was Lisa. At first, I thought that Lisa was going to work this out with me, perhaps apologize for her underling's poor behavior. That just wasn't going to happen.  What Lisa gave me was a second butt chewing.  She interrupted me time and again, and even accused me of being a bad mother because the placement of the highchair was dangerous and against city code, that she was more concerned about the safety of my child than I was.  Had she stopped talking over me for 2 seconds, she would have learned that my husband is an architect and has forgotten more about building and city codes than some diner manager would ever know.  What she didn't know that my husband did know was that the placement of the highchair was well within city egress requirements.\n\nShe then claimed to have reviewed the tape of the manager approaching our table and she that the table rapping never happened.  She was lying.  It did happen.  I saw it.  My husband saw it, and my baby jumped when he did it.  She either did not review the tape or there was no tape to review.  I seriously doubt that they have cameras trained on every table in any restaurant, much less a pancake diner.  \n\nDuring this entire conversation, I kept trying to get a word in edgewise to complain about the way the first manager all but yelled at us.  It was awful, and soon as she was done verbally abusing me, she said goodbye and HUNG UP on me.  I was shocked.  She never had any intention of working this out.  Her intention was to bully me for daring to complain about one of her co-workers.  And sadly, we have lost one of our favorite breakfast spots because I will not contribute a nickel to that woman's salary.\n\nI had heard, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, that several restaurants in casinos had recently closed their doors.  If this is how they allow their manager to speak to people, I am not the least bit surprised.  I have since told everyone I know about the abuse that I suffered at this woman's hands and will continue to bad mouth this restaurant every opportunity I get."
0,"Today I ordered a large vanilla cone and paid for it the person at the counter  said \""That'll be right up for you.\"" Well it wasn't right up and I waited for 20 minutes before they finally got around to making it for me. Another time a couple years ago i ordered an ice cream cone and the boy who was working behind the counter made the cone and set it on top the ice cream machine and let it melt. when I asked why my cone was sitting there melting he said very rudely, \"" oh i forgot i made it. here you go.\"" he said and handed me the cone. \""I don't want the melted cone!\"" I said. I was furious and even more so when I had to argue with him that he owed me a new, fresh cone. What an embarassment! C'mon McDonalds, get your stuff together!!"
0,Super smokey inside. The day bartender has real attitude. Not all good. Friendly crowd.
1,"This has definitely become our go-to ice cream place! We love the local feel.  It's neat that they have both couches and regular tables to sit at. The people working there are super friendly and super helpful. Oh, and the ice cream is fantastic. :) My favorite was during the holiday season when they had pumpkin pie ice cream!!! Why, oh why, can't that be a year-round flavor?!\n\nAnyway, did I mention they deliver??? An ice cream place that delivers? Are you serious? I think my life may be complete now! I think we're just outside their delivery range, sadly. But it's still cool!"

0,"The $2.99 skillet breakfast is a greasy nightmare. The hash browns are a solid hunk of mushy, greasy watery potatoes, while bacon needs more oven time and my eggs came out undercooked. You need a player card and to purchase a beverage to get all-night heartburn. Meal was salvaged by last second add on of a short stack of pancakes. Two large cakes were quite good, although syrup packets are a bit outdated. Anything after 9pm and a weird assortment of characters are usually there. Don't make eye contact and you should survive the meal."
0,We were there for lunch and had both below average food and poor service. The waiter actually would like look away as he passed as if he were looking over other tables...there were only five tables occupied and he only had only a couple.
0,"I had dinner at the Wonder Bar with my companion and we wanted to share an entree.  The waitress didn't say anything about sharing when we ordered and I thought she was nice enough to bring us an extra plate.  When the check came, there was a $5 \""plate charge\"".  What an unpleasant surprise... It costs $5 to have an empty plate?   I'm against this type of sneaky underhanded way to generate revenue.   I did not feel like ending my dinner with a complaint to the manager.  But needless to say, I will not return."
1,"I think this place is pretty awesome.  I first came here along with coworkers because it was close to our work location.  Seems to be the go to for when the office is craving Mexican.  This place is clean and actually is pretty busy during lunch time.  \n\nThey first serve you with their chips, salsa, and bean dip...all very simply, amazing!  I think I get carried away with it when I go there because I get full before my meal even arrives.  \n\nI usually like to order any of their burritos.  Its massive.  I first ordered the shrimp burrito because I thought it would be skimpy, boy was I wrong.  Shrimp in every single bite.  I was waay full by the time I got halfway. \n\nYou can sometimes find Groupon deals for this place, so shop smart so you can save yourself some money to attempt to try the whole menu :)"
1,"Only a week since this place opened. The restaurant is decorated tastefully and is spotless. Located in a strip center -  self parking was a breeze to locate.\n\nIt was lunch and I went with the pork Tonkatsu. The entree came with miso soup, salad and steam rice. The portion was generous and my friendly waitress crushed sesame seeds and mixed it with a sauce which was yummy for the pork Tonkatsu. The Tonkatsu was crispy on the outside and moist and hot inside. \n\nI'm so looking forward to returning and trying their curry."
0,"Prices are the most expensive in the area for prime time movies.  Facility cleanliness needs some work, especially in the restrooms."
0,"It was okay. Which I hate saying, because the people who worked there were AWESOME!  They were patient and answered everyone's questions, mainly because flavors are not marked with anything other than flavor of the month or flavor of the week. They have a Pink Velvet donut which is a beautiful neon pink donut that looks intriguing but there is no signage for it so you have ask what it is. Come on this has got to be the SIGNATURE donut which I am going to respectfully suggest they change the name to a Pinkbox Velvet donut. Anyway I got the Fat Elvis. I was disappointed which I am so sad about!! The filling was kind of like a peanut butter banana sauce.  I was expecting it to be more like a peanut butter banana mousse/ cream filling.  I think it would have tasted better.  :( I didn't enjoy it, but a lot of other people do, so I obviously know ZIP about donuts.  \n\nI am going back! Everything looked too promising not to give it another try!\n\n*******\nSecond and LAST visit:\n\nI wanted to give this place another shot to redeem itself.  One person working, NO SIGNS indicating flavors so you have to ask what everything is, which means if you have to, so does everyone else.  This results in friendly but SLOW service.\n\nI got a cookies and cream (it was labeled) and it was dry and by dry I mean a crunchy donut. A crunchy all the way through, boring tasting donut. This is why I took a star away.  \n\nI also got a pumpkin cheesecake donut.  Two bites in the filling came out of the bottom and landed on my clothes. Not a pretty look.  Luckily, I can go home and change.  This was the messiest donut I have ever eaten. It would have been good if the filling hasn't fallen out.  Is this normal for this place for their donuts to break? This is also why I took a star away and basically refuse to ever go back."
1,"I have no idea why Trio's isn't rated higher but it can't be the food. I have been coming here for 20 years and reviewing someplace poorly because of a bad joke you heard is very ignorant.

I really don't know how you can go wrong, they have great chefs that cook a lot of things from scratch, get the specials they are worth it usually. Apple pear vinaigrette is a winner too."

Bumped from room to room,  promised we were on non smoking floor, but still smoke poured in.  Offered \""spray\"" to cover the smoke smell which would have created even more asthma.  Every time I called front desk they were rude and would say \""what do you expect me to do. \""  I was in tears most nights trying to figure out how to sleep having allergic reactions to smoke and flamingo staff who didn't care they were discriminating against me.  Don't believe them if you need no smoking .  They don't have any.  When we tried to resolve with management, they didn't feel we made a big enough of a stink as we requested being moved to warrant any recognition for how miserable and inconvenient our stay was."
1,"Nice, quiet spot away from busy city centers.\n\nWe've stayed in a Drury before, thus the ability to use points for a King room with jacuzzi.  EXCELLENT!\n\nClean, nice and updated with great breakfasts and kid-friendly \""happy-hour\"" though on this visit we did not partake.\n\nConveniently located to enough amenities like shopping, dining, massage and hiking, but more restful than being in downtown anywhere-else.\n\nStaff was friendly and helpful; day attendant gave us an extra-late check-out perhaps in honor of our anniversary.  Evening attendant suggested a \""massage parlor\"" just up on Happy Valley.  Umm, I think the word you were looking for was massage therapy.\n\nOur room was fine.  Nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable though I would have loved to have the jacuzzi open to the room and a firmer bed.  I did LOVE the jacuzzi and now I understand why they don't put bubble bath, shower get or shampoo anywhere near it (it was in dispensers in the shower).  I used it twice and it filled extremely quickly with as hot of water as I could stand.\n\nThe pool was delightful after a hike in the nearby Deem hills especially with an indoor/outdoor transition.  Did not try the jacuzzi here...why would I?  Private bathing is much preferred.\n\nGreat stay perfect for relaxation!"
1,"Beat Safelite's price by $100 and provided fast, perfect results. Couldn't be happier!"
1,"This was my first experience with reflexology, and for $25 ($10 off Mon-Thurs),I was super pleased.  I skipped the foot soak since I had come over from the nail salon but the massage part lasted for an hour and put me right to sleep.  Comfortable chairs, dark and soothing music.   The massage chairs were a bit too rough for me but that could just be me. Absolutely worth the money."
1,Great Burrito!  On Thursdays they have $5.49 Burritos and it's a steal.  I had the Chipotle shrimp burrito and my wife had the fish and plantain burrito. Both were excellent!  Try the Salsa bar as well!!  The owners were so kind as to bring our 3 year old a free cup of milk and a side of rice and beans (also free). It's service like this that makes customers for life!  We will be back!!
1,"Wassup Annie and Regina!\n\nSo about  Mundo... It was good, but not crazy great. I would need to come back to give it a second try. \n\nWell for this try, we had the Queso Flameado which is like cheese fondue served corn tortilla. The cheese combo was really good, along with the other ingredients they put in it. Came with 3 tortillas.  \nThen for entrees we had Carnitas and Seabass. The carnitas was flavorful and sweet, reminded me of coca-cola braised pork. The portion was rather big which was great but again was served with 3 tortillas (note to the restaurant, please give at least 4 tortillas with the apps and entrees) The Seabass was wrapped in parchment and seasoned with spices. Cooked well but not my favorite because I'm not used to the spices. I'm more of a truest with fish - they need to be simply prepared so I can taste the fish.  \n\nFor dessert we had flan and it was really good but I wasn't a fan of the strawberries and fruit syrup with the caramel sauce. \n\nAbout the service, the server was nice but seemed a bit casual compared to the fine dining ambiance. I would have preferred a more professional and informed server. Maybe that's the style of the restaurant but it didn't fit. \n\nAgain, I need to come back and plan to because they have quite a bit of selection of beef entrees that looked good."
0,"Food was pretty good. As we were leaving, we handed the guy $60 cash, our meal was around $45, and he came back and said that we only gave him $40. He then left and came back with the $15. It was pretty clear that he was trying to rip us off. The music is a little loud but the service was quick. All in all, I have had better Mexican before."
1,Fantastic place for lunch. 5 star lunch or dinner with a great price. Staff was really wonderful a well.
1,"Passing by M & M Soul Food Cafe, it can easily be missed.  Good thing the BF and I have an eye out for food places all the time 'cuz we're always hungry.  From the outside, there's not much to look out.  It occupies a corner spot and after walking in, you can see tables lined up past the counter to the back.\n\nWe were told to take a seat anywhere we liked and after sliding into our booth, menus were brought over.  The waitress came by to ask if she could get us beverages and you gotta get Sweet Tea ($1.50)!  (Yum! Yum!)  \n\nPerusing through the menu, we decided to split an order since dinner was happening in a couple of hours.  We opted for the whole order of Shorts Ribs with gravy ($17.99), which is \""slowly cooked beef ribs, seasoned to perfection with gravy or BBQ.\""  The whole orders come with three sides and our choice was the collared greens, macaroni and cheese, and fried okra.  (Check out the picture!)  A half order was available for $12.99, but  I'm not sure how many sides you get with the half orders.\n\nThe wait wasn't too long for our order to come, despite the warning on the menu saying there's a 20 minute wait for fried items.\n\nThe short ribs were tender and came off the bone easily.  It was flavorful and went well with the gravy.  The macaroni and cheese was a bit bland for my tastes though, but the collared greens fared a bit better.  The BF said they could have cooked the greens a bit longer for what he likes.  We especially liked the fried okra though.  It was my first time having that and we wished we had two orders of it instead.  \n\nOther sides available included yams, black eyed peas, red beans and rice, potato salad, corn bread dressing, cabbage, string beans, and rice and gravy.  Entrees included oxtail, catfish, chitterlings, gumbo, meatloaf, fried chicken, and liver and onions.  Dessert choices were peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, and banana pudding.  \n\nService was good.  The waitress refilled our sweet tea before we had to ask and before we were even done with our first glass.  We definitely appreciate that.  She also brought out an extra plate for us so we could share our entree.  And she asked if we wanted any dessert before giving us the bill too.\n\nOverall, the sweet tea, ribs, and fried okra were good.  The other sides were just okay.  We felt that it was a bit pricey for what we got, and both expected a larger platter of ribs.  We wouldn't mind going back to try out what else they had to offer.\n\nSidenote: I'm not sure if it's intimidating or not seeing this very tall man  wiping down tables as his gun and badge bounce off his hip.     \n\nThere's an 18% gratuity added for parties of six or more.\n\nUpdate! 03/14/08 - The BF was craving their short ribs, so we ordered them up again.  This time they were  A  LOT more generous with their portions!  (It makes me wonder if we got shafted the last time - check it out and compare the pictures yourself!)  I wish we remembered not to get the mac n cheese, but we got black-eyed peas and fried okra this time too.\n\nI went for the Small Seafood Gumbo which had crab (hard to eat), chunky sausage, chicken, okra, and rice.  It's pretty generous for a small portion, but there's not all that much seafood in it.  It's super gooey from all the okra 'stuff' though.  \n\nThis time we got complimentary cornbread pancakes, two each and a side of butter.  What a nice treat while you peruse the menu.  Their sweet tea tasted a bit different than before, did they change the recipe?  Overall, a better experience than the last.  I'll up it to a 3.5 from a 3 now."
1,"If you have car issues this is the place to go!! They are just good, HONEST, hard working guys that dont try to yank your chain like some other mechanic shops. I came in the shop with a check engine light on and some much needed maintenance needed to be complete. They completed the job to perfection. They even gave me a ride home and picked me up in the morning. What automotive shop offers that type service?? Thank you Mike for all your help with my 2005 Mustang GT you were awesome to deal with. You didn't give me one quote and then jack it up when the job was completed like other auto shops are known to do. I will be using you guys to help maintain my car and refer you to anyone I know who is in need of a GOOD mechanic!!! Thanks again!!!"
1,Excellent atmosphere that really screams vegas. It's a great way to kick off your trip. Their shakes are to die for. Typically we get a burger and split the Cobb salad.
1,"Just got back from a five day stay, must say I'm very impressed to say the least. I was sent to the Residence Inn for a company training, and I was expecting typical inn type, sparse accommodations. I was pleasantly surprised when i got to my room; it was spacious, comfortable, and well laid out. It included a full kitchen, living room with a desk (open power outlets right next to the desk so that you can plug in the laptop and charge the phone made me happy!) bedroom, and large bath. I did wish the room had a safe, but I did see boxes behind the front desk. The rooms were well maintained, and extremely clean.\nThe amenities at the hotel were great: full hot breakfast each morning, coffee/ tea/water available most of the day, warm cookies in the evening, and evening socials/ dinners. Free wifi, newspaper, and a host of channels on tv let you stay connected. The pool area looked nice, but it was downright cold so I didn't actually get in. There was a nice gym, and basketball courts that I likewise did not use. \nGreat experience, I will look to Residence Inn as a lodging possibility."
1,Always the best burgers in the country
0,"I ordered the special dumpling noddle soup and to be honest, it wasn't all that special. It was pretty bland in my taste and overpriced! But then again...it IS vegas so you can't expect much. Overall experience is average."
0,"Where Do I begin!!!! Excalibur, what a nice looking hotel from the outside, stinks like an old grandpas smoky couch inside but overall would never stay here again even if I was on a really tight budget.  We got a room for $49 per night plus resort fee cost.  Checked in early and the front desk were not helpful or friendly at all. I decided to pay for another day since we were checking in at 9am.  The registration process took 35  minutes.  Was tired cause had been up all night the previous night working and wanted to sleep. Got into the room and the room that we got on tower 1 had a great view of the strip. BUTTT.... The 2 beds were almost twin size looking, the furniture was old and it wasnt just because they were going for the medieveal look.  Bathroom was horrible and dingy looking.  I say that I have stayed in nicer rooms at runned down motel 6 hotels.  We got up and just walked around because we didnt want to be in the room even if I was dead tired. When we got to our room at about 9pm, we could not stand the room and response that the front desk would give us so we packed our stuff around 11pm and walked lugging all of our luggage to the LUXOR next door (its actually a pretty far walk). We checked in for a $65 dollar rate at the escalibur and got a tower room that was beautiful and great to sleep in.  Overall the best thing about the Escalibur was their all you can eat buffet for about $35 bucks all day. BUT PLEASE NEVER INTEND TO SLEEP HERE!!"
0,"I don't know. It's okay, but I don't think it's anything special. I like shopping local like the next Gen Y kombucha drinking rescue dog owner, but the prices are too high, the layout isn't cohesive, and it's cramped and tiny. It's bodega meets whole foods, and that's cool and all, and I hope it stays open and busy, but... but, I guess I'm cool with my TJ's/AJ's/WF circuit I'm currently stringing on."
0,"First time , last time. stopped  by the drive thru for some quick food.  Someone in the family ordered a chicken wrap and that item made it a 20 minute wait.  No big deal, we are back home in Florida and Bojangles in non-existent here."
0,"I had to go home and re-shave.\n\nI scheduled an appointment for a Presidential Shave for my father, and a Presidential Shave and haircut for myself on my wedding day, with the intent of being a father-son experience.  We both had appointments scheduled for 11:00 the day of my wedding.\n\nThe facility was clean, and the staff was nice.  My father got in at 11:15, and I got in at 11:45.  Instead of us being able to experience it together, the same barber that shaved him shaved me.  So there was no experience to be had.\n\nThe worst part is, the shave was terrible.  There was still a significant amount of stubble on both of us.  My cheeks were shaved, but we both still had a 5 o'clock shadow, and even after going over my upper lip multiple times it still looked like I had not shaved.  I was expecting a ridiculously close shave since it is a professional barber shop with a straight edge but that was most certainly not the case.\n\nFor the $135 it cost for the entire package, this was not worth the time or money, especially on my wedding day.  I would recommend to anyone to save their time and money, and they will save themselves a great deal of disappointment."
1,"Screaming Orgasm Sauce...whatever dude.  Lame name and nothing special at all.\n\nI've spent quite a bit of time at Mandalay Bay and have eaten here on 3 separate occasions.  Every time has been a wonderful experience.  \n\nService is on top of their game.  There are tons of them hovering around...the most I have ever seen in a restaurant.  My water was never less than half full and dishes came out for the entire table at once, facilitated by multiple servers.\n\nThe sushi bar is where it is at though.  The O-toro sushi is absolutely amazing and very expensive at almost $40 for 2 bites.  They have some of the freshest fish I have tasted.\n\nThe food from the kitchen is just ok.  However, the miso black cod is to die for.  They cook it sous vide and it comes out perfectly!  It is a must try if you eat here.  There is also the crispy rice roll, which is memorable."
1,We didn't stay here but we came to visit specifically for the coaster. It was absolutely amazing. The price is about $14 a person but they do sell all day passes for about $25. Definitely a must do.
0,"Worst buffet ever made in vegas. Basically a rip off ($35 each), with just a straight line of selection. Food was not even that great, the only highlight was the steak, the creme brulee, and unlimited wine. But if you're at a buffet, you want various selection of food not just wine. \n\nI don't recommend this at all, especially if you're starving and they tell you that they're serving \""gourmet\"" food, most likely thats a lie."
1,If they simplified the menu a bit and didn't find ways to charge you extra for everything this place would be a 5 star hole in the wall.  Truthfully their menu has so many choices I feel overwhelmed.   I've tried a couple different burgers but I think I like the chili cheeseburger best.  Don't order doubles or anything like that for the next two simple reasons.  One they will charge you for all kinds of extras! A meal for two at a burger place that should run you $15 will run you in the upwards of $25... and Two they give you so much food you don't even need a double.
1,"Small plates of quality food differentiate this from the other buffets where they are slopping the hawgs. Yes, they place is brand new and they need to work on the kinks and minor flaws but all in very good concept that improves upon the age buffet. From Authentic sticky rice and quality sushi on one side to the short ribs and tasty small plates, these new digs aim to please a diverse group of hungry gamblers."
0,Incompetent manager that wasn't able to cancel an order on one card so it could be put on another card....luckily for this place there is no competition so their customer service can be as poor as they want it to be
0,"Ok, this is going to be long because I stayed here for 4 nights for business. This was the location of a conference and the recommended location for lodging. I can't complain too much since my company paid for lodging, food, and travel but I've stayed in MUCH better places in Vegas...\n\nI checked in at 9pm and there was only 1 person behind the counter. they could have used a 2nd person (there were about 3 people in line). I was quickly checked in to a room on the 18th floor of the north tower (view of a parking lot). The room was better than expected. Everything seemed clean and the loveseat was perfect to curl up on to do some reading.\n\nHere is some info regarding my stay-\n\nSmoke- I asked for a non-smoking room, but the entire property stinks. I think the ventilation system needs to be renewed.\n\nAir- Just because it's 106 outside doesn't mean they have to compensate by making it 46 inside. The AC was POWERFUL.\n\nFood- Sidewalk Cafe- service SUCKED. Food was ok.\nRoom Service- I had breakfast 2x in my room. Food arrived quickly, was hot, and the portions were very nice. However, they don't pick the trays up and there was food left for almost 24 hours in the hallway...eck.\nIt's a hotel in Vegas, the food is expensive.\n\nCustomer Service- very poor. The employees did not look happy to be there. No one was smiling, no one wished you a good day as you walked by. They just didn't care, and they even didn't care who knew that they didn't care!\n\nPool- GROSS! I went out at 5pm to sit in a lounge chair, have a cocktail, and read a book...the bar closed at 5 (but the pool was open until 8- that makes no sense), the chairs were not comfortable and looked really dirty, and there were stupid kids splashing in the pool."
1,"We are loyal Iceberg fans from SLC, UT.  The only negative comment I have is that occasionally they are sorely under staffed and the wait can be  10-15 minutes, but the shakes are well worth the wait.  Cindy, one of the managers is awesome!  We visit at least once a week if not more. Love it!"
1,"Family owned business. I have never had a bad experienced while dining here and I've gone a good 15 times. My family are regular customers as we often go after church service. I typically get turkey sausage links with scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes. I add a side of hash browns which 4 people can eat from. \n\nBy far the best breakfast place I've eaten at. Love the food and service. Also, their coffee is excellent! Not watered down at all.\n\nThey only take cash or checks! No credit or debit cards! Also, if you choose to dine there on a Saturday or Sunday, get the no later than 9am. The place is very very tiny and the line is out the door. Waiting time can but 20+ mins on a Sunday if you come after 10am."
0,"10 bucks for a horrible buffet in a grimy strip mall.  The irony is that the owner (according to articles on the wall) is responsible for Renu Korn in Norwalk, Ca, the best Thai place I've ever been to..."
1,VEGAN!!! They have vegan ice cream! And its Amazing! Highly reccomended! Friendly staff. Good local ice cream spot!
1,Amazing teppanyaki lunch!  Under $20 and you get a lot of food. The Kobe beef was super soft and melts in your mouth.  Make a res cause this place gets crowded.
0,"Should've taken the cue given this was the only empty restaurant around, but we were a group of starving girls who didn't want to deal with the hassle of waiting and standing around in line. Bad choice.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Heroes Sandwich, served on a pretzel roll. The chicken itself was fine but the bread was overpowering! I love my carbs; however the bread was very dry and on the verge of becoming stale. Normally I don't really pay attention to plating, but this sandwich was served on a very long plate, and it just looked lonely and weird.\n\nService was friendly and earnest enough, but very choppy, and the staff was clearly inexperienced. Also, this is a casual joint, so I thought it was very strange when they served our food in unison - out of nowhere 3 servers stepped up up to our table and it was like this awkward orchestration of serving our food. i've only seen this done in more formal dining settings, and it just doesn't really jive with the whole beer and burger vibe.\n\nDefinitely waiting in line for Noodle Asia next time, that place hits the spot!"
0,"The absolute worst management. The people are not happy, no one acts like they care if you shop there or not. They carry only the most basic items, as though it were a poorly run 7-11. I tell myself every time I go, that it will be my last trip... And then I forget since its so close to my home. But today they had there last chance at my money. I am done with them and Safeway. No stars. But I had to choose at least one"
1,"WOW!  Eating hear is truly an experience.  Part dining, and part art show.  You know it's going to be different the minute you walk in and see the modern piano black, chrome, and red decor.  Sit at the bar and watch all the action.  Part of a new trend (at least, for me) where the chefs double as servers.  They didn't offer the $75 tasting menu when we went.  Instead, we had to get the much more expensive 10 course Discovery Menu.  It was worth it.  Be prepared to sit for awhile, like at least 3 hours.  Not a good place for a pre-show dinner.  This is an event all its own.\n     Each course creative and well thought out.  Functional art.  Not only good to look at, but real delicious food.  The complex flavors and textures  always leave you wanting more.  Of course, I didn't love all the dishes.  But, that's the best part of a tasting menu for me.  I get to try out as much of the restaurant's menu including some things I wouldn't order if I was limited to a few courses.  The Discovery menu is quite adventurous and includes: foie gras in three different courses, oysters, dover sole, lobster, and smoked salmon.  We also ordered skirt steak off the a la carte menu, which was my favorite.  The simple things are done so well.  For example, the best part of the foie gras ravioli in warm chicken broth with herbs was not the ravioli, but the perfectly balanced chicken broth.  It was, hands down, the best broth I have ever had.  I wish I had gallons of this stuff.  \n     I could never justify getting the Discovery menu again but I will definitely go back for some a la carte items if I'm ever near the MGM Grand.  This is a definite must for adventurous appetites who appreciate food that is artfully and painstakingly prepared for taste and presentation.\n\nNote:  Not a good place if you go with a party of more than 4."
1,I love EVERYTHING I ordered here. Which is almost everything on the menu. My favorite is the lentil salad. I try to come here as often as I can.The desserts are delicious. Especially the chocolate leche cake. It's sooo good!  Milky & not to sweet . I always get the pitcher mojito's or pitcher sangria.\n \nService is always on point even if you come w/ big groups. They are always on top of everything. The restaurant is always clean & I like the red decor. Best tapas in vegas!
1,There's M&Ms everywhereeeeee. M&M's World is a good place to take your kids. There is a short movie to watch as well. Nothign too exciting. This store does get packed...so be prepared! I like going up the escalator and checking out the different styles of M&Ms throughout the years.
0,The worst dinner. I ordered the skate fish which was ammonia ridden to the point of making me nauseous. The waiter didn't seem surprised when brought to his attention. The manager came over but was not in any way apologetic. Absolutely no concern was shown as she couldn't be bothered by such serious food and health issues. I am thinking should at least bring this to the attention of health department.
0,"Avoid if u can. Very unpleasant experince, only one waitress and she is so unorganized. On a Tuesday night we waited for over an hour between getting the menu and someone took our order. The food is mediocre too. Worst dining experience ever."
1,"America, except California apparently, runs on Dunkin'. \n\nSurprisingly, this Dunkin' Donuts is one of the closest ones to many of us from Southern California. There's one just south of the Las Vegas Strip in Nevada, but on the Arizona side, this has to be it. Though there's one on the naval base at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, private citizens can't go onto the campus, so it essentially is inaccessible for about 95% of the population. It almost makes one want to join the military, actually.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, and as crazy as it sounds, this Dunkin' is one of the closest ones to the people of the Los Angeles region.\n\nI spent the past Thanksgiving weekend in Phoenix, and I stopped by here each morning as part of my ritual whenever I visit a city where Dunkin' Donuts flourish. I would get up before the rest of my family, and enjoy a donut and regular coffee (raspberry, creamed and sugared), as the crowds and lines would slowly start to form. If you follow my reviews, this crowding after I arrive always occurs whenever I visit a restaurant or establishment, and it happened each morning during the Thanksgiving weekend here. \n\nOnce my order was claimed, I always insisted on eating there, as I don't like eating in my vehicle, or really having food in it. There is a drive-thru here, however, for those that don't care for the interiors of their cars. I do like how this location delegates the coffee making responsibility to others, and to have you pick up your order off to the side; it makes for faster overall service with the rest of the queue.\n\nI'm actually one of those people who always completes those surveys on the receipts so as to get a free donut on my next visit. Considering that I essentially swing by each day, doing those surveys is essentially a 50% discount off my bill each visit, and I really only pay for the coffee. It's made even easier if you have a smart phone and can do it on the spot. I know what you're thinking...what about that last receipt before you went back to California? Did you do that survey? The answer is: Yes. And it's folded and in my wallet, ready to be brought out the next time I encounter a Dunkin' Donuts location. \n\nThe tax here is generally lower than what I experience back in California, so whatever few cents it saves me in sales tax is always welcomed, even if I can't really compare it with another California Dunkin' Donuts. I did notice that the prices for milk and water in the refrigerator were too high, however (even by Los Angeles standards). Then I realized that because this is some of the hottest deserts in the country, water may be more of an expensive thing around these parts.\n\nThe service, was very attentive and great. The donuts I sought were always in stock and tasted fresh. You can tell a good quality donut because you never see cracks in the glazing. I only wish that they install a television, set to the news or something entertaining, so that diners could have something to look at other than their phones or other people.\n\nSpeaking of which...on a side note, while visiting here, I was keenly aware that I was the only Asian person here each time (and probably the only one on any given day). Though I was aware of it, it was kinda interesting seeing how other customers looked at me. It could have also been the way I parked the car (which was fast and with California plates), dressed (which was business-like, but wouldn't draw a second glance in Los Angeles), or had brief verbal exchanges (but polite). Children especially, who haven't yet learned the art of discretion, essentially gawked at me and were surprised at my \""Californian accent\"" (we don't actually have one) and how tall I was for an Asian. (I did notice I was consistently one of the tallest people there each morning, which isn't saying much, because I'm of average height around Southern California). I knew this because I could hear them \""whispering\"" it to their parents, who would reply back to them that I'm probably visiting from out of town. \n\nI just laughed, looked at the parents, and replied, \""cute kids.\"""
1,"I can not say enough about Murphy's Law.  I LOVE this place.  I stopped in last year when planning my Vegas wedding to see if it would be a good place to have my wedding reception.  I didn't even look anywhere else. There was no need; they had everything I was looking for.  The bar is beautiful; brick work every where, great patio, nice lounge area with plush couches.  And The Chef and owner we met with could not have been nicer.  They seemed excited to have a wedding reception there, something not everyone I had contacted in Vegas was supportive of, and assured me it would be wonderful.  Fast forward a year and they were right.   We had our wedding reception there on Friday March 11th, and things went of beautifully.  My guests, my husband, and I had an amazing time, the food was great, and the drinks were pouring, and beer pong was a blast.  Jeff was so accommodating through out the whole process.  When a too drunk friend was sent to set up and went MIA, Jeff put everything together for us before we even knew what had happened.  And Shelly, was great as well, the entire staff ensured we had an amazing evening.  Thank you all for making my wedding so great."
0,Welcome to the Wal Mart of casinos. This casino aint done nothing for nobody nowhere.
0,"I'll start from the top. \nI called for a reservation and the hostess said \""the restaurant isn't even halfway full, so it doesn't really matter what time you come\"". Should have been a red flag.\nWhen we got there, it appeared that the hostess didn't know what to do with us....she stood holding menus staring into \""not even half-full\"" dining room for a good couple of minutes. We ended up at a pretty nice table though and the waiter came over right away. However, the very little english he spoke was barely understood as he whispered his way though his introduction. The drink order ended up being 2 glasses of white wine, a glass of red wine and a beer. 15 minutes later, he came with 3 glasses of white wine. Um...\nWe corrected him and he got us the right drinks and took our food orders. I ordered the pork chop and strongly emphasized my desire to have it very well done. All the while straining to hear his broken english. \nThe food came, my pork was pink throughout. My fiance's steak was rare (he asked for medium) and his father's gravy was that out of a McCormick's dry seasoning package from the grocery store. I sent back the pork to have it cooked further and they, kindly enough, took it off the check because the waiter was clearly in the wrong. There was this \""apple chutney\"" on the chop and anyone could've given me a side of canned apples with cinnamon flavoring and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. The mashed potatoes were cold and had questionable chucks in it, that I really don't think were just un-mashed potato and the asparagus tasted like dirt. \nThey gave us a free appetizer coupon because of the trouble, which was also a nice gesture but to be completely honest, I don't know that we'll ever go back there. Maybe just to drink and as long the person waiting on us knows the difference between red and white wine. We'll wait til they start washing their veggies before we ever eat there again though...."
1,"Great Restaurant.  Expecting a mediocre meal, we were pleasantly surprised when the server brought our food.  It was extremely fresh with unique flavors.  This is a Vegas must have."
1,"Kids love this place. They can spend all day here. Buy the membership its worth it, with just 2-3 visits you have gotten your money's worth and you have a year's worth of visits to go for free!  Well, at least this is how I sell it to my self. Things to do with your kids:  climb the \""tree,\"" run the noodle forest, play with the car racers, and play with the marbel/ball obstacle course."
1,"I love this place!! I eat right next door to it about once a week and always stop by and pick up a new book. I love the racks they have outside and randomly selecting a book by an author I've never heard of and giving it a whirl. Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't but it is fun. One time, I gave my snake some beer; he was slithering this way and that MAN!!"
0,This is sort of a cute wayside ice cream stand but the food is less than average and the ice cream is ok.  I haven't been there in over 10 years.  what does that say?
1,"Really one of my favorite places to go to a few times a week for drinks or dinner. Well known for its elegance and sophisticated style dining and a hot spot for locals and celebrities, politicians and the worlds movers and shakers. The staff from valet drivers to bartenders and management will treat you like family especially if you're a regular patron. Live singer performers on the weekend too."
1,"Steaks: prima Fleischqualit\u00e4t, wie gew\u00fcnscht medium  lecker!\nPommes: sch\u00f6n cross, gut gesalzen  lecker!\nSo\u00dfe: Knoblauchrahm  hervorragend!\nBeilagensalat: reichlich, Dressing lecker! Dass bei einer gr\u00f6\u00dferen Veranstaltung nur eine eingeschr\u00e4nkte Speisekarte angeboten wird ist zwar schade, geht aber prinzipiell in Ordnung. Dass dabei die Vegetarier/Salat-Fans bzw. Leute mit vielleicht nicht so gro\u00dfem Hunger nicht ber\u00fccksichtigt, nur Wurstsalat angeboten und auch auf Anfrage (obwohl ja  siehe Beilagensalat  eigentlich alle Zutaten vorhanden waren) die Zubereitung eines gro\u00dfen Salats abgelehnt wurde, fanden wir hingegen nicht so toll  daher nur 4 Sterne. EDIT: Hagsfelder Stuben revisited: Das Essen bleibt weiterhin sehr lecker, wenngleich das Fleisch diesmal von der Zubereitung durchg\u00e4ngig eher am unteren Ende der medium-Skala angesiedelt war ich kenne auch Leute, die so etwas st\u00f6ren w\u00fcrde. Hausgemachte Sp\u00e4tzle k\u00f6nnten das Essen noch zus\u00e4tzlich aufwerten!"
0,"After the change of ownership, this place is horrible now.  It's just too salty!"
0,"The room was loaded with dust in areas not easy for housekeeping to reach, causing us some respiratory issues at night.  Traffic noise disturbed my wife.  We were charged for an upgraded room without our knowledge.  Furnishings were from 1980.  Casino reeked of cigarette smoke.  Check-in line was 45 minute wait.  Convention area was nice."
1,The decor is great at all the Cargo Coffee shops. The staff is nice. I have only had a breakfast sweet roll to eat. I've had the tea and it's very good.
0,"bleh. i hate this place with a passion and avoid like the plague. i'm happy to pay marginally higher prices elsewhere to not have to set foot in this place. this particular location is slightly better than most i've seen, hence the 1 star but that's all it has going for it."
0,"FYI, I just called and Penazzi is no longer open."
0,"This review is for customer service attitude.\nThis cigar club is located right next to the Ravella hotel and we were just lucky enough to stay the nights where they have a horrid horrid horrid (yes it's that bad) band playing live music right at bedtime.\nI don't know how it is in Las Vegas with the noise level but in California, restaurants/clubs right by residences follow a strict quiet policy after 10pm. I have seen police being called to clubs when residents complain.\nApparently they do not have that in Las Vegas.\nThe band started playing at 8:00pm and the first night -Friday, they music went on till midnight. Other people in the hotel had also called our hotel front desk to request that the bar turn the music down. Really, how loud does it have to be when you have tall buildings surrounding the stage to amplify sound anyway?  \nI had called the bar myself and ask to speak to the manager personally.\nBlair, the manager told me that she personally turned the music down twice and that she was watching the meter. She couldn't turn it down any further because she has to run a business. \n\nMight I remind you, there is no business running to be had if there are no people staying at the Ravella so a little consideration might go a long way.\n\nShe also added that there are other restaurants playing live music and she enumerated them one by one. How professional of you to try to place blame on others too. These other establishments were a good distance from the hotel and their music can barely be heard. I would have at least been pacified if Blair had been nice about saying she had to run a business, but no, she was pretty rude. \nIf you're going to risk irritating and keep guests up with loud music, at least let it be good music! \nI don't know about you but why would I want to patronize a place where management are inconsiderate to people that COULD  have come invariably to the establishment. Thank god what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I check out tomorrow. Goodbye and good riddance."
1,"I don't know how long they've had deep dish slices, but I've never seen them until this recent visit.  \n\nWe grabbed up a pepperoni deep dish which was pretty decent, but not close to my favorite. The plus is that its nicely crispy and not doughy, lots of pepperoni  and sauce and cheese in it. Its much more filling than the thin slice so I suppose you get more bang for your buck with that.  \n\nWe got a slice of white pizza as well. This is one of my favorites here and the BF liked it a lot too. Its also good with their sliced sausage on it. I think if you wan't something besides a basic pepperoni, I think this is the best one they have to offer. Slices start at $4.50 for a already made slice or you can order in a whole pizza as well (I believe the last time I ordered one it was about $20ish for a 1 topping). Of course, having it fresh made is slightly better than getting a slice that's been sitting. They serve a few beers on tap or soda, and there is a water dispenser out with water cups. Other than that, they serve nothing else - just 'za! \n\nI think the \""secret pizza\"" is not so secret, but if you aren't sure where it is, it's on the same floor as most of their restaurants. It's right next to Blue Ribbon Sushi, you'll just see a random corridor of albums and you'll see a arcade machine visible at the end. Theres some stools or standing bar. You can walk your slice out into lobby of this area as there's plenty of seating and a pool table even. \n\nGood quick bite when here in Cosmo, a good idea to order a pizza instead of room service, not something I would venture to the strip just to get though. Still, I am a fan and manage to end up here every time I'm on the property!"
0,Can we say nasty?!?!?  Good thing I didn't have to pay for it. Would def not come back even if it comes with free and free beer
1,"Received an email from Terry at D'Vine with offer to reserve comfy couches in back of bar for playoff games.  To our surprise, we basically were the only ones there watching.  Lots of people eating and drinking but not really watching game.  Was low key viewing with no yelling, screaming, etc. and was really a nice change.  Wine as always is available in all price points and wait staff extremely knowledgeable. Offer still open for playoffs so take advantage of this cool spot with laid-back atmosphere."
0,"Ive never felt sooooo screwed!!! \n\n I went there to kill an hour and wanted to rent a 9mm.  I told the guy I wanted a 9mm and filled out the paperwork.  He walked me to the lane with the gun and a yellow plastic parts bin with some ammo in it.  I figured he was going to set me up and supervise the first few rounds to see if I knew what I was doing...which he did.\n\nAfter emptying the clip I asked him where the extra rounds were.  He said that was all of them (4 remaining of 20).  I said, oh OK I guess I would need to purchase a full box of ammo to continue shooting.  He said I would be required to buy another complete \""package\"" which was $25 for a gun and 20 extra rounds.  I shook my head in disbelief.  I assumed I could shoot all day as long as I was buying thier ammo, renting the lane, buying thier targets and renting thier guns.  That was not the case.  When I was done shooting in all of 2 minutes I told him what bulls#@! I thought that was and how screwed I felt..\n\nI and not a regular range shooter so I just sucked it up and figured next time I went anywhere I would have to ask if they were like any real range or do they screw you $25 at a time like the Vegas Machine Gun Experience."
0,SOOOOOOOOO disappointed with the Culinary Dropout.  I came here not once but twice in the same weekend.  \n\nThe first was for beers (a good selection) and enjoyed the artichoke (if a bit watery) and the soft pretzels bites with (really thin) provolone fondue. \n\nThe second time was for bunch on a Sunday.  Service was super slow and forgetful. The worst part was the biscuits and sausage gravy.  It was tomato-y.  TOMATO.  I just... *shivers* I don't want to talk about it.  It was a terrible experience.
1,Love this club!!!! Will definitely be back again
1,"Enjoyed Passport's freshly brewed java at Dimi Espresso, in Payson recently.  We then bought a pound o' beans to take home.  Just got to them this week.  Freshly ground and roasted in our semi-pro espresso machine, Passport is easily amongst the top five brews that have come out of our machine in the past 10 years!  The espresso is strong, full bodied, ultra (and I truly mean ULTRA) smooth, with no hint of bitterness, and just the right amount of brightness.  Truly a perfect cup o' brew.  If only we could bring Passport to San Antonio, Tejas.  OVERALL: STELLAR.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,"I'm rather surprised I have not reviewed Fontanella yet - one of the best places for southern Italian food in Charlotte!\n\nThe owners are no strangers to restaurants - this is not their first successful Italian place in Charlotte. Hailing from Italy, they bring an authenticity and richness to their business that chains can only hope to poorly recreate. Dark and intimate, the servers and hosts go out of their way to make you feel at home.  There are two ladies who normally take care of us - they remember our names and what we normally like to order, something that rarely happens these days.\n\nThe food is incredible.  Nothing too fancy, just great tasting old-world-style dishes at a great price (and hearty portions, too). The veal dishes are a personal favorite of mine.  Not authentic, but they do pizza very well, too.\n\nA great way to introduce yourself if you have never been is their expansive lunch buffet. You can sample many of the headliners on the dinner menu as well as a few other gems that are exclusive to lunch."
0,"We have not been here for a few years and the last time it was quite good...things have definitely changed!  Overall the dining room was dirty, way too bright, just too many senior citizens (sorry)!  Then came the food...small portions, very salty, very prepackaged feeling, not good!  The server was overbearing and the overall value was poor."
1,"I am now a huge fan of Switch. This awesome steak and seafood house located in the Encore was one of the finest meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. It's also home to the largest wine list I have ever laid eyes on.\n\nOur server, Will was one of the main contributing factors to this as well as the amazing food and a restaurant ambiance that hasn't seen it's equal. \n\nWill was very patient with us as we looked over the menu. The level of quality service that he provided was astounding. He offered thorough explanations as well as suggestions on what we should try. We ended up ordering the lobster mac and cheese, green tea spiced ahi, and Montana bison. Yes, bison.\n\n-Vermont cheddar mac and cheese with Maine lobster: $18\nA very perfect portion of the best mac and cheese this stomach has ever digested. We both don't like mac and cheese but loved this one. The lobster portions in here were nicely cut and prepared. \n\n-Green tea spiced ahi tuna: $42\nThis was served with lentils and endive. It was a HUGE cut of ahi. Very fresh and seared to perfection. The green tea added a nice dimension of flavor here. I've had a lot of seared ahi in my day but none like this. Amazing.\n\n-Montana bison rib eye : $48\nThis was served with a very nice port wine sauce. It was cooked medium well and it remained juicy throughout. The bison was very lean and tasted very clean. It had no gamey taste at all. Very impressive.\n\n-Caramelized profiteroles : $12\nThink of these as very small cream puffs. I had never heard of this dessert before dining at Switch. The puffs were full of flavor and very light. It was the perfect way to end the meal. We didn't want to get bogged down at all: we had shopping to do.\n\nSo why call this place Switch? Well every 20 minutes the restaurant itself transforms. Wall panels give way to one of three different types and even the ceiling opens up and recesses to give a different point of decor for the discerning customer. This was a very nice touch and although I knew it was going to happen ahead of time thanks to Yelp reviews, they can't really prepare you for the real deal. I had never seen anything like it before in my life.\n\nSo thank you Switch, Will, and Montana bison for a culinary experience that will always be remembered."
1,Outstanding! We had to come back two nights later. The manager Derek made it so enjoyable he was one of the reasons we came back. The food is great and the prices are awesome! A must go while in Vegas!
1,"Sushi Fever is my favorite mid-priced Sushi joint in Vegas.  The fish is always fresh, and they have a wide range of creative, signature rolls.  My personal favorites are the Mexican roll and the Dale Earnhardt roll.  Not quite sure why they equated Dale Earnhardt with soft shell crab, but it works.  \n\nIt's a bit pricier than other sushi places around town, but it's less than what you'll find on the strip or in off-strip casinos, and the freshness and creativity are worth a few extra bucks."
1,"So I know my past review was a little rough, but my second and definitely short visit was able to calm my senses. This company really strives to make sure that their customer satisfaction is truly guaranteed. The owner, Brooke, is super nice and addressed my concerns in such a kind manner. I happened to have time to stop by today for some pineapple whip and she wasn't there but I thought I would give it a try anyway. The guy ended up being another owner, her husband, and he was very friendly and knew about my situation because she spoke with him about it! They definitely didn't treat me differently because of my bad review, but they just understood where I was coming from. It seemed to have been an error with Groupon's company so I'm currently trying to get that fixed at the moment! For now, he offered me some whip and I was such a happy happy camper. Once again, texture was perfect and flavor was on point! Their menu was different than the first time I came and it was written on a chalk board! Really cute! He said they're adding more things to the menu and spicy-ing the place up a bit so I'm looking forward to the new changes. They definitely have an awesome lil shop and what I've had so far is great. I can't wait to keep coming back and trying new things. Just wish they were closer to home! Truly my new go-to dessert stop. If you're in the area, you gotta try it."
0,"First and last time.  Not overly picky when I am ordering pizza for delivery but this pizza has no flavor.  Just moved to Chandler...never heard of the place...didn't look at yelp.  I would choose Domino's over this and I am not a fan of Domino's.  The delivery was slow but it was also the NCAA championship night so was fine with that.  The delivery person came back about 20 min later as he said he forgot to give us our 2 liter bottle of soda and bread...I had not ordered them.  He said they came free with every order so if that if the case, I applaud them for that!"
1,"Really enjoyed this Cantonese style Chinese. Decent Cantonese noodles, and great Peking Duck. In fact some of the best Peking Duck I've had in some time, and I've searched high and low for good duck :-)\n\nGet there early for lunch on the weekends, this place gets crazy fast!"
1,"Amazing, delicious, possibly the only thing of value in Phoenix (sorry phoenizites, i hated your city). Came here on a recommendation of a pizza nut (who for the record is born, raised and spent her entire life in New York, so she knows her pizza). \n\nDefinitely the California style of pizza more so than the new york style, and since i was moving from california to new york at the time, I was still all about CA style food. Have had very similar pizza in Berkeley at Cheeseboard, as well as A16 in San Francisco, so this style pizza is certainly not new to me. I don't think it was the best of this kind i've ever eaten (A16 gets that) but still very very good. \n\nThere was an hour wait when we showed up so we saddled over to the wine/beer bar next door (genius!) and had some really good local arizona beers. really good beers. i wish i remembered what they were called cause they were probably the best over my entire roadtrip.\n\nGot seated in super cosy trattoria. Had pizza with sausage, cheese and arugula, very good. Great bottle of wine too. \n\nIf i ever end up in Phoenix again (god i hope not), i am coming straight here."
0,The store has some sick gear but honestly some of the employees do a really lousy job. I've gone in twice now and gotten no help whatsoever until I approach the employee who's just sitting down behind the desk. I hate being bothered by employees but they could at least come off helpful and not give one word answers for everything. I was the only person in the store and they were extremely unhelpful and slightly condescending. \n\nJust don't expect to be helped too much. Other than the service it's one of the few places in Scottsdale that carries rare stuff. That's the only reason I return haha.
1,"We were hesitant because there was no one else there when we walked in on a Friday night at 9pm. Almost turned around and left, but we decided to stick it out.  Glad we did.\n\nKushi age was tasty, especially with the sauce and spicy salt. Yellowtail carpaccio and salmon & avocado salad were excellent. And udons (regular and curry) were solid.  \n\nService was attentive - water, tea and soda (free refills) glasses were always kept full."
1,"Excellent! Service is amazing and also has the most fresh sashimi in Henderson! We love it, we go there at least once a week!"
0,"We went here new years eve. Somebody told me it was good. We get inside and I order a beer. They tell there is no alcohol. It says there is on the website. The place is so quiet. No music on at all. I mean really quiet. No ambiance. Everyone that worked there looked like they just left the couch. The older man, maybe owner, was in sweat pants, a sweat shirt and dirty baseball cap. His kid, or a kid, probably 15 years old. Was in gym shorts and a dirty t-shirt. Not what you want serving you your food. The crepe appetizer was ok. The vermicelli had no taste. I poured 4 cups of whatever the sauce is on the side over it. I will not be going here again. Better food up the street."
0,"Palace Station can Fuck off !!  And because you guys suck so bad, i'm thinking i might just avoid the rest of the station casinos and the bummer is i like the oyster bar. i'll survive without it !"
1,"What a fun, hidden Phoenix gem! \n\nThis isn't your fancy Scottsdale resort by any means, but we had a great girls night here using a Groupon - $49 for the night.\n\nThe restaurant - Gallo Blanco - was great, the rooms, pool and lobby were all clean and really uniquely decorated.\n\nThe staff was the BEST, and the snacks after 10pm were the perfect added touch of service.\n\nWalking distance to a lot of fun restaurants and bars as well. We'll definitely be back!"
0,"Arrived at Bouchon for a dessert on a Sunday night. Was seated promptly and given menus and waters. All desserts are $9. \n\nProvided that this was just dessert and the reputation of Bouchon, I had high expectations as I walked across the dining room to our appointed table.\n\nMy boyfriend decided on the creme carmel. Upon its arrival to the table I was disappointed by its lackluster appeal. There it was, a gelatinous blob, sitting in a shallow pool of its caramel juices. No spun sugar garnish, let alone any garnish - what you see, is what you get. \n\nLooks aside, we dug in into the thick creme to find...nothing special. Being a classic french dessert, I expected some care and thought - when really I felt the Bouchon chefs put the item on the menu haphazardly. Disgrace! I might as well be dining at the Left Bank on the offside of a shopping mall. \n\nComing back for more? Perhaps for a dinner of moules-frittes, but definitely not for the sweets selection, but looking at the prices listed on the menu - there are other places where I would rather invest my dollar into a fine dining experience\n\nPerfect for:\n* a group of four or less"
1,This is a place that is always good for lunch.  I also must say it is a perfect venue for a nice event.
0,"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to. \n\nMy last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.  \n\nI drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.\n\nOn other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!"
0,"We were out in Scottsdale on a Saturday afternoon, and we had read decent reviews of this place on Yelp.  I was amazed at how bad this place was! I am so tired of poorly executed places that charge a premium (for the category) and deliver poorly.  This place is really awful.  It tries to be trendy with the wait-team dressed in striped blue knit shirts that look like they have been washed a few too many times.  The food is fair to poor, presented in a heaped plating style that was not appetizing.  I had a salmon entree and my friend a chicken dish.  Neither was really special in any way.  Chips are good, salsa is not. Drinks are way overpriced.  The  \""house\"" 'Rita was $8 and was small, really too sweet and totally unforgettable. There are many, many better places out there.  This one has a bunch of Scottsdale, tired wannabes as patrons (I agree with Jenny R.!), and an untrained staff.  Our waitperson was OK in the beginning, but she disappeared at the end.  Our final drink was served 10 minutes after we finished our meal, at least 15 minutes after we ordered it!  We almost called 911 to file a \""missing waitperson\"" report.  Instead, $75.00 later (for three drinks and two entrees, tax and tip), we left and we will not be back."
0,"Our experience seems to be the only rare bad one...however, there were good and bad things and I will highlight on both.\n\nFirstly the service was terrible.  Our server seemed like she had just come from serving at Chili's because she couldn't or would try to pronounce the name of our wine when she brought it out.  Secondly, she ruined 3 bottles of wine, attempting to open them, while spilling some on my boyfriend. Finally she had to sommelier come and open our actual bottle of wine. Which are very reasonably priced and they have a great selection of bottles and by the glass. The sommelier was very accomodating which made up for the amatuer server.  \n\nFood wise, we ordered the crab cakes and the bleu cheese caesar salad which were both great.  The bleu cheese idea I thought was ingenious, it really brought out different flavors in the salad dressing.  The crab cakes, were really moist and the aioli that it came with was equally delicious. \n\nOur main courses were a filet mignon and the smoked salmon, scallop linguini.  Starting off with the good: the linguini was perfection! The sauce was not overly heavy with cream but mingled greatly with the whole sea scallops which were seared and succulently sweet.  The smoked salmon, I thought was a great compliment to the dish, it was not fishy at all and it tasted really fresh. Kudos!\n\nHowever, the filet was a a different story.  It seemed like it had great promise and the server actually recommended it.  The menu said \""blackberry pinot noir reduction\""...the filet was marinated in an espresso thing of some sort.  When the steak came out, the \""reduction\"" was more like a jello, which was the first thing that I tasted when I took a bite, it seemingly gelatinized on me...the steak was cooked just fine, it was the sauces that really ruined the dish. \n\nThe final thing menu item that was so good...I might drive all the way to sunset and vines again for...it was this proscuitto wrapped pototoes gratin...AMAZING! So amazing that I ate 2 of them.  \n\nOverall...not so good..but the things that were good...ended up being amazing.\n\nThe ambience was great and romantic with a view of the Lake Las Vegas."

1,"Tonight was my first visit. My hubby and I walked there cause it's close by. The owner is very friendly and will make pizza the way you like it. We got the meat pie and I added jalapenos on half of it. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised when we got home! Everything is made from scratch and incredibly delicious! There was a party in my mouth and everyone was invited! I highly recommend this place for a yummy pizza and great customer service. They are now on my regular list."
0,"I'll start by saying we didn't eat here, we just wanted refreshments on a hot day!  The place is cute, clean and I would've thought about going back to have something to eat if ever in the area.  \n\nBut, their service is horrible - absolutely rude and condescending.  If you are able to make out what they are saying . . . I don't speak Chinese so perhaps that's on me, but I didn't realize that's what it took.  There were two females at the counter when we walked up and one just looked at us (yes, we were clothed, yes, we were clean, and yes, we smiled when we walked in) and the other said, \""what u like?\""  Whoa, wait a minute!  The bartender kept looking at me, but never smiled and never offered to help, much less mutter a \""hello\"".  Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!! \n\nI had a Green Tea Boba Tea and my daughters and their friend had strawberry and passion fruit snow ice, that also was tasty and they said it was yummy.  I am pretty sure fresh fruit is used as the mango snow ice is deemed 'seasonal' and it wasn't available as that is typically a summer fruit.  My tea was good, but not enough to bring me back to bad service.  There's no excuse, there are many other tea houses in the area.  Call me spoiled . . ."
0,"I rarely write negative reviews, usually only positive ones, but this was one of those experiences. \n\nWow. This was by far our worst dining experience in Vegas.  It was the worst spent $700 ever. We made a reservation for 7 people about 1 month ago since we were going to be in town for a trade show. Our last appointment ran late, so four of us showed up the restaurant late. 3 were already there, but couldn't be seated until the missing 4 arrived. They could have been ordering drinks and appetizers, but instead, the table sat empty.  \n\nWe arrived and were told that we could eat, but that we would have to be out of our table by 9. Okay, that is fair, but how they treated us after that was not.  \n\nWe had plenty of time to eat, in fact we finished 20 minutes before 9. But we kept getting pushed...the waiter first said that he would choose out appetizers (because us reading the menu for 2 mins was too much) He kept reminding us that we were in a hurry. We rushed through our food and at 8:40 the waiter gave us dessert menus, threw some fiddle faddle packages, courtesy of the chef, on the table, and said that we could choose dessert and that we MIGHT have time to eat it.  Seriously guy? \n\nGratuity was included. We didn't give a penny more.  On the way out we commented to the hostess that they could have handled that situation way differently.  Understating that we had to be done by 9, they could have sped things up in the kitchen instead of constantly reminding us that we needed to rush. She argued with us instead of apologizing.  That is not customer service. \n\nEven more disappointing, we LOVE Michael Mina restaurants.  And planned ALL Michael Mina restaurants for our trip. This Michael Mina restaurant let us down :( But--American Fish (Aria) and Michael Mina (Bellagio) are both excellent!!!"

0,"My husband, and I, often dine here on Friday or Saturday nights for their Prime Rib & Crab.  Last few times we came, there were knats flying near & on our food, the prime rib looked days old & it tasted that way too.  The buffet selection looked old & unappealing & usually my favorite part, the crab legs, were salty, like they were soaked for too long in water & salt.  The quality has really gone out the door, which explains why there are very little customers, plus the prices have gone up dramatically!!  Hope they read this, cause they need to improve in a major way!  I spoke to one of the managers regarding the prime rib, but the reaction was like he did not care!!  Never again!"
1,"Before breakfast, my coworkers and I took some time to root some of our employees on at the Table Tennis Corporate Challenge finals.  It was a pretty long morning and really built up our appetites.  Since we were downtown, we wanted to come and try this place that's been stirring up some pretty cool reviews.  It was in a pretty sketchy casino, but we were reassured that we would be blown away.  There was only one way to find out!\n\nDu-Par's has a few rooms.  When you enter the location, the first room was nothing but the same color of wood throughout the walls, floors and tables.  There was a glass case with a bunch of HUGE pastries but I honestly felt the room was really dated.  Maybe that was the theme they were going for?  I tried to look past the first room but our party actually got sat there as well.  When our server greeted us, I quickly realized that it was definitely their theme.  Her outfit was clearly out from the 1960's diner catalog.  Such a cute outfit and it definitely brought the experience to life!  In terms of the service, I was super impressed!  Our server was personable and REALLY attentive.  In fact, there were a couple of servers who came around throughout our meal, to take away plates, refill our waters and serve our food!  Awesome!\n\nFor breakfast, I was told I NEEDED to get their pancakes.  I decided just to get one for around $5 as I heard it was huge.  Boy was that the most amazing pancake I've ever had!  The cake was fluffy, light and super big!  No need for butter, just add some syrup and you are taken to an amazing experience!  My goodness, that pancake was awesome! For my meal, I had to get my go-to breakfast, the Corned Beef Hash for $12.55.  The corned beef hash is their personal recipe, served with two eggs and Du-Par's signature hash browns.  The hash was on-point.  Once again, probably the best corned beef hash I've ever tasted.  The hash was seasoned perfectly and fried crispy. If corned beef hash is your thing, you have GOT to try this out!  \n\nI'm glad that we were referred here. It was either Du-Pars or Hash House, and boy am I glad we came here instead.  I thought I tried every restaurant in the downtown area, but I was wrong.  I absolutely struck gold on this visit.  You should definitely try this place out.  Get the pancakes and you will go nuts!"
1,Two Cirque's worth seeing in Las Vegas are KA and Mystere. KA for the stage and Mystere for the more traditional Cirque type shows. O if you like seeing people flopping around in water tanks...
1,The wife and I love to go to this place from time to time. The decor is modern and clean and the food is great. I must admit that we have only ordered a few things off of the menu but they are so good we are scared to venture to much on the menu. The fried chicken and the lamb chops are the gems of this menu. I also had one of their infused vodka martinis the last time we went and it was great. We hear that the brunch is equally amazing. Love this place.
0,"The place itself was interesting and Las Vegas themed through out. \n\nService was a bit slow sometimes so once again another restaraunt i am not blown away by at all as far as our waiter/waitresses.\nWe had gone with a lot of people for a fantasy football draft party type shin-dig. But you would think if a waiter/waitress has a big party they would want to work it to their best effort by making sure everyone is satisfied.  A lot of people were getting annoyed by the waiter forgetting about their drinks or not coming around often enough.\n\nLets get to the FOOD: i had ordered a turkey burger \""The gobbler\"" to be somewhat healthy for the night.  It came out piping hot! awesome.  But...The turkey was bland. my mustard, ketchup, and pickle made it better but nothing Rachel ray mouth watering gurgling noises came out of me at all. I was starving so you would think with me being starving that someone definitely would have heard some sort of a mmmm oh my god yumm of some sort. Nope. None.  Tasted like i could have made the same thing for the same price but made 4 burgers instead even though it wasn't stellar.  My boyfriends buffalo chicken tender sandwich looked more mouthwatering than my plate. The fries were decent enough and i happened to steal off his plate when he wasn't looking.  I had ordered the red cabbage cole slaw which was awesome too especially with the french fries! YUM. Those two things together were awesome! Not too many beers on draft. Disappointed with that for sure.\n\nIf we go to this location again with friends i will definitely order something else because everyone elses plate looked more amazingly mouthwatering than mine.\n:("
1,"This is my second time to this location, and my trillionth time to Quiznos! Just like always it taste amazing! I love their sandwiches and it puts subway under the table. At this location the staff is nice, and can take multiple orders at once and not mess up! They make the line move fast! This time I got the traditional on jalape\u00f1o cheddar bread and it was delicious and I highly recommend!"
0,"Food is good but their service is getting worse each time.\nWe came as a party of 7 and the bill was $208.38 which has already included 18% gratuity. We paid cash and added extra $4 to make it 20% gratuity.\nWe went downstairs and this waitress named Mami yelled from upstairs saying that we owed her $1. It was very embarrassing for our whole group because of her action chasing after us with the bill in her hand. Everyone from the tea station was looking at us.\nMy sister went upstairs and talked to her.\nThe amount for the food was $169 and they automatically added 18% gratuity which was $208.38. We paid them in cash $212 with the extra $4. Someone internally from their restaurant took away that $4. \nWell $1, $4.. Whatever it was that not our main concern... Is it proper to yell and chase after customer for 38 cents short from the gratuity so that whole mall can hear that??!!!\nThere was no apology from her at all.\nNo matter how awesome the food is... lousy customer service can turn customers away. That's really too bad... We used to visit this restaurant every time we visit Vegas. No more!!!"
1,Midori really is as good as it gets.  You'll find no better source of fresh and beautifully prepared sushi...all at a great value.  Every time I try another sushi restaurant I end up thinking that I wish I'd gone to Midori.  Truly great service too.  Highly recommend!
0,"Maybe I went on an off night, but I did not have a great experience.\n\nI ordered the beer-braised short rib ($18) and it was SALTY.  Holy shit, it was so salty. Like, so salty I had to stop eating it.  But, even without the salt, I wouldn't have finished it because the short rib was really fatty.  A really bad cut.  The sauce on the seasonal vegetable mix was also a turnoff; I felt all the flavors in this dish really clashed.  The mash of the day was also the victim of oversalting.  Yeah, not ordering this again.\n\nAlso, I was seated near the bathroom and there was a putrid smell in the air.  I don't want to think about what it was, but it was awful. They need to take care of that (other people remarked on it too while walking by).\n\nHighlights:  my well-mixed whiskey cocktail, friendly service, and the tasty Parmesan crisps.\n\nI hear such great things about this place.  I'll have to go back and try something else.....but I am afraid."
0,I had the Carnitas burrito. It was hands-down the worst Carnitas burrito I've ever had in my life.\nMaybe everything else tastes pretty good but that was disgusting.
1,"Return visit for work.  I was training a new hire, and remembered this great little shop. Not a good place to study:/ or have a work conversation. Too much noise between the 90s music and staff... Still great coffee but not a place to concentrate:)."
0,"Not a great Hertz location and they need much better signage and training.  I have been Hertz Gold Presidents Circle for the past 7 years, so I do know a thing about the car rental process, globally.\n  At this location, they did give me keys and directions to car lot, but signage is poor at night, as worse, there was no one to address my NeverLost  being defective, issue.\n\nBasically, they have a shared lot 1/3 mile away from rental counter, with no visible signs directing folks. \n\nCar was ok otherwise.  Yes, I have had FAR better at other Hertz locations.  Yes I have had far better at other car rental companies."
1,Had a great meal with friends and co-workers.  Had an easy time reserving a table for seven and the service was prompt and the food was enjoyable.  One of the things I like is the openness of the restaurant and the ambiance that is created.
0,"A very below mediocre cafe that people probably go because they are too hung over or there is absolutely nothing else to eat.  Came here with a huge party right before they closed at 2pm.  The service is really slow here and  you'll have to ask for everything twice, that is if you can flag down a waitress and get their attention, but they were nice, just not very attentive. \n\nThe food is not impressive at all.  My pancakes were were dry and I asked for soft scrambled eggs, which still came out looking like regular scramble.  I also ordered a plate of steamed vegetables, you know, so I can eat my veggies for the day.  Little did I know that the whole plate of veggies are completely doused in butter that glistens so much that I can see my own face.\n\nUnless you really have to, there so much good food in Vegas, I'd go elsewhere."
1,"Before moving to Tempe I never knew the glory of what is Mediterranean food and by association, what a Gyro was. I was young, naive, and greekless.\nNow I'm educated and occassionally find myself \""Goin' Out West\"" (Tom Waits anyone?) to visit, put in some face time and what not but I'm always struck with Gyro DT's since there are few places that have wised up and jumped on the Mediterranean flavor train.  \nThe Gyro's are massively fat, stacked, monsters of meat and onions.  Now It may be intimidating at first, like fighting a Goliath made of sweet succulent euphoria but  don't worry guy, they have to go boxes, if you can control yourself after the first bite.  Their rice is good too.  ( sorry rice no analogies for you)\nThe best thing though, is they have SRIRACHA SAUCE!!!!!  Now these Gyro's are at a ten but anyone who's had Sriracha (Capitalization for pure respect) knows it makes anything an immediate fucking eleven.\nFin."
0,"Terrible service. My husband and I came here about a month ago before seeing a show (we are locals). We had no consistent waiter/waitress. It was obviously shift change and no one could figure out who was waiting on our table. The apps took forever and we saw half of the order sitting under the heat lamps for ten minutes before it got brought to us. Just a bad experience over all. This past Saturday night we decided to give it another try. We thought we'd sit at the bar this time because we should definitely get better service there. Unfortunately, we picked the wrong side of the bar. The bartender completely ignored us for a good five minutes (no eye contact or anything) and one of the other bartenders from the other side asked if we had been helped yet and ended up getting us our beers. Then we were stuck with our guy again who took forever to take our order and was just non attentive. He was pretty enthralled in a conversation with a couple from Australia. I think he was crushing on the woman because she really tied up all of his attention while they were there. It's too bad because we will not be going back there ever again because of the lack of service that we received on both occasions."
0,"We had lunch on Saturday, they were celebrating Horny Halloween, but the crowd was gathered for college football. It took us a few minutes to be seated. We looked over the menu and got started with their pepper poppers. They looked unappealing, and they were very greasy. The pepper was very tough, when you tried to cut into it, the filling spilled out.\n\nNext, came our entrees the Big Bossman salad and the Bloomin' Onion burger. The burger is topped with cheese and fried, and then served with grilled onions, tomato and bacon. It was dry, dry, dry. How can that be? After the peppers the grease was too much to bear so I switched with my hubby a few bites in. The salad was wilted. It seemed like a bowl of mush. I was not a fan. The husband asked for their house cornbread muffins. The texture was off, but the flavor was decent, I liked addition of diced jalapeno. They were the highlight of the meal.\n\nService was average, and overall the place had an odd vibe. It's a great place to watch games, lots of nice TVs, but stick to drinks because the food is weak. PBR makes you think country, but much of the music was rock. I suppose it is a rock bar, but then they threw in pop like Katy Perry. Not sure how that fits. I'd say it has a bit of an identity crisis."
0,"The prices are very reasonable. But there's a reason for it. The sushi lacks, oh what is it, flavor?? I was caught off guard as when I came in I was welcomed with the awesome aroma of the teppanyaki.\n\nI'm a big sushi fan and was disappointed with the quality.  It might have been an off day and I'll have to go back and try but I ordered tuna, salmon and yellowtail.\n\nNice venue.  Great location.  Hopefully the next time will be better."
1,Hands down the best hotel I've stayed at in Vegas! The first time I stayed in the two bedrooms suite. They had given me the two story one but I did not like the layout and they quickly upgraded me to the single story two bedroom suite. The room had two separate rooms with the kitchen n living area in the middle and the rooms on opposite sides. One room had a king bed and a master bathroom and the other had two queen beds with a regular bathroom. There was also a third guest bathroom and the couch turned into a pull out bed. Great for a large party.\nMy second stay here was in a regular room that was still very spacious. Had a kitchen and living room as well as the king bed. \n\nThis hotel is very modern and extremely clean! Staff is very nice and helpful.
1,"It is what it is: A gay bar with great cheap drinks, approachable bartenders, and a generally small, but friendly crowd. Nothing extravagant or fancy, but that's what makes this place so great.\n\nThe clientele is largely comprised of middle-aged men grabbing a drink and mingling, which only adds to it's charm. I've always felt welcomed, despite how young and na\u00efve I look. Hell, even my girl friends dig this place.\n\n* I must add that if you're put off by the male body you shouldn't come here. A slideshow of semi to fully nude men grace their televisions throughout the bar on the regular."
1,Went here last night with coworkers.  Great happy hour prices.  Nice atmosphere.  Definitely a chill casual sports bar feel. Just got bar food but it was good.  Looking forward to going back for poker or trivia.
1,Really great place to load up on food. It's especially good if you're looking for a small change of pace from the regular types of chain restaurants that are so plentiful throughout America. \n\nFood was very good. You go through a buffet-style line and then give all of your ingredients to the grill masters who fry it up and hand it back to you. Pretty awesome. I recommend spending an extra $2 to get the unlimited trips. One could really so some damage with that much power. \n\nI'd go back anytime.
0,"$22 for a bowl of ramen on the strip? I get it, it's the strip and you pretty much pay a 100% mark up on everything. \n\nI went in expecting to have a hearty sized bowl of ramen. What came out was a shock to me. The noodle soup was served in a tiny rice/miso soup bowl. The taste was okay at best. That opinion was probably skewed by the size of the bowl, as one always eats with their eyes first. I really should have walked out, but I was so hungry. \n\nI left the dining establishment almost as hungry as when I walked in. I spoke to my server and someone I believe to have been the manager. All they did was apologize and sympathize about the portion and pricing. It would have been nice if they offered us something else to eat on the house. \n\nI might have understood if this restaurant was in a higher end resort, but it was at the Monte Carlo. You've been forewarned."
0,"I love working out at Pure Fitness Scottsdale. Everyone is always very helpful, and is willing to give advice when asked.\n\nOne thing I really enjoy, is my monthly re-program, where I meet with a trainer and see where I stand compared to the month before. \n\nIn the past year I have worked with several different trainers, and they have all been very knowledgeable. I am currently working out with Elizabeth and she is the best!!!\n\nThe class selection is decent, and I rarely miss the Tuesday night ab class.\n\nFor parents- they do have an on-site daycare, so you can bring your kids to the gym worry free.\n\n\nEdit: Since writing this review I have switched clubs. I no longer work-out at the Scottsdale club due to a change in staff. As I no longer workout here, and was not happy when I left. I am changing my rating. Nothing personal, but that is how I felt when I left."
0,"Given that this restaurant was 1/4 full on one of the busiest weekends (July 4) should have been a warning sign. We made reservations for 6:45 PM and were seated next to a table of 20 people with screaming kids (I am as mad with myself for not asking for another table as I am with the airhead hostess for seating us there). Given that there were more employees at the restaurant than patrons, I don't understand why the service was so poor. \n\nWhen we sat down they did the usual up-sell on bottled water (attention all restaurants -- this is getting ANNOYING) and we asked for \""tap water\"" and I ordered a prickly pear frozen Margarita no salt. What arrived was a Margarita WITH salt. Given there was straw I went ahead and started drinking it, but within 60 seconds the waiter came to prepare the \""table side guacamole\"" and he asked me if I liked the drink and I said it was OK but they went ahead and put salt on it. His response? \""OK\"" ... note to management, when either your bartender or waitstaff screw up should they not try to make amends? \n\nGiven that I've had \""table side guacamole\"" at much cheaper places, like El Torito Grill, I expected something more than bringing a bowl with all the ingredients and the waiter standing there mixing them --- no explanation of WHAT the ingredients were or if we wanted this or that in the guacamole --- so why say \""table side\"" when it might as well have been done in the kitchen? And to top it off I had to ask the waiter about the two hot sauces; e.g. what were they, were they hot or mild, etc. The guacamole was OK, not the best and it was EXTREMELY salty. My guest and I couldn't figure out why. \n\nMy guest ordered the Filet with Cheese enchiladas and I ordered the \""tres tacos\"". My tacos were probably an appetizer but I wasn't that hungry and quite honestly nothing on the menu looked that great. They also had an all-you-can-eat buffet for $29 but to my guest and myself it looked like a glorified taco bar (with a nasty looking roasted whole suckling pig in the middle -- I'm sorry, when I see something that could possibly be someones pet roasted whole on a platter it doesn't make my mouth water). \n\nMy three tacos were one pork which was so hot I had to take a Pepcid AC after the meal, a chicken taco that was quite good and a steak carnitas taco that was smothered in the sweetest tasting BBQ sauce I've ever had --- that one I skipped after the first bite. \n\nIn the meantime, table with all the brats (why do parents allow this?) kept getting louder, my guest's steak and enchiladas came. He ordered the steak medium rare and what came was somewhere between medium well and well done. The waiter was actually standing behind me when I saw my guest cut the steak in half and looked in shock at how well done it was. Before I could say \""send it back NOW\"" the waiter said, ohh, that looks well done to me. So he took it back but offered NOTHING given that I was done with my meal by the time the next steak came which was BLOODY RARE. My guest and I had headaches from the screaming children and just wanted to get the hell out of there so he ate most of the steak but left the most bloody rare pieces for the kitchen staff to see when the plates were returned to the kitchen. We waited forever for the check and the waiter didn't take anything off the bill or even offer a free desert. I left a 10% tip and will NEVER be back."
1,"I'm from Chicago originally, but I go to school in Madison and decided to finally find a salon in Madison that I could go to regularly. After looking reading many reviews on Yelp, I decided to give KODE a try, as their prices are not that steep and the reviews on Yelp were pretty good. I love that they do online booking, it is extremely convenient.\n\nI scheduled myself for a half head foil with Kelly Z. Now, I have naturally black hair, so coloring it always presents a challenge, but Kelly Z was definitely up for the challenge! Even though I didn't know what exactly I wanted, she was able to give me something that I really like. We ended up deciding on putting 3 colors in my hair, black, light brown, and blonde. The results were amazing! This is probably the best highlight job I've ever received. I also have very thick hair, which Kelly Z was able to handle. I felt a little bad because she ended up spending about 3.5 hours on my hair, but it was well worth it.\n\nI will definitely be going back to Kelly Z at KODE when I'm due to touch up my highlights."
0,"We went here to have brunch with a friend that was driving back to Nashville, TN following our meal.  We had reservations for 8 and while the food was decent, the customer service was horrendous.  Our checks were brought to us before our whole group finished our meals. Beyond that, the hostess came over and stood right by our table...paused long enough for us to look up...and said (rather loud and rudely), \""I need this table set up for 12.\""  We had been there an hour at this point. While I realize brunch is a busy time, I found this behavior unacceptable and will not be dining at this restaurant for this very reason."
0,"I ate here with my husband on a super hot night, so maybe I just did not find soupy hot red broth exciting.  The Chef was amazing and offered us a cool new view on how to prepare soup.  Otherwise, there was nothing exciting about our dinner.  It was a hot bowl of tomato soup with seafood and quite underseasoned if you ask me.  \n\nSorry Yelp but I just did not get this place nor the high reviews. \n\nMaybe I missed something."
0,"Not very Asian if you ask me.  The food was greasy and salty even for mall food. Most of it was soggy and the vegetables didn't even have a crunch or crisp to them. The 2 entr\u00e9e plate was not worth the $7.00 paid.  Even my kids did not want to eat it and they love Panda Express.  This place, however does not even come close in comparison. I'm sad that after the remodel, they did not return.  I will not eat here ever again.  If I wanted grease I should have gone to Church's Chicken a few spots over."
1,"Sadly, I missed dinner service here so a couple of associates and I grabbed a late-night dessert at this lovely Italian restaurant.\n\nWe were very impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. Although we chose to sit outside, the location proved to be very hidden and private-- perfect spot to take your date! Our server was perfect and extremely attentive. Even though he knew we were only ordering desserts, he still took the time to go through their best options. We decided to go with a couple glasses of wine, some coffee, and a Tiramisu to share. The attention on our table was never lost, in fact, as the night grew chilly, our server came back and helped move a heat lamp closer to our table to keep warm.\n\nThe Tiramisu was excellent and I'm truly sorry to say I wasn't able to experience more of their great food! Will definitely be back on the next trip!"
0,So I have been here a few times. I am not crazy about bad reviews but I couldn't even eat my lunch the last time I went. Its always just one thing that is not good BUT that one thing is enough to give me a reason to stick with my Taco Trucks for a while. Sometimes its the soggy chips. Sometimes the salsa tastes like marinara sauce. It's just not my cup of tea. The service is good. The beer specials are good. I just need to break from the disappointment for a bit. I will go it again in a few months I'm sure as it is close to my office. In the meantime I need to brush up on my spanish - no one at the Taco Truck on South Blvd speaks english!
1,"I've had pho two times and it has been good, much better than last year. Don't forgot to take advantage of the yelp checkin for free egg rolls. \n\nAlso got the crispy wings and dumplings which were served lukewarm but the flavour was still good. Took so long for the dumplings to come out we couldn't be bothered sending it back. \n\nHad the same young server both times and it was only his 2nd day the first time and he improved slightly a week later. Tried the Korean BBQ charbroiled ribs and they were tasty! Definitely getting that one again! \n\nWill I be back? Most definitely."
0,"Apparently being the correct demographic for this place, I recd a coupon for a free drink in the mail. Coupons are always challenging for staff to treat graciously. So a fair test for trying a new place. They failed miserably though the Rickard's white I had was nice."
0,Well two days later and I am still sick from food poisoning.  I came from all the positive reviews  as I have just moved from Hawaii. It was the last meal I have had in three days.  I had #12 with added beef balls.  All my sides looked recycled and soup had a strong lime taste.  Needless to say I will not be back.
0,"I can handle the the fact the place is run down, smelled of cigarettes and is a adult orientated business, heck I choose to go there \""check it out\"" but, I do expect some customer service. I stopped in in the middle of the day and didn't even get a hello from the clerk. I browsed around looked at the various items all while the clerk watched. He then went back towards the Peep show area when lunch for one the dancers arrived. Seeing that costumers where invisible to the staff I left. There are much better and more friendly places in the Las Vegas area to go."
0,"Went today to order wings and fries for 8.99 (12 wings and about 10 little fries) \nover cooked dried out nasty food....the fries weren't even a handful. I tried to chat up a confo and be cool.but that lady at the counter has NO Customer Service Skills at all. The cooks suck. and I just took my money back,and never ever will be back. At first I thought okay word of mouth is everything,but after paying,and receiving my food with a no smile attitude woman forget it!!!!\nI hope you go down!!!!"
0,"Why is that Everytime I go in here the people behind the counter are RUDE! Just because you know exactly how to ship something or understand the workings of a  post office doesn't mean everyone else does too! Please, if you don't like working with people everyday, quit your job! My tax payer dollars don't need to pay rude people!"
1,"This was one of those times where I walked out, defiantly, thinking I WILL NOT BE JUDGED. Yet later on, when the SR asked me, where was mine? I had to hang my head in shame. For I, yer honour, I did walk past, and it was like a magnet pulling me in, for I did indeed see me some delightful looking almond croissants. \n\nLet me take you back to a time when once I feasted on almond croissants, in the balmy summer of the South of France. I've never tasted anything like those croissants in all my days since I left that town, not that I have ever stopped trying. Every one I have tried has paled in comparison, dry, dusty, overly sweet, not butterly melt in the almondy mouth. I'm not going to lie - The Wee Boulangerie didn't succeed either, but it gave it a damn good try. Where most almond croissants are almond paste basted in the heart of a pastry fold, and carry the body of a normal looking croissant, The Wee Boulangerie was like a Picasso impression, with crispy almond sponge oozing out everywhere. It didn't even really look like a croissant. But it tasted light, not dry, not too sweet, and the crispy light edges made a delightful contrast to the heaviness of the croissant itself. I enjoyed every, single, mouthful. \n\nA note as well - I'm on a diet. Almond croissants are pretty much verboten. The SR is on a diet. He is sick with jealousy at my hedonism... I'm going to have to get more to appease him. Thanks The Wee Boulangerie, you destroyed my diet, but in oh so such a beautiful way...."
0,"Very salesy and pushy IMHO\n\nI arrived with the intent purpose of test driving a vehicle. I was very upfront with the salesman when I arrived. I told him I was interested in a certain line of luxury vehicles and wanted to test drive cars in a particular class. I told him I wasn't buying today and wanted to make an informed decision. I showed him my 90K Mercedes outside to show I was a credible client and not someone just wasting his time.  I told them my intent was not to buy today because I wanted to test drive the Audi, Mercedes, Lexus etc before buying. Even after telling him this, he sat me down on a couch. He asked me a lot of unnecessary questions despite knowing I was there to test drive a car. When I test drove the car, the salesman was very condescending. I look young so I assumed he thought I was a kid in my early 20's  even though I'm in my late 30's and a professional. He was a back seat driver and was directing me turn by turn. After the drive, he didn't drop me off at the showroom. I had to ride with him back into the garage where he applied more pressure sales tactics. He then re-asked many of the same questions he had already asked. He asked them in different ways and assumed I was an idiot and didn't recognize his cheap tactic. We then stopped on the second floor so I could \""use the bathroom.\"" His desk is on the showroom floor which is the first floor. They stop on the second floor to further delay you and engage you in further conversation. Then we took the elevator down to the first floor. He then walks me past his desk to re-ask the same questions he had been asking me all day. This was essentially their last ditch effort to see if I would purchase a car from them. The salesman even mocked his own tactics. He said \""The chances of you returning are about 30% when you leave the door so what can we do to sell you a car now.\""  When I asked about pricing, the salesman said he doesn't know anything about numbers and that pricing was done by \""them.\""  I gathered he just shows you the vehicle and they bring in a closer to work the deal. This is pretty typical of most dealerships. The salesman is the \""good cop\"" and the closer is the \""bad cop.\""  I eventually left the dealership but not after wasting an additional 30 minutes of babysitting a salesman who thought he was being clever in applying these tactics. I expect this at a GM dealership but was very surprised to witness this at a premium luxury dealership. \n\nI test drove  cars at Mercedes and Audi across the street. None of their sales representatives were as pushy as the Chapman BMW reps. None of them called me after my test drive. They were intelligent enough to recognize that if I was interested in buying a car from them, I would call them. Just from the pushy and overzealous sales tactics, I would never buy a BMW here. I would rather buy a BMW from another state and ship it than do business here. I just got a very bad vibe from this place. I would encourage the sales manager to not encourage aggressive and pushy sales tactics because most of us who can afford BMW's are professionals and don't appreciate those types of tactics. We are buying a BMW not a Chevy. Act like it!"
1,"My family and I went here for one of their Christmas Eve Candlelight Services. They offered 2, 3:30, and 5:30pm services. \n\nEveryone who greeted us were very friendly! The chapel area was very large and spacious. They have a coffee shop and seating area, which is a nice touch. \n\nThe program was uplifting and well organized. I enjoyed their use of various media to keep the audience engaged."
1,"Great neighborhood spot. I was pleasantly surprised going in the place, it was very upscale and nice inside, without being stuffy. Kind of a lounge feel. Food was pretty good, there were a few hiccups, but they had just opened. I look forward to trying it again, as SoSco needs more great indie spots.\n\nSupport small business!"
0,"This place sucks. It's McDonald's plus 30% price increase.  Want a good burger,  plenty of other places around."
1,I have been using C&R Tire for all my cars - 6 - for many years.  I usually go to the Tatum & Bell location.  Ralph and his team are very professional and have always done exceptional work at a very fair price.  I highly recommend them!
0,"Not a female friendly bar. Seriously lacking in customer service skills, a few of the female bartenders are just downright RUDE. The food is good, but sad the experience is ruined by unfriendly, unprofessional bar staff."
1,"I have had the pleasure of working with the staff at this Enterprise location a few times over the last year and have been treated great!  Staff is friendly, polite, and honest.  They listened to my preference in a vehicle and worked with what was available to meet my needs.  Never was there a question of the condition of the vehicle since they do a thorough check before the vehicle leaves their lot.  I'm happy Enterprise is close to my Goodyear home and will definitely use them again!"
0,We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.\n\nWe will never return.
0,"This place is truly terrible, spent an hour waiting for my food, saw my server once. Food was brought to the wrong tables twice, baked potato tasted terrible. I would have paid to not eat there. Ruined my overall mood for the night, prime rib almost made me hurl.  Avoid this place, I would give anywhere else in the casino a try, it couldn't possibly be worse."
0,"I went to this place thinking I could get a good hair cut, but I was wrong. The hair stylist was friendly, I showed her a picture of how I wanted my hair and for the most part it was going well. Until she cut my bangs, she cut off way too much from the side and now I look like I'm back in elementary school. Then when it came to paying, I tried to use my credit card but they didn't even have a working machine. I was very disappointed in this place."
0,I have never been so disappointed in an oil change! First they took my car and told me they would contact me when it was ready so I was free to do some shopping in Costco next door.  They never called.  I walked back over to pick up my car to find they never touched it and refused to work on it.  They said they heard a noise in the engine and would not tell me what it was.  (I had it checked out at different place).  Sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment.  All that was wrong was the O2 sensor was broken (nothing to cause and engine to blow up).  These guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work.  They chose to scare me instead.  I will never go back to a Sears Auto Center for anything.
0,"Well i was in the restaurant on whats called \""Unlimited RFB\"" Which means my room, food and beverage is comped ie. free, for two people and yet still I feel i overpaid.\n\nService was insanely slow. After 75 minutes I just asked for the check so I could leave. Theres more drama but I just posted on TA do id rather not relive it. Service was awful.. food was eh, of what we had, The entrees never made it. \n\nYou should only speak good of people...its closing: GOOD"
1,"Probably one of the yummiest dinners that I ever had. Service was a little neglectful at times, despite the open tables. I give it an excellent rating because the food and atmosphere was great!"
1,"They do make amazing chicken strips, I must say. I wrap em in the Texas toast, than dip em in their sauce. The fries are just ok. They're like Chinese food fries here in NY. Thick, crinkle cut. No me gusta. Oh, the ice tea. Its crack! In a good way. Get the sweetened ice tea. If your eating fried chicken & fries, u might as well get the sweat tea. This place is perfect for kids. Straight up child menu.  Chicken strips, baby!"
0,"I've purchased wood here for years, and recommended this business to friends.  But today, I pulled up to purchase a couple bags of wood, and the employee who was supposed to be selling me the wood took a look at my \""Obama 2012\"" bumber sticker, took a few steps back, and then said sarcastically \""well, i GUESS I will still help you, even though you voted for Obama\"".   Not only was this rude, but none of your business.  You are in the business of selling wood, and I guess also you are in the business of trying to insult your customers.  Sour grapes cause your candidate lost the election? Keep that to yourself, Sir, and just load the wood in my car.  Rude.  Poor customer service. Inappropriate."
0,Wow.... bad review to follow once I get home.  20hr Nope.  15$ for 1/2hr foot massage for my girl and $15 for 1/2hr. hand massage for me said the guy at the front. Then... I get to the back and after 5min of feet soaking and they say 25$ for 30$ min hand massage and then they say $35 for 30min hand massage!  Wtf.  We got up and left.  SHADY SHADY SHADY.
0,"Well it is a savers\nI only went because i had things to drop off. But i checked it out for the little bit to fine some dazzling shirt or something. I liked the idea of walking down the aisles with low income families, punk rock teenagers and the uh working class woman in her forties checking out for the hottest threads in leopard, sparkly pink and lime green. I wish i was joking about this lady, put she had to get in front of me so i wouldn't pick up the shirts that totally belong to her. Well... I'm not a animal print girl. So she was safe. \nAs for bargain shopping eh.. i've been to better places."
1,"I've read some mixed reviews about this place so I wanted to try it for myself. K & I decided to try their lunch offer. 2 course lunch & a cocktail for \u00a315 through 5pm.co.uk. We both had the pink gin fizz cocktail which was lovely. It was a generous serving in a tall glass with fresh raspberries muddled through it. So good we ordered a second!\nFood wise, I had the mussels in a Bloody Mary sauce to start. It was a generous serving of very plump mussels with some crusty bread to mop up the sauce. K had the bruschetta. It was a generous portion too & we scoffed the lot. For main I tried the salmon served with herb couscous & K had the chicken stuffed with haggis. Both portions were a decent size & full of flavour. I'd definitely go back. \nThe service was good too. We were through in the restaurant rather than the bar area so next time I'll try the bar & see how it compares."
1,"Hubs and I wanted to try Fleur when it was Fleur de Lys, but we missed our chance. So, Restaurant.com certificate in hand, Hubs and I decided to try this new \""tapas\"" version of Fleur in November 2011.\n\nWe sat out on the \""patio\"" of the restaurant (patio meaning it was along the indoor avenue of Mandalay Bay). Great people watching.\n\nWe sprang for some sparkling wine with our tapas, which was pricey but complimented our snacks. We enjoyed the marinated olives (pretty much what you would expect) and the burrata, which was excellent. I didn't want it to end. Lovely texture and flavor.\n\nThe waitress was a little snobby and didn't seem to stoked on our restaurant.com certificate but I don't really understand the attitude since the certificate stipulates that 18% gratuity will be added to the bill automatically. So, regardless of her concern over our \""cheapness,\"" she would receive at least 18% gratuity.\n\nAnd believe me, this isn't cheap! Bill was $72 without tip and gratuity and before our restaurant.com certificate.\n\nAnd, just a small rant that isn't Fleur's fault: \n\nThere was a small girl hanging on the short railing along the patio...inches away from our food. Staring at us, breathing on our food...and the parents said NOTHING! For about five minutes this goes on! Seriously, control your kid. Keep them away from people who are dining. It almost ruined the afternoon with my frustration over the lack of discipline and respect the parents had.\n\nBottom Line: Fleur is a nice spot for some people watching, tasty drinks, and delightful snacks...just watch out for inattentive parents..."
0,"I've tried this place once before..had d Gyro with d white sauce added top of d meat. 2nd time the meat was bland, sauce on d side. Driving off d Hwy I've seen their big poster advertising their Gyro with the white sauce on top..coming from NY where I've had n enjoy Gyro sandwiches all d time the sauce is on top of meat along with all the only stuff that goes with d sandwich..Why on d side? I won't b eating at this place ever again..can't get past d bland tasting meat..sauce on d side no big deal..But..why not b authentic n add it to d sandwich the way it shld b done..I guess I of cld told them to add d sauce onto d sandwich lik it was done w/d first Gyro sandwich I ever had there. Taking it to go d 2nd time it was on d side..took a taste of d sauce-less meat..it had no flavor...really bland..it needs that sauce big time..Will I go back? Nope..looking for a new n better tasting Gyro place.."
1,"My boyfriend and I dined for lunch at My Buddy's Cafe and the food was outstanding! The service was very friendly and the Gyros were great!  $5.00 for a Gyro, can't beat that!  We will be back for sure!"
0,Worst coffee I've ever had in my life. I asked for an iced decaf coffee and what I reviewed was extremely watered down and not appetizing in the least. Also their sugar cookie tasted like chalk.
1,"Visites last night and it was superb.  Best sushi, great food and great personnel including all.  I'll come back next time I visit Montreal."
1,"Went in on a Tuesday night around 9pm and had very prompt service. The hostess was very welcoming and the server (Clay) was very friendly & gave excellent recommendations. I've never had a tomato sauce based ceviche before, but it tasted pretty good! The guacamole appetizer had a savory taste as well. There is an extensive drink menu, and I must say that I am a fan of Mango Mojitos."
1,"Anyone who knows me knows that I'm not one for strip clubs. However, if more were like my night here, than I might change my mind.\n\nNo pressure, relaxed atmosphere, in a very nice looking (and clean) venue!\n\nBest part of the night? A 400 lb. (at least) man being brought on stage by a bunch of dancers and they slowly took all his clothes off down to his underwear. Probably the best night of that guys life next to his wedding (he was the bachelor).\n\nThe guy was a real champ! It made for an awesome show!"
0,"The setup at foodie fest is not good. I had a \""VIP\"" pass to get into the blocked off VIP area, \""the red dragon lounge\"" or something of this nature? The VIP was the worst section of the whole festival. Lines were outrageous and only one dish tasted decent, the only good thing was free drinks but for how long you wait in line you can't get a ton of drinks anyway. \n\nThe rest of the festival was confusing. Some of the booths and trucks are so far spread out that it feels empty. I like a few of the trucks there, but I would much rather follow them on twitter and go to where they are than pay to get into foodie fest to pay again to eat at a food truck. \n\nThe only place I haven't had that I really wanted to try was sushi burrito and their line was literally 50 people deep which was not worth it to me. \n\nOverall, a very boring night and I didn't even leave full."
1,"Eddie and everyone is always friendly and ALWAYS does a great job when I go there. I love to get the old fashioned shaves with my haircut, because they use a hot towel and warm shave cream... I would defiantly recommend them to every one in the area looking for  a haircut, shave to even eyebrows in a very nice shop with very nice people"
1,"Second time here, first time wasn't super impressed but I think it's because we were comparing it to Hot n Juicys. If you want a trifeca sauce, I'd recommend HNJ... the trifeca sauce here is a little too oily and not juicy at all so it doesn't penetrate the shells. However this time we went with the waiters suggestion... PACIFIC RIM sauce. OH SO YUMMY! that was so delicious... Highly recommend"
1,"this is a newer, cleaner location.\n\ntheir agua frescas are very good. get the cheese crisp! delicious simplicity!\n\nfree chips and salsa if you dine inside!"
0,"This place is uber hipster with great quality coffee but I have to give it marks off for charging $1 for breve milk in my latte and they don't use Straus Organic for the half/half. They used Ultra pasteurized Horizon which made the drink taste weak sauce. \n\nWhy exactly are they charging the customer way too much for cheaper quality milk?? Any coffee lover knows if you're not having straight espresso, the milk/dairy is a huge part of the experience.... Needless to say, the barista wasn't willing to fix my drink when I showed my displeasure in. \nGoing to think twice the next time I choose a place and willing to pay $5 for a latte."
0,"I'll have to defer to the folks who think the $20.13 deal for lunch is a good one.  I'm sure it is and I'll might try it the next time I'm in Vegas.   And if I was on an expense account or, as I assume from what I could observe of many of my fellow patrons when we were there, using my daddy's (or my sugar daddy's) credit card, a lavish, no holds barred dinner here would be a pleasant way to spend an evening without a care in the world,  Service that we had sitting at the bar was very professional, but I'm cutting them some slack for gently pushing the purchase of the restaurant's olive oil (a touch tacky, I think).\n\nThe problem is that the price of the dishes in the evening, given what you receive, is way out of line with the value.  Now,  I'd guess that many of my fellow patrons could give a flying fig about dollar value, but that's not how I roll.  I can justify dropping many hundreds of dollars for a meal for two on occasion if I was presented with dish after dish with double plus wow factor.  Here though, we're talking about relatively simple Mediterranean cuisine centered on Greek cooking.   I love that stuff big time, as it is the food that launched the cultures of the Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the southern Spanish and French.  But no matter how much effort goes into sourcing the best or freshest this or that, at the end of the day you're dealing with a few ingredients cooked in a straightforward manner, maybe a couple of minutes on a grill, steamed to get just beyond raw, or pasta\\rice tossed in boiling water just long enough to still have a little tooth to it.  Simple food from a land that is relatively poor.\n\nThat's why I have to give Milos a 2 star based on our single visit just sampling the appetizer selections: this is simple food that is insanely expensive, albeit clearly involving good ingredients.  I can't give you exact prices (the menu on their website is outdated) but here is an example.  We ordered the grilled sardines.  This dish, a staple of the impoverished fishing villages of Portugal that involves simply brushing on a little olive oil and salt and tossing on a BBQ, was something like $22.  For that amount of money we received all of....four small sardines.  If the Greeks got over $5 for a fish the size of your index finger, they wouldn't be in a financial crisis right now.  The bottarga (grey mullet roe) was nearly $30, but turned out to be four tiny crackers with a sliver, and I mean a sliver, of cured roe.  The grilled octopus was very tasty, and the portion size we received was enough for two folks for sure, but at close to $30 the value simply wasn't there.  And perhaps the worst offender was the least expensive: the taramosalata was so bland and un-fish-like that we initially thought they had served us an order of hummus.  Even if it was under $10, and it certainly wasn't (maybe closer to $20), it wasn't worth what we had paid.\n\nI guess I'm just cranky though, because the place was packed with folks ordering the $300 grouper and thinking nothing about dropping $65 for a couple of lamb chops.  For me though, I'll save my money and spend it at a true Mediterranean restaurant that gives you decent bang for the buck.  \n\nNick in Palm Springs\n\nP.S.: How can a restaurant named \""Estiatorio Milos\"" offer only a single variety of Ouzo?  The Greeks of the world would be outraged by this travesty!"
1,I love copperstar! Great staff and pleasant atmosphere. Wish they would have the roll-up door open more often and had a better selection of pastries in the afternoon an evening but its still pretty tasty! \n\nMy favorite drink is the Coconut Latte with a half pump of chocolate syrup. it's great hot and cold!
1,Very yummy fro-yo! SO MANY TOPPINGS!  I will definitely be back!
0,"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon during the college football games.  Place was very crowded which is a good thing.  I ordered a Camelback IPA, a local IPA recommended by the bartender.  I use the term bartender loosely, all the beautiful young girls in barely nothing T-shirts remind me of Hooters.  The beer was barely drinkable.  I tried the Arizona burger.  If I weren't starving I would not have been able to eat it.  If you're looking for a good burger and a beer as this place's name suggest, I would go somewhere else."
1,"I HEART SERGIOS\n\nThis is my kind of place, I mean its so LOW KEY.  If you are not paying attention, you will miss it. Francisco is always there and knows the definition of SERVICE.  Authentic Italian classics all over the menu.... I dont have a favorite dish here.  EVERYTHING IS GOOD.  However it usually goes down like this...\n\nI walk in, Francisco gives me the BEST greeting, i sit down & a glass of PINOT NOIR follows, and its always full if you know what i mean.  I order soup Pasta fagioli or the Italian wedding, whatever feels right that day, then i have a ceaser side salad, then some pasta LIQUINI with Clams is probably what I order the most! \n\nI HEART SERGIOS :)"
1,"Absolutely delicious food! Today was my first time at Nola today, and I will definitely go again. I had the Grilled Chicken Panini with the fries. The fries were incredibly good! The panini was yum too. \n\nThe only problem with this place is that the service is ridiculously slow. It has been a while since I waited 30 minutes after I ordered to have my food served. I don`t know if it is because it was a lunch time during a weekday, or if it is their usual routine. But I would recommend carving time on your calendar longer than the usual if you would like to go this place during the week and sit down to enjoy your lunch. \n\nHighly recommend it - will try the drinks next time which I heard are also really good!"

0,"Rund um den Philong sieht man sie. Nudelesser mit kleinen Pappschachteln, aber meist ohne St\u00e4bchen.

1,"Recently, I have been to several major US cities, and in each one, I made it a point to find the best sushi I could, with varying degrees of success.  One of my friends asked me, \""Why haven't you found the best sushi in Phoenix?\""  Lack of urgency?  Needless to say, we began a quest to find the best sushi in Phoenix.  It will be an expensive quest.  And I think we started at the right place.\n\nWe started with the miso soup with clams.  If you want to imagine what miso soup with clam tastes like, imagine taking miso soup, and just adding clams.  I can't really think of any other way to describe it.  It's really that simple.\n\nWhen the waitress took our order, we basically just went to town.  And everything was brought out, for the most part, one at a time.  This gave us time to enjoy each dish, and have a few minutes to think about it before the next item arrived.\n\nThe first dish we had was the ankimo, or steamed monkfish liver.  This delicacy is something I had in Denver, San Diego, and San Francisco.  Here, it was served without ponzu jelly, but otherwise similar.  The others in my party, who hadn't had ankimo before, liked it.\n\nNext, we had hamachi carpaccio, which was a hit.  These perfectly garnished strips of yellowtail were one of the highlights of the night.\n\nAfter that, we had yellowtail tartare.  This got mixed reactions; I'm not sure what they used in the flavoring, but I did like the spicy note that slowly builds up after you eat it.\n\nWe then had the amaebi sushi (shrimp), which was served in two stages: first, the main part of the body, peeled and raw; and finally, the head, deep-fried.  I had deep fried shrimp heads before, but it was a first for my two dining companions.  Really, the head is the most interesting part, and I would highly recommend anybody eating shrimp sushi to go ahead and ask for the fried head.\n\nNext was brought out a whole fried european sea bass.  This was one of the most passable items for me; I usually prefer my fish to be served raw.  It was a nice change from everything else, but I probably won't order that one again... Or maybe I'm just bitter because the fish only had two eyeballs, and I didn't get one of them.\n\nWe then started on a rainbow roll, which the others ordered because they wanted to ensure we had something \""safe.\""  I ate a few pieces, but I never really get excited about rainbow rolls, or really any rolls.\n\nNext they brought out the sushi: we had ocean trout, young yellowtail, and red snapper.  The waitress made sure to mention that they were served with garnishes and sauces, and were not meant to be dipped in additional sauce.  I liked that they were so serious about how the dishes are intended to be eaten; it really highlights the care they take in making the cuisine an actual art form, and not just something to stuff your face with.  My favorite of the three fish was the young yellowtail, but all were good (and fresh).\n\nAfterwards, we had one more sushi item: the foie gras sushi.  It's really difficult to describe the taste of foie gras; it is distinct, but not overwhelming.  It was delicious, and making sushi out of it is an interesting concept.\n\nFor our last dish, we had the cook make us something of his choice.  He personally brought it to the table, and explained what it was.  He made us avocado tempura wrapped in see eel, with foie gras on top.  As if the meal wasn't already awesome enough, this totally elevated it to a new level.  It may make me a snob, but there's nothing I like more than having a piece of art made just for me, and having the artist personally unravel it.  If you have any appreciation of cuisine as an art form, this is clearly the place for you.\n\nWe finished our meal with the UFO dessert, which is a disc-shaped pastry stuffed with red bean and battered in tempura, and topped with ice cream.  It was pretty good.\n\nNow, I have had some pretty good meals in my life, but if I were look back and consider which one was the very best, this one would definitely merit consideration.  It may not appeal to the fan of generic sushi rolls, but if you like trying new and interesting things, you're sure to find some potential here.  The quality of the food and of the menu is second to none, as far as sushi restaurants are concerned."
1,"Whenever I have a friend in from out of town I take them here. Visually the restaurant is really attractive and feels comfortable. The people watching is fun and it's near fantastic shopping. Anything I've ever ordered here has been really great.  The 'cafe' in the front is good too, if you're in a hurry...even for breakfast."
1,"i love this place and their food!\nwhat i mainly love is that their prices are extremely reasonable now so i can go more often.\ntheir steaks are very good as are their ribs and chicken\nas for appetizers, i love the signature Bloomin' onion and i recently tried their wings and i love them! it must be the seasonings and sauce\nthey taste very different.\nand the service is alway excellent \nbut when you do plan on going, make a reservation to avoid waiting too horribly long"
0,"I just don't get what people like about this place.  I am not a pittsburgh native, but shortly after moving to squirrel hill I had three out-of-state friends come visit and so I decided to try out the famous Mineo's pizza I had heard so much about.\n\nWe all ate a slice or two with no one commenting on the pizza, until finally, one person said what had been on all of our minds: \""hey, this isn't very good\"".  We all agreed, and we didn't even finish the pizza.  Just too much cheese and an overall low-quality taste.\n\nMaybe we got a bad batch, I don't know, but I was completely unimpressed by this Pittsburgh legend.  On another note, one of my friends really likes to go there for a late night ice cream."
1,"I really enjoy this pizza. Crisp, yet chewy crust, fresh tasting toppings, and real cheese oozing hot from the oven. The meats seem very real and less processed then other pizza joints, so don't order  pepperoni and expect it to be a dry, healthful pizza. It's going to be lusciously moist and slightly greasy. Their sausage &  pepperoni Sicilian takes a little while longer to make, but showcases the quality if their crust even better than the original. \n\nIf I had kids, I would totally buy their \""year's worth of pizza\"" deal and make every Friday night dinner pizza night. I like it that much -- eating it once a week would be completely ok with me. Alas, I have no kids and am generally drinking somewhere on Fridays. I've only been there late at night, so I've yet to encounter the hordes of children said to down the dining room each evening. However, their bar staff is friendly and their beer pours are on point."
0,"Stay FAR AWAY from this place.  Complete scammers.  My girlfriend brought here car in with a slow starting problem and said she thought it may be the starter.  Without running the simple diagnostic on it to confirm this was the problem, they replaced a perfectly good starter ($550 with labor)--it was only then that they proceeded to tell her that the battery was the real problem.  I asked the manager afterwards why they would not check the starter (which literally takes 5 seconds) and said he just does what the customer asks for and was obviously unwilling to refund any portion of the unnecessary work.  So unless you (or your wife, daughter, etc) are a licensed mechanic, do not use this garage.\n\nCOMPLETE AND TOTAL SCAM ARTISTS.  You would be better off taking your vehicle literally anywhere else."
0,Went with a large group on a Friday evening. The group reserved the entire back area so we could be together. The restaurant only had two people assigned our area (we had at least 100 people and over 15 tables). We personally waited 15 minutes just to get our drink order then we placed our food order and waited well over an hour for our food. By the time we received our food several of the tables in our group decided to leave and go to the Cook Out to get better service and actually have their dinner after finding out that the order they had placed over an hour earlier hadn't even been started yet in the kitchen!!! The management knew we were coming well in advance yet chose to schedule a light staff in the dining room and in the kitchen. The food was mediocre at best and I only gave it one star because zero stars was not an option.
0,"Yelp! Say it ain't so! You've led me astray! With an almost 5 star rating, I was expecting some bomb ass Mexican food. If it weren't for the kindness and customer service skills of the general manager, I would have given El Dorado's 1 star. We came on Monday around 7PM, on locals night. As many others have attested, this restaurant is kind of hard to find. Parking was extremely crowded (Sapphire's must be a popular strip club). My husband eventually spotted the entrance and we walked right in. We were seated immediately and our waiter greeted us in no time. So far, so good, right? \n\nWe were automatically given two glasses of water and chips and salsa. The water tasted gross and dirty. After one sip, I pushed it to the side. The chips and salsa were okay. The waiter recommended some kind of fruit infused water and then walked away. Hey, what about my drink order? I grew thirstier and thirstier after munching on chips and salsa while waiting on our waiter to come back. Finally, he returned and instead of taking our drink order, asks if we've decided on what to eat. Fine. I ordered the cheese enchiladas ($9.50), with a Coke please. My husband ordered Steak al Cilantro ($26.50). \n\nThe food came out pretty quickly, but the visual presentation for both our entrees was seriously lacking. The cheese on my enchiladas looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The red sauce looked and tasted like it came from a can. I am a mediocre cook at best, and I could have made better enchiladas.The rice was bland and flavorless and was NOT Mexican rice by my standards. The refried beans tasted too meaty. The enchiladas were lackluster but I ate them anyways. Sigh.     \n\nMy poor husband's steak looked like slop. According to the menu, the steak was \""topped\"" with green tomatillo sauce. My ass. That shit was drenched in it. My husband said all he could taste was that sauce. Other words he used to describe his meal were \""worst steak in my life\"" and \""the first bite was pure fat that I chewed for 5 minutes\"". Needless to say, he sent it back. \n\nOur waiter had gone MIA and never bothered to check on us after dropping off the food. The general manager is the one who actually checked on us and sent back the plate. She was totally cool about the whole thing. She recommended  the Cochinita pork tacos ($9.50), so he went with that. \n\nIn the meantime, we were also waiting on refills. The waiter was still missing. When the GM returned with the pork tacos, we asked HER if we could get refills. My husband said the pork tacos were just okay.  \n\nAt this point, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The waiter with the disappearing act returned to clear our plates and get us our check. The final bill was a shockingly low $12.97, but that's still overpriced if I don't like the food. The manager was a sweetheart and gave me her card to let her know if I would be coming in again and if I had any comments for her. While I appreciate this gesture, we will not be returning. The food and service (the waiter) were plain bad. I was also disappointed in the so-called plethora of vegetarian options I read about in reviews. El Dorado's has the same options as any other Mexican restaurant, so don't get your hopes up."
1,"he's technically closed for the season, but after a phone call, he will let you peruse on appointment. \n\ni am absolutely flabbergasted by Shamus' skills. he literally grows tropicals...and they thrive!!! without much water, without a ton of humidity...who knew? i only assumed that none of his plants would live a month in AZ. i've eaten nearly everyone of the tropical fruits he grows....but only in places like laos, thailand, guyana, chile....basically anywhere but here! and i just still can't get over how he grows them with ease!\n\nhe does have a day job, so this is not like a nursery per se. it's his house and yard, so it's best to follow him on facebook for updates and times. he doesn't sell lantana or prickly pear or really anything desert related (or anything under 20 bucks, but you also pay for the expertise). what you will find are...pineapple, mango, passion fruit, guava, breadfruit, dragon fruit, lychee, banana, suriname cherry, and any other kind of tropicals. \n\nShamus gave me excellent planting, growing, and caretaking tips to ensure the mango tree i bought today would actually live. he also advised me on some of the other tropicals i have (pineapple, and plumeria) that don't really seem to do anything. i'm re-invigorated to start up the tropicals with better success this time. \n\ncash only and call him first...like i said, it's his home, not a retail nursery."

1,"Everyone on the east coast has heard of In-N-Out or Jack in the Box. Its lesser known sibling Fatburger is worthy of recognition, however. A friend of mine hates In-N-Out and swears that Fatburger is the best, so he took us here. He pointed out their seasoned patty. Yum.... \n\nSo the next time I ate at In-N-Out, I remembered the seasoned patty at Fatburger. Hm... I think I like them both equally. But I gotta admit, the Fatburger was pretty delicious. \n\nOn the burger scale, it is as follows:\n1. Custom Burger by Pat LaFrieda (still and probably forever #1)\n2. 5 Guys\n3. In-N-Out / Fatburger (tied)\n4. Jack in the Box"
1,"The staff here is VERY friendly! It's always a pleasure to hear them say, \""My pleasure!\"" Restaurant is always clean and the decor has a new-age style. Food is ALWAYS amazing! One time I ordered extra pickles on my number one and they didn't give me extra pickles. I called the store and spoke to management. They apologized and offered to send me coupons in the mail for my troubles. I received those coupons within a week with a hand written letter from John, the office supervisor, apologizing for forgetting the extra pickles. I was blown away by their excellent customer service! I will definitely return in the near future!"
0,"Bleah!!!  I went here because I was staying at the Westin across the street.  We had about 12 people for dinner.  The decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired.  I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie, but then came the food.  I ordered a  chicken breast that was supposed to come with hushpuppy breaded shrimp and some type of ravioli.  The food came out at different times which left some of our food getting cold.  When my chicken showed up it appeared to be boiled and had some really bad sauce on it that I can't explain.  It was pretty unedible after a couple of bites.  Also the shrimp came  butterflied and sauteed(?) definatly not as described on the menu.   All in all I would skip this place, the food is bad, one star for the decour and wine list , but they even managed to screw up the wine order."
0,"Atrocious service. My trip here led to a shouting match with the manager. We purchased a groupon for a party of four. The other couple cancelled, and the restaurant manager refused to honor the groupon, even though it would have resulted in us spending more money than we would have.\n\nApparently they are all good on cash here, so don't bother giving them any of yours. Never had a worse dining, or in this case a \""not-dining\"" experience in my life. \n\nCan't wait to see this place turned into more parking lot. Their terrible management is going to make that happen sooner than later."
1,"We went to the grind.  Love the interior design, very slick and modern.\n\nThe staff was fantastic.  Super friendly and helpful.\n\nWe split a mushroom burger and fries and a salad.   The burger was PHENOMENAL!  Huge (perfect for splitting) and yummy.  So were the fries.  The salad was good.\n\nPrices were medium...and affordable.  Happy hour prices were not very drastic compared to others.\n\nMy only critique is that they are set up to be a \""sports bar\"".  So you have 8 televisions showing sports....and then the ambience is ruined by BLASTING sports commentary and of course the obnoxious sports related  commercials.\n\nSo, if the sports bar thing is your bag...you will be in heaven.\n\nNot my cup o' tea however.  They did turn it down so we could at least hear each others conversation....thankfully.  Next time.....maybe take out."
1,"What a great show. \n\nI went to see this about 3 months ago with my 2 roommates/best friends, and one's Mom.  \n\nI'll be honest, I had NO idea what this show was about.  I've lived in Vegas for a decade, and have seen signs for the show for ages...but I don't see a lot of shows, and I'm on a pretty tight budget.  \nI had a friend who was involved in the show who comped our tickets.\n\nI WILL be going back, and probably paying for front row seats.\n\nWhen we walked in, the \""circus tent\"" like setup (Spiegeltent) was SO unbelivabley cool.   Really, my only complaint about the show is that the seats are SUPER close together...and if you're seated on an end, and someone needs to get into the middle of the row...you are standing up and moving out of the way...the rows and seats are all really close and kind of cramped.  But...other than that issue, there's not a bad seat...I just want the front row so I can be that much closer to the action.\n\nThe show is definitely not safe for kids, or for those who are easily offended.  Lots of cussing, sex humor and drug references from the hosts (who are HILARIOUS!!!), in addition to some implied sexy time fun stuff in the acts.  (A burlesque dancer in pasties, and two \""school girl\"" acrobats that strip down to their undies and portray a budding \""curious\"" relationship.)\n\nI REALLY hope that you all can look past some of the things that you might fine a little offensive to see this show though.\n\nThe acrobatics are incredible.  Stong men, rollerskates, burlesque girls, tight rope walkers, ariealists, trapeze artist...this show has AS MUCH talent as a Cirque du Soleil show, but none of the weird makeup effects.  Also, GREAT music.  \n\nI'm SO glad that I was able to see the show, and can't wait to see it again."
1,"I've always loved this hotel. Lovely location right by the river, near enough to the sports venues for a pretty easy walk over the bridges.\n\nCheck in was pleasant as I've always experienced here, staff were all very friendly and helpful.\n\nRooms were clean but could use a bit of updating; finding a convenient outlet to charge my phone was a bit of a challenge. \n\nOne odd note, you must use your room key in order to turn the lights on in the room. There is a slot for that purpose just as you enter so, take my advice and get at least 2 room keys.\n\nThe restaurant attached to the hotel, a lovely, fine dining establishment called the Old Fishmarket, is slated to close at the end of October, 2014...in it's place is going to be a restaurant called \""Bill's Burgers & Grill\"" I hear it is good, but we shall see next time I stay here.\n\nThere is the option of self-parking or valet parking on site at the hotel."
0,"Being new to Las Vegas, I was excited to visit Westside Trains. I am an experienced model railroader, so maybe my expectations were too high. When I entered the store the person at the counter never even said a word to me. I guess customers are not that important. There was a lot of Lionel trains, but nothing really displayed very well. The HO products were few and basically for beginning modelers. Very few structure kits and certainly no craftsman kits. Equally lacking was any scratch building supplies other than a few plastistruct items. I always prefer to support local businesses, but it looks like I will have to go back to using online stores."
0,Its a McDonald's attached to a gas station so you cant expect much. Food was ok as you cant screw that up to bad at a franchise restaurant. \n\nYou do have to put up with the horrible parking lot/ gas station traffic if you park and go in the dinning room is loud/small with tons of little kids running around (no playground for the kids and the parents seem to let them run wild)\n\nNapkins are by the register not by the the straws or the soda machine so make sure you grab a few when you pay for your meal or you will have to push your way to the front to get them afterwards. \n\nThere are other McDonalds near by and you are better off visiting one of them.
1,"I had no clue what I was doing when I went to this restaurant!  I've only eaten Indian food a few times and this is Southern Indian food.  It is also vegetarian which is fine with me as I tend to not eat a lot of meat.\n\nFirst off:  This place is clean!  I mean this place is spotless.  You seriously could probably eat off of the floor.  Wouldn't but could.  Also I think the staff is cute!  All these amazing men running around from table to table.  I had a groupon and you have to tell them upon entering (and the sign on the door will remind you!) but I don't think they treated me any differently due to that.  I think they did kinda laugh at us behind our backs because my 12 yr. old daughter and I had NO clue what the heck we were ordering and we wound up with plate after plate of food!  \n\nThere was seriously enough for an army and the whole thing came to about $40!  So I don't understand other people saying it's kinda pricey.  I think it's a great deal!  I loved the Onion Pakora.  I am gluten free and haven't been able to have onion rings often due to this.  Well, The Onion Pakora is a nice altenative.  I did like the tamarind sauce served with it but I took some home and they were even MORE amazing with my own Roasted red bell pepper garlic aoli!\n\nWe also had Sambar Vidai, which is a lentil dumpling kind of with a stew type sauce.    It was good!  We also got Paneer Pakora (Fried cheese) which neither of us cared for.  Then a Cheese Masala Dosai, which honestly we took home and I fed my daughter for lunch the following day as she LOVED the Masala.  We also took home a coconut Uthappan, which neither of us cared for.  \n\nMy daughter loved the Batata Vada deep fried potato balls covered in chickpea flour.  It was actually a bit spicy for me but she ate them up!  Yeah, I said we ordered way too much food for the two of us.  We actually ate a few more meals out of the left overs...and the waiter was very gracious about not teasing us.  I think he was awesome!\n\nService was fast and great!  I think I would go back and just get onion pakora and an order of Sambar Vadai and call it way more than enough!  If you are ready to try something new I suggest giving them a try!"
0,"I wish I could review the Megabus, but we did not get what we paid for.. We where to catch the 3:45pm out of Las Vegas to Los Angeles, there was a line for the 3:15pm out of Los Angeles as well.. so we stood behind those people.. the Megabus which looked awesome quickly filled up and they even took some people from our 3:45 to get on the 3:15pm.. Okay they left.. I got excited since we had planned where to sit and I could recharge my laptop and use the wifi... well here's it went to caca.. We didn't get a Megabus.. we got a simple plain boring bus, with no working air, no working lights, no toilet paper, no wifi, no movie, no plugs.. NOTHING!!!! I paid for the Megabus experience and I did  not get that....but I'm sure I will have another opportunity since my mother is making sure we get what we paid for and getting either a refund back or tickets for a future time. \n\nThe one thing I will say about the bus ride, was that it was safe, smooth and we got home 30 minutes ahead of schedule.. but when all you can do is sleep on the bus, it tends to go by fast."
1,"We got the white pizza, pepperoni and pepperoni & sausage pizzas for a work lunch today....sooo good!  My favorite was the white pizza. The crust was perfectly thin and buttery (just the way I like them :D) and a bit crunchy underneath from baking on cornmeal in their seasoned oven.  Really delicious!"
0,"First off this restaurant is located next to conference rooms and not so close to the other restaurants. We visited on a Thursday evening and it was dead in the dining room while the bar was full of loud conference attendees. The food is fine, overpriced like much of the restaurants in Vegas, but not outrageous. The problem was the service, the wait staff was just not bothered, even the manager hung out in the bar area. It took forever to get menus and after our meat almost 15 minutes to get the check, which was ridiculous considering there was only three tables and two servers. We won't be back."
0,My friend and I made an appointment and still waited 15 minutes after we arrived. 2 of the women were rude and one even said my friend asked for the scrub when she didn't and still charged the extra money for it. Never going back!
1,So to start things off my husband is Active Duty Air Force and we're required to go through the base hospital for just about everything unless referred elsewhere. Last night I took my daughter to the Base ER and ended up being transferred over to Sunrise Children's hosp because they couldn't give her the care she needed at the base. We arrived by ambulance transfer at SCH and immediately got great care and attention. The staff at Sunrise is amazing and caring and wonderful and if you ever need to have your child in a hospital it's the place to go! Our first nurse Sunny was sweet and kind and really did a great job getting us settled in at 4am. Robin our 2nd nurse was also very kind and sweet and did an amazing job. Dr. Hendrickson who performed my daughter's procedure was beyond accommodating with our million questions and did such a fabulous job. All in all our 24hr stay at Sunrise was nothing less than fantastic and I hope that if in the future my children need hospitalization that Sunrise is where we go!! Thank you to all the wonderful staff that took such great care of my girl!!
1,"I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place!  \nSigh, I'd let you in on my secret haven. Imagine the Barber Shop, that the kind of place this is in real life. Place is clean, unpretentious and the price extremely reasonable. There are two ladies there who does the pedi and mani. A spa pedi is $22 (only!) and a gel French manicure is $25 (only!). I have been going to Traci but both Traci and Eva will do a fantastic job. \nThey also have hair cut, coloring, lash extension, and facial services. \nWhat I mean though about it being like the Barber Shop is that I do on occasion go in to shoot the breeze with the ladies. Both of them are extremely nice and friendly and we will sit around and chat as though we're sitting on a front porch somewhere waving our fans, having lemonade. \nThere you have it- the best kept secret and my safe haven has been yelped!!!\nWell, guess these ladies are so nice and so great- everyone should know about them. Except of course when I want to get my nails done or go in for a chat!!!!"
1,I get my nails done only *once a month* no lifting and never a broken nail :) Tina and Hannah are amazing and they remeber not only me but what's going on in my life too. Several of my friends are like I am and won't go anywhere else. I get pink & white for $35 and it looks amazing 3-4 weeks later. Don't go anywhere else :)
1,Roger is great!
1,"So I came here since a good friend referred me to it. The restaurant has been open for 2 months so fairly new. Love the restaurant ambiance, dim lighting, sugar skulls, very comfortable seats, big tv's for the bar, and great selection of tequila. \n\nWe sat down at the bar and had Jessy as our server/bartender I believe. Very knowledgeable, we came in for happy hour which is 3-6 pm, $1 street tacos , 3 dollar domestic beers, 4 dollar imports, and 4 dollar well drinks. All beers are in bottle, no draft beer here.  \n\nThey ask you if you would like any chips and salsa they give you 3 types of salsa mild, med, and hot. All 3 were very good.\nFor the tacos I had 1 of each they have 5 types. Top 3 are the Carnitas, alpastor, and cochinito. Get those 3 and you will be extremely happy, especially paying 1 dollar each. The Margarita was decent but not bad.  \n\nWe got 7 street tacos, 1 domestic beer, 1 margarita, beans and rice and only paid 19.47 so yeah I definitely think this place earns 5 stars."
1,"I absolutely adore this little shop. I have been in there 3 times and every time I've walked out with a better deal then the time before. I'm so proud of my finds. I haven't been in to consign anything yet, but I'm building up the courage to do so. I'm a bit intimidated by the process, not sure why I'm sure it's a lot of fun. Way to go Poor Little Rich Girl! \""Now lets go shopping\"" ; )"
0,"I called for delivery to the Holiday Inn, less than a mile away, and the girl on the phone was either stoned or stupid. I repeated my phone number 3 times and she couldn't get it right. I told her I was staying at the HI and she asked for the address so I gave it to her. Then she asks if this is an apartment complex? WTF?!?! NO, IT'S THE HOLIDAY INN!!! Then she wants to know the cross streets and I tell her how the hell would I know I'm staying at the HI, I'm not a local. They can't deliver without knowing the cross streets.... blahblbhalalhalha! I hung up. Get a new phone person!!!"

1,My husband and myself can never say enough good about this restaurant.\nIt is the only vegan place we choose to dine in and is always consistent in its excellence.\nRun by the owners who are there to speak with you.\nWe always love going there and are never disappointed.\nSara & Michael H
1,"Have been here several times, everything is super yummy! Have tried salads, sandwiches and smoothies all delicious. Awesome and friendly service all the time. Really glad this place is close by."
1,"Delicious cupcakes! Every single cupcake I've had here is great! Among my faves are the Oh My Ganache!, the Tickle Me Pink, the Red Velvet. It costs about $2.50 per cupcake, and a dozen goes for $28.\n\nThe shop features cute little trinkets like cards and even aprons! If you get a chance, look at their bulletin board. There are celebrities featured on it, including Lance Bass coming by for a specially made \""cupcake cake\"" celebrating Hairspray (I think that was it). \n\nYou've gotta try it!"
0,"I couldn't see her face all night, so honestly I wouldn't have known if it was her dancing/singing or an imposture. Also she barely spoke to the crowd all night, other than the standard \""Hey Vegas\"". The lines for the bar were ridiculously long and SLOW moving, I'm shocked that they don't staff more people."
1,"I loved it!  We were immediately served boiled peanuts, and then lots of wonderful Korean side dishes after we placed our orders. Everything I had was well prepared:  grilled chicken, kalbi, and meat jun (okay, maybe the meat jun was a little heavy on the egg, but it was delicious)... just like a great plate lunch on O`ahu.  My buddy's sweet-and-sour chicken wasn't what we were expecting, but it was great, too. The service was friendly and nice.  I was slightly apprehensive about the location, but the apprehension was unfounded. Yelp did not let me down.  I know where to get my Hawai`ian food fix when I'm in Las Vegas.  I even had them make me a Spam musubi to go... yum!"
0,"I have eaten at Uncle Sam's periodically since 1991. Today was my last time. We attempted to use a discount card that was purchased from a high school fundraiser. I handed the server the card when I ordered. Only after we were done eating she came over with the check and informed us that we couldn't use the card as the single Pepsi didn't count towards the \""food order.\"" I had the manager come over and all he did was to argue and tell me that he would get fired if he gave the small discount as it was the \""owner's orders.\"" I asked if they were willing to lose a customer over having the proper purchase amount but being just $2.00 short in the \""food cost.\"" He essentially told me that if that was how I felt he couldn't do anything about it \""owner's orders.\"" If they are so absurdly adamant the card should have been more legible as I couldn't read the fine print even with reading glasses, and the server should have informed me of the fact when I ordered not after the meal was consumed. Any business that is willing to lose a customer over a few cents doesn't deserve to be in business. (The soft drinks are a huge profit margin for them, so the inflexible policy is inane.)\n\nOn another note the sandwiches are quite good although I can easily make a better Philly Cheesesteak at home. The pizza and wings are merely average. If you want far better wings go, to Sardella's."
1,"Great food, great service and the decor transports you all the way to Ireland. What more can you ask for? Get the fish and chips, you'll thank me."
0,"If you like expensive, fatty BBQ, then is the place for you. \nAfter reading all of the gushing reviews for Little Miss, we decided to give it a try. We were third in line and the 25 minute wait wasn't bad. When we got inside the place, my wife looked at the menu board and went \""Oh No\"". The prices were quite high, a two meat plate with tax was over 16 bucks $16.00+. We both ordered lean brisket and a rib plus 2 sides. \nTo be fair, both the brisket and rib was tender but since they wrap the brisket and ribs in either butchers paper or aluminum foil and put them in a warming oven before carving, a leather boot would be tender. \nBoth cuts were loaded with fat. I do not mind some marbling on my BBQ but this was over the top with fat. The meat itself was bland. No slight flavor from the dry rub or the hardwood.  Personally, a bit of crusty bark on \""Q\"" does a lot for the flavor.\nLittle Miss is a step above, Rudy's, Honey Bears, Dave's and Can't Stop Smokin BBQ but price wise any of those places are a better money value.\nWould I return to Little Miss BBQ? No!"
0,"Great food,  horrible,  ghetto service. They never answer the phone or keep accurate hours"
0,"Meh\n\nYou know, this resto club used to have great food, which came from the AIX kitchen, downstairs. Now AIX is gone, and the food, when it eventually comes, looks better than it tastes, UNLESS you like really rich food. Like really rich. As in a thick white truffle cappuccino and a butter-like fois gras. The combination of tastes on the plate is...odd. I can understand, for example, the theory behind mixing the fatty salmon tartar with acidic apple, but, well, it doesn't work. The fois gras plate was equally challenged. The worst was their Christmas yuletide log chocolate dessert, which was essentially a stale Twinkie...\n\nOn the bright side, the decor and service was very good (apart from the slow, slow kitchen). In fact, this is one of the only restaurants I've been to where the waitress waited for everyone to finish before clearing the plates - very unusual."
0,"I tested the Vibration 360 when I was at the store.  After thinking about it for a few days I called the store to see if the Vibration 360 was still available.  The clerk ensured me that I would get a new machine rather than the floor model which is \""tested\"" by every man, woman, and child passing through.  I even asked her about assembly of my \""new\"" machine.  She told me that someone would assemble it and that assembly was included in the delivery fee.  I paid for the machine in full over the phone.  To my surprise the machine arrived already put together so I figured it must have been assembled at the store.  The machine had multiple deep scratches and the frame was cracked.  WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I AGREE TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR A USED MACHINE WITH DEEP SCRATCHES AND CRACKS!!!!  I tried to call the clerk back on her cell, but no answer.  I told the poor deliver guy (nice guy) that I was refusing delivery.  He called his manager who apologized and stated that he would deliver a new one to me....AS PROMISED!!\n\nThe trust is gone!  I will NEVER order from this store ever again.  This attempt to get rid of a badly used floor model lacked integrity!!!!"
1,"My wife & I dropped in for lunch as we stumbled upon Gaati while shopping at Trader Joe's. We both had Tom Kah Gai - coconut milk chicken soup with lemongrass for a starter. My wife had the spicy mint chicken and I had red chicken curry. Having spent months in Thailand, the flavors at Gaati are authentic and I share others opinions about prices. All in all, I recommend Gaati for genuine Thai cuisine, even though it's 20% higher in price. But other Thai restaurants don't match the flavors at Gaati. We'll return for another round and let you know."
1,"So far This is the only True Neapolitan Certified pizza that I tried that taste good to me. This weekend we tried the famous Bianca D.O.C. pizza (white pizza $12) and the Regina Margherita D.O.C. ($14) The margherita was tasty flavorful and very light,the dough was wet but did have some structure and was seasoned perfect so it wasn't necessary to add a thing. I did find the bufala cheese too wet for this pie and prefer the Margherita D.O.C.  (difference is house made mozzarella and a $4 savings $10)\nThe Bianca pie was much sturdier and also not wet. For my taste the pie is very garlicky and for my taste next time I will be adding the onion option for $2 more to balance the flavors more.\n\nNext to us the people were having the home made cheese cake and it looked so light and fluffy I got a piece to try the next day. I tried a little and it was light,not too sweet but was light on the vanilla. I prefer this style and think it was the best I've tried in years.\n\nI've been here several times and always had outstanding service here."
1,"It's Calabria's - what more can you say. Great good, reasonable prices, and a nice, relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThis location and the Upper St. Clair location are both winners. Everything is homemade. The restaurants are super clean, the menu has a nice variety, and the staff is always friendly and helpful."
0,If you want good Mexican food do not go here. It's the Mexican version of mcdonalds and I will never have it again.
1,My wife and I stopped in and we both really enjoyed it. We've been to a number of Thai restaurants in Las Vegas and this is easily better than most.\n\nFood was fresh and tasty and the service was good.\n\nI especially liked the duck fried rice.
0,"All the buffet standards, but a bit more Asian for New Year's?  Definitely not worth $43.95....There was not a huge variety, pizza?,Italian, Asian, French I think....salad/fruits, sushi.  I passed on the Chinese, looked like stuff from panda Express.  I had a thick cut prime rib that I had the cook sear on the grill, which then becomes a rib eye steak essentially but very tender of course.  Anybody that hasn't tried it, should.  The sushi looked weak, so I passed.  The crab legs weren't very fresh, they were kinda soggy?  The Ceasar salad looked better than it tasted.\nOverall, disappointed.  Everything else about the Wynn/Encore is great, somehow they neglected the buffet.  Even Paris did a better job w/ stone crab too for only $27.  Mr. Wynn, could you please fix that? I honestly think I could put on a better spread than they did!!!!  I did have a rib eye at SWITCH in the Encore, but that's another review....til next time, good eating!"

They didn't tell me it was extra and I found it quite disappointing to pay so much for so little."
0,"Inattentive waitresses with attitude. Ick. The sizzling rice soup was delish but everything else was just fine. I mean, it's Chinese food. There's bad chinese food and decent chinese food... but hard to really make anything excellent. Not any more \""authentic\"" than anywhere else, but that said we stuck with americanized dishes like chicken w/ veggies and chow mein. They definitely have more options for more authentic stuff like shark's fin soup and abalone though if you're feeling adventurous. But regardless, I doubt I'll be back."
1,"Amazing food. Good service and atmosphere.\n\nOrdered:\n\nOnion soup - the flavor was good, but nothing very special about it.\n\nFoie Gras - This is amazing. all the ingredients on the plate work extremely well with each other. Beside the seared foie gras, it also has berries, marcona almond, some granola (i guess) on the plate. I initially thought how the heck these ingredients end up on the same plate. but later realized that if you combine all ingredients in 1 bite, it cuts through the fatty taste of the foie gras and at the same time enhancing the richness and pure taste of the foie gras and melt in your mouth. There's definitely some chemistry between those ingredients in order to deliver that fantastic taste. \n\nBeef wellington - how can we not try beef wellington when coming to ramsay's restaurant. It was awesome. The beef was very tender, and it melt in your month, it really just like eating chocolate type of melt in your month. \n\nKobe rib cap - The steak was very good. tender, good flavor, may not be the best steak I have ever had, but can't really find anything to complain about it either.\n\nSome side dishes are good. I saw a lot of people ordered bake potato (they are huge), I am not a fan of potato, but if a lot of tables were ordering it, it may be good."
0,"I had a Groupon & was excited to use it & share cupcakes with multiple friends.  Wow, was I disappointed!  6 of us tried a variety of flavors (Monday offerings).  The cake was exceedingly dry & crumbly with no flavor.  The frosting was so sweet that your teeth ached & totally masked any flavor.  My Groupon was for $30.  In order to get an even dozen, I had to purchase an additional cupcake.  Price listed was $3 but I was charged, in total, almost $6.  Still haven't figured that one out.  Please try another cupcake purveyor before you head out to this one.  I could truly make better desserts at home with a boxed mix."
1,"I absolutely love this French steakhouse. I have to go to Vegas often for work, which does not make me happy, but I always cheer myself up with the prospect of going here for dinner. The interior is cool, very French, lots of light, but I like sitting outside in the evening to enjoy the Bellagio fountain shows. The restaurant's patio is directly across the street from the Bellagio. Now the food: woohoo! My favorite salad is the endive salad. It is extremely fresh and flavorful. I love the filet mignon here. They typically serve it in a merlot reduction, but I prefer to get it with the butter herb sauce, which is delicious and much lighter than it sounds. The pommes frittes are perfect, thin, crispy, great seasoning. And the flavors you will find here are indeed French."
0,Overpriced. Tiny dishes.. Food was cold. Avoid at all costs.
0,"If I could leave a negative star review, I would. This was the absolute worst dining experience I've ever had. We were seated and then ignored for 45mins. I sat at the table with my hand obnoxiously raised while 4 servers proceeded to walk past without stopping to ask if we needed anything. I then proceeded to ask the hostess to speak with the manager, to which she said she would go get him, only to turn around and seat another table, completely ignoring my request. I then asked the bartender to speak with the manager who took my request and turned his back and went about his business. I asked 2 more servers who the manager was before I actually got a chance to speak with him. The manager couldn't care less about the horrid service we were receiving. A server finally came over who took am additional 15mins to get out drink order and messed up our food order. I think it's safe to say I will never again return to Carrabba's ever again. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
0,"Worst place with rude stylist!\nThey don't cut good and charge twice as much as other places. this is my worst experience ever! now i have no choice but to get stuck with this bad hair ...\n\nI went there it looks clean and there were magazines for you to look at and choose hair styles from. I did not wait that long and the receptionist was very nice and friendly(but later on realized she was not a receptionist, but a stylist, they don't have  receptionist). I am a very bubbly person and i am always smiling but this place just turned me into a whole new person. when the stylist asked me what i want i just told her i want to get rid of my split ends and a little shorter because i am bored with my long hair, but just keep the layersand trim the bangs (side bangs). she totally cut the hair straight, like when you look at the back on my shoulders it's a straight line not a V shape which means she got rid of my layers. and she also cut my bangs straight across my forehead, she cut it too short that it bounce up like a spring and i cannot put it on the side. I asked her to cut 2inches more because i told her i wanted it shorter and she was very rude and told me \""are you sure just 2inches, coz i can;t keep on cutting little by little\"" she was very loud and rude that all the other customers are looking at me and she is making it sound that i am being picky when i was all smiling and low voice when i am speaking to her. so i just told her to leave it it's fine and she still kept on saying \""are you? sure are you sure?\"". omg she wont stop and i feel so embarassed already. she said i was done and i wnet to pay and she said i owe $37 ... i saw on their wall it says adult cut and shampoo is $13.99 and i got a coupon that says i can get a haircut and shampoo for $10.99 ... she told me that she styled my hair so it's adult cut, style and shampoo which is $21.99  plus to blow dry my hair is additional $15 .... OMG what a rip off $15 to blow dry your hair??? are they not supposed to dry it anyway to check if their cut is accurate and no imperfections??? and what style??? she charged me more coz she  styled my hair, when in fact she just cut my hair straight and got rid of my old style which is the layers ... there were people waiting to pay and it was so embarassing i just paid the utrageous amount and left.  I am not really a picky person and I don't really ike to complain ... that is why i just paid and left ... but my hubby said i am always too nice that is why people take advantage of me ... so hopefully this review will be a warning to other people ... if you know your hairstylist and she is awesome for you then keep her, but if you go to fantastic sams don't go to that lady with light brown hair in a ponytail that looks mean because she is really rude."
0,"I found the food to be okay, not great,  but the prices were quite high.  $3 for a side of chips and I think you could have counted about 35 chips in the bowl.  The salsa was delicious but the chicken burro was not that good and again quite pricey for the small size of it.  Also, shabby chic would be a huge upgrade from this mess of a restaurant.  Just a little too run-down for my liking."
0,"So I had just bought my MacBook Pro a while back about a month or so got it on Black Friday when I bought it full price @1600.00 or so  n they gave me a free 150$ gift card as a gift also, which I thought was nice, but after a while I felt I really didn't think I needed all that computer thought I would wait an buy one with less memory downgrade. I go I ask to return it  explained why I was returning it the guy just starts checking it sees everything is good. Starts telling me that he's going to discount the gift card off of the price so I was ok I guess cause I already used it an all it's ok I thought but the thing that really disappointed me is that they are going to mail me a check, it's going to take 2-3 weeks to get to me! I can't believe this when I bought this laptop I paid cash I didn't give them no freaking check saying cash it in 2-3 weeks it's stupid how they treat customers returning their merchandise I could tell they didn't like it when said I was returning they're stupid computer so now I have to wait on a check for 1450.00 dollar check  because of a gift card they gave me as a gift wow, good luck to anybody returning something there."
1,"It's Dublin in Las Vegas. \n\nThis Guinness Store is the first in the Americas. \n\nSip Guinness next door @ R\u00ed R\u00e1, nosh on bar bites U.K. style and visit this beer-themed shop before and/or after. Good quality sweaters and cotton shirts, vintage tin plaques, and other memorable trinkets and housewares. Most of the images emblazoned on the items are taken from the Guinness archives and show the beer company in it's beginnings. Who knew a tropical toucan could play such an important role in Irish popular culture?\n\nThere is an ample collection of Gaelic football scarves, for fans and a discounted area in the far back of the store. If you love the Emerald Isles this is a must-stop, especially if you can't make it to the real deal. \n\nPostcards are $1 and have the shrunken down versions of the vintage posters celebrating beer and Ireland and more specifically, Irish beer drinking. If you don't want the usual Las Vegas pit stop souvenirs this is a nice respite with a unique ambiance. More low-key than other shops on the Strip.\n\nYou can have your purchases hand-delivered to your room, free of charge, if you are in the Mandalay Bay or THEhotel (a.k.a Delano) and want to walk around more before retiring for the night."
1,"Service is attentive w/o being intrusive.  Had the pretzel/provolone appetizer (again!); and the short rib stew for something different.  Both were excellent.  Manager - Melissa, stopped by a few times to ensure everything was A-ok!"
0,"This dealership is the primary reason I decided to sell my 2011 E550 and buy a Ford.\n\nWhat? Why? Their service department took a serious downturn. \n\nMy old service advisor, Brett, was superb. He was so knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful - I enjoyed coming in for service (warranty or maintenance). He was a proactive communicator and accurate with his estimates and scheduling.\n\nThe new service advisor, Sam, leaves much to be desired... \n\n- Doesn't seem to understand much about cars; I had a suspension component fail in November, and when I asked for information about the specific nature of the failure, he said, \""a part on your front suspension with a bracket was broken.\"" Uh, ok?\n\n- Didn't know a thing about my car or its service history, despite having a massive print-out and computer screen full of info about my car in front of him. I had a suspension issue (again) and when I told him that it had happened before, he said, \""Um, I don't see that in your history. Are you sure it happened before?\"" I took a look in the paperwork and pointed out the 2 previous visits for the same issue...\n\n- Horrible scheduling. During my last visit, my car was in the shop for 10+ days. I was originally told it would take 3-4 days to repair. I was then called 4-days in a row, usually at around 4:30pm with this exact message (each time): \""Um, hi Steve? Um, this is Sam with Zimbrick European. Um, due to issues with work load and technician shortages, your car won't be ready today. Is that ok?\"" \n\nNot once, but four days in a row... and what could I say, other than \""Ok\""? The car was torn apart and needing repair. \n\n- Most recent maintenance was a nightmare. I was an ASE-certified master technician for many years, and know my way around a car. Zimbrick doesn't tell you that when you bring your vehicle in for prepaid maintenance that they still charge you for tire rotations and wiper blade replacements. I was shocked to have $130 in extra charges ($50 for a tire rotation (seriously!) and $80 for wiper blades (seriously!)), so when I scheduled this last service, I specifically asked that they hold-off on rotating the tires and replacing the wiper blades, as I could do it myself.\n\nSam acted as though he heard me, but when he printed the service order, I noticed he didn't document my request. I asked him to make note of it and he said, \""Oh, they'll know to not do the rotation or wiper blades.\"" I begged to differ, and then he hand-wrote on the ticket to skip the rotation & blades. As I was leaving, he said, \""Good thing you reminded me of that, because they probably would've charged you.\"" Really? A minute ago they knew not to do it...\n\n- The past few visits were impossible to get scheduled in a timely manner. I had one serious issue with the car that rendered it non-functional, and when I called for service, the \""earliest\"" they could schedule me for was 17-days out. I asked to speak with the service manager to see if there was any way I could get in earlier, and when I did, he was equally unhelpful. Basically gave me the, \""Well, there's not much we can do\"" response. Thanks for nothing.\n\nSo, adios, Mercedes-Benz. My E550 had an original sticker of $79k. I didn't pay that for it, but if I did, I'd be so incensed by this dealer's service department, I'd probably go postal... I cringe for folks that are driving S-class and AMG vehicles..."
1,"This is the best Mexican restaurant in Urbana, for sure. Sorry Maize, but you have no soul. The salsas are what makes this place special. The first is an orange-colored creamy chipotle salsa, the second is a green creamy salsa made with tomatillos and avocado, and the last one is a light, smokey flavored dark red salsa. Carne asada or the barbacoa are great on tacos or sopes. The al pastor is a little too greasy. If you go here please get anything but a burrito: burritos are NOT Mexican. You're missing out if you go for a burrito here. And get your tacos with cilantro and onion. None of that lettuce cheese tomato."
0,Food was good. Desserts are amazing.\nBut bad bad bad customer service. I will never go back.
1,"Great pizza and really good beer too!  The service was somewhat slow, but extremely helpful and the atmosphere was cozy and definitely a relaxed neighborhood vibe!"
0,"Went in for a meal and a pint with my wife. After reading the menu and then going to the bar to order, was ignored by the bar man (smarmy git with a wannabe beard and fake posh boy english accent) several times. I was clearly in his eye sight, made eye contact with him and he continued to serve others. As I stepped right up to the bar he made it obvious that he wouldn't serve me. So after a couple more minutes and a fellow patron asking me if I wanted to move even closer to get noticed, I decided to take my business elsewhere. Very disappointed and hopefully the plant pot of a bar man gets his cards sooner or later. Idiot!!"
1,Terry and Carlos were great!! They were professional they knew exactly what to do. My husband called in for a couples or back to back one hour deep tissue massage. their hands were very well trained. Our wait was minimum. One thing I loved was that they pointed out which bed was going to be taken care of by which therapist and left us to undress. It showed they were sensitive to customer preference of the gender of the therapist in clients. So my husband picked the male therapist while I the female. The massage was agony because I had amazing no of knots but it is what needs to be healed. Terry knew Sciatica and she knew medical massage techniques of stretches that loosen the vicious knot in my left shoulder blade that triggered the pain. The hot towels were great and the hot stone on the bad knot really soothed the pain and got the blood going. Ongoing visits are capped at $49 which is very reasonable for the quality of massage. We give it a 5 star!!!!
0,"I like how every girl on here gives this place 1 star, and the guys usually give it 3 stars.\n\nThat says a lot, bc if there is one hting i know about guys it is that they freaking love boobs.  The Tilted Kilt has boobs everywhere.  More than a strip club.  So many boobs I wondered if it was a health code violation.  So it having 3 or 4 star reviews from dudes tells you this is a 1 star restaurant.\n\nIt should be no surprise that I was out with a guy and I did NOT pick this place.  In fact, I'm pretty sure no girl in the history of girls has ever said, \""I want a fish sandwich and to stare at tits.\""  \n\nOur waitress was very nice, and I've got to say that if my body looked like hers, I'd be wearing the Tilted Kilt uniform daily, whether i worked there or not.\n\nWe had hamburgers.  They were standard hamburgers.  WHAT IS IT WITH RESTAURANT HAMBURGER BUNS????  Once again, the bun was MASSIVE nad htat drives me crazy.  However, the hambuger was so greasy the bun immediately became full of oil and shrank down.  Kinda gross, but also kind of impressive.  That was an absorbent bun!\n\nThe place was wildly over priced and I don't know how anyone could sit there and watch an entire game and drink all night.  If you want to piss your wife off, do that.  Go to the Tilted Kilt and drink all night, then tell her that's where you were all night and that your bar tab was $150.\n\nI think it might be less expensive to go to a strip club.  Go to one with a buffet, and save some money.\n\nThe food was meh, the waitress was ok, the tits were large, the drinks were expensive.   -Fin-"
0,"Too many bad years to even put them at average.  Outside of the superbowl run in 2008, no consistency historically.  Honestly, without that superbowl appearance, they will be sitting at one star.  From the days in St Louis to when they were playing at ASU....marked team on the schedule - easy win\n\nGrade: D"
0,"Awful food!! Shells are not crispy, partially cooked, meat has NO NO NO flavor.  Their combinations stink - People don't just eat Enchilada's! Poor choice on the Taco salad. Rolled tacos are called Taquitos.  There is no juiciness with the Fajitas, the prices are out of sight. Re-fried Beans are usually mashed so there are bits of beans, but not whole uncooked beans...disgusting! Kid's menu goes to 10, what are 11, 12  year olds? Adults? \n\nYour menu needs an overhaul. The bathrooms are small and smell like mildew. Waitresses take forever to get you drink refills - unless its a bar item. The space in the building is so cramped you can't sit 4 comfortably at a table. \n\nThe old green color on the walls is so uninviting. Why not decorate like an authentic Mexican restaurant? Horse pictures - is old west, not Mexican. American / Mexican restaurant - maybe. \n\nAnita's Cocina is tired, needs a desperate update. Get with today's technology offer free wifi. Take your outside decorations inside, call restaurant impossible...you need help!"
1,"Go figure that I would spot this place even before I got to the coffee shop that I was looking for.  After my coffee splurge I decided to come in here for a look-see.  My attention was first caught by the 20% off handbags, and I did look at a few business totes that a sales associate was most helpful with.  This surprised me because I had the impression that the staff at the store might be the snooty, but she wasn't.  They have quite a variety of brands here that include Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Juicy Couture amongst others, which I believe DSW does not carry.  The sales aren't as great.  I did get 30% off a pair of Charles David shoes here, and many of the shoes don't come with shoe boxes.  The cashier was nice enough to give me a nice Cole Haan shoe bag perfect for packing in my luggage.  I was enticed by these Juicy Couture boots here, but I walked away..."
1,"I've been going here for a couple of years already and enjoy their Italian beef sandwiches. This place has got them tasting closest to Chicago style Italian beef, but I'm still on the hunt for something that tastes just like Portillo's. Their Chicago style pizza is also very good. If you've never tried it before, get the smallest pie possible. One slice will do you in, unless you can eat like a total fatty. Oh, and of course, try the Chicago dog!"
1,"Subaru Miller in Salt Lake City Utah was extremely satisfying in customer service. It is surprising that Subaru in Chandler surpassed my expectations! \n\nMy experience today was a routine warranted maintenance checkup for a 2013 Subaru Impreza. The time was 90 minutes and free of charge, including a free vacuum and wash. My car is smokin clean! \n\nDulce has been my rep three times and I am extremely satisfied. She is thorough in her explanations and spot on her repair time estimate, to the minute.\n\nWhat makes Subaru so wonderful is their environment. WIFI, TV, cookies, fruit, and quality Starbucks coffee and tea, all complimentary! \n\nThe bathrooms are modern, the floors clean, leather seats next to the TV, high individual tables for work space and moderately quiet environment. \n\nWith their expected repair shop expansion this October 2014, I can only expect better things with this Subaru branch."
1,"I bring my 6 month old husky here almost every day.  She's got so much energy that even her daily runs don't kill the energy. \n\nThey have 3 separated spots. First is for smaller dogs, under 25lbs. Middle is for small to medium and the last is for the larger dogs.  Obviously the last section for the bigger dogs is a way larger space than the gated area for smaller dogs. Sometimes you'll get people who go in the wrong section but no problem with that since most dogs are friendly.  My pup has no cares to chase the balls or toys or people. She just wants to chase the other dogs.\n\nWe've encountered lots of dogs here from pit bulls to blue heelers. Never had a problem with owners or dogs until recently. Dog parks should be for dogs who are trained and friendly with other dogs. DO NOT BRING YOUR DOGS YOU CANT CONTROL & ARE AGGRESSIVE. That doesn't make it comfortable for anyone. There was one man with two dogs who were not friendly and he had a hard time controlling them. Definitely shouldn't be at a dog park.\n\nOther than that one time, I love this dog park. It's VERY dark at night and lights shut off at 11."
1,What an excellent find!  Went there for breakfast with 3 others.  All our choices were good but the pancakes were awesome!  Light and flavorful. And they served them with a big pitcher of syrup instead of the usual mini thimble portion most restaurants serve that disappear after the first bite.  Never had to wait for coffee refills.  Our waitress was very attentive and we even got a visit from the owner who visited each table to make sure everything was top notch.  Good job you guys!  We'll be back!  \nP & friends
1,"My recent tip about this Smith's said:  \""Got a dilemma for what to serve with wine? Better talk to Marissa at the gourmet cheese deli! She is amazing!\""  I mean, you can buy groceries at any ol' supermarket, but you won't find someone like Marissa.  I wanted to bring something divalicious to Jazz in the Park and she hooked me up with her own recipe.  Told me how to prep some goodies from the gourmet olive bar and mix it with a freshly-bottled, luscious EVOO from California.  She actually walked me over to the bakery to select the rustic Tuscan bread and showed me how to slice it myself with the equipment.  Who gives concierge service like that?  Not Whole Foods!  I created a fabulous crostini topping that got rave reviews and was perfect with a nice red blend on a warm summer night.  She also showed me a new winner--cranberry/jalapeno jelly that topped a smooth walnutty double-cr\u00e8me cheese.  If you're the skeptical, picky type, know that you get to taste test the combos before you buy!"

0,"Montevida was a decent place to live for the year we were there. It became more inconvenient to get in and out as the light rail construction ramped up. The office staff had a \""Can I help you?\"" type of attitude as soon as the lease was signed as oppose to the \""How may I help?\"" they treat you with when trying to lure you in. The maintenance was okay. They usually had a quick fix approach as oppose to fully solving the problem. The apartment layout was nice and unique, spacious closets, nice bathroom. \n\nMy BIGGEST complaint was how they advised me to have the carpet professionally cleaned when we moved out, so that they would not include this as deduction from our security deposit refund.  After turning it a signed receipt from the cleaning company (as requested), they have failed to remove this as deduction. After multiple visits and six months later, they have failed to refund this."
0,Updated:  they simply can't get their Americanos done right even with complaints and no I am not picky. .   After a few visits with no better results they get a one star review at best

0,"A few friends and I went to Bliss on Sunday for a girl's day out.  What a mistake.  While the spa was clean, that's the best I can say about it.  The spa is so small that four ladies cramped into the waiting room was too much for me and I had to go out into the hallway and wait for my massage.  Once I got into the treatment room I was told off the bat that I was late and that my session would need to be shortened.  I was not late, I had to wait for her!!!  And then her technique was that of a beginner. The worst massage ever and I'm 58 years old!  \n\nThere is only one shower, one steam room, two bathroom stalls, you have to get undressed and dressed in basically the foyer.  No place to lounge.  What a rip off is all I can say.  Never recommend this spa (or so they call it) to anyone."
0,"I went into this dinner with high expectations.  I had heard only goods things.  \nWe had a great server.  She was very friendly and helpful.  When we were there we saw that they were participating in restaurant week.  \n\nWe immediately did the couples special because it was a great deal.  We ordered calamari for the appetizer and though it was crispy, it was extremely bland and only luke warm when we received it.  \n\nI then had a bowl of clam chowder and this we pretty good.  For our main courses we got chicken Parmesan and cod dish.  The chicken Parmesan was similar to the appetizer in that it was very bland.  We were expecting delicious Italian food and received nothing special.  My fish was extremely over cooked but the server was very helpful in getting me a new dish.  I tried the Primavera and was pleasantly surprised.  It was very good.  \n\nWe tried the cheesecake dessert and the lemon cake and both were delicious.  \n\nUnfortunately the food was nothing that would temp me to come back especially for the prices you pay."
1,No words needed other than this is how pizza should be. Every single time. The best I have ever had!
1,It's been awhile since I've been here but it's pretty nice inside. I like that it's not on the strip but has enough stuff to do at the hotel.
1,"Breakfast at MOzen was a great experience! Their walnut-banana french toast was quite delicious and everything else, from their pastries to granola to waffles was good. The omelets are different in a good way! \n\nTheir beverages are a little pricey ($9 for most, including tea/coffee) but those are listed on the menu! \n\nThe service was very good and overall a positive experience!"
0,"I don't like giving a 1 star rating. I usually reserve that for a really horrible experience but in this case, this place earned a one star rating. I know that is harsh but this place straight up sucked. \n\nThere were 8 of us and when you have a large group it's difficult to coordinate where to go to eat. Someone in the group suggested we check out the Binion and off we went. We stumbled across Benny's and decided to go in since it wasn't busy. \n\nThere is no hostess stand so you walk in and find your own table to sit at, at least I think that's how it works. The middle aged waitress didn't acknowledge us while we were standing at the front. We walked around the small space seeing if there was a table for 8, there was not. There's only tables for 4. One couple was leaving and told us we could have their table to put together with the open table next to theirs. We did that. The waitress came over and did a quick wipe down with a dirty rag that left streaks and food behind. Eeww. I ended up wiping it down with the paper towels that were on the table.\n\nThe menu consists of 4 things. Full rack or half rack of ribs, 1/2 roasted chicken or 1/2 roasted chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs. Prices were really cheap. I'm thinking with only 4 things on the menu, the food has to be phenomenal. I was wrong. Mediocre. The ribs were a dry rub with sauce on the side. The sauce tasted like bottled sauce. My corn was the smallest out of the group about 2 inches long. The slaw was watery and the baked beans tasted like a pound of sugar was dumped in it. I didn't try the corn bread. My friend's chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was pink by the bone so she didn't eat it.\n\nService was slllloooooooowwwwww. My 86 grandma walks faster than she does. It took about 15 mins (and I'm being generous) for our waitress to come over and give us menus and even longer for her to come back and take our order. She left her bifocals on our table and when we were finally able to flag her down she mentioned she was looking all over for it because she couldn't put in our order since she couldn't see the computer screen. Great. We probably waited about an hour for our food. I really wanted to walk out but my friends said to give it a couple of more mins. Luckily we got our food after that. \n\nOne thing I saw that really disturbed me was, I saw our waitress dumping water glasses full of ice into the water pitcher. I know what I saw. She had 3 of the red water glasses, the same one I was drinking out of and saw her dump all 3 one at a time into the water pitcher. I don't know if she was recycling customers drinking water or if she used the glasses as a vessel to carry ice. She then dropped ice on the counter and scooped it up off the counter with her bare hands and dumped it into the pitcher. I stopped drinking the water and told my friends not to drink it.\n\nThere was another waitress there, a younger one but she was more preoccupied with coming in and out of the restaurant. Can't tell you what she was doing but she wasn't working that's for sure. \n\nWhen our very frazzled and slow waitress finally brought our check, she actually gave us the wrong check. We had to flag her down and get the correct one. We spent another 15 mins waiting for her to come back with my friend's credit card. Actually she didn't come back so we went to her. My other friends went to go gamble while we dealt with her and my friend's now missing credit card. When she finally found it she hadn't processed it yet. While she was doing that she told us that the party before us forgot their credit card...uh..more like you forgot to give it back. \n\nAlso there was a young couple smoking their vapor there which I thought was rude and disrespectful. I overheard our waitress tell the young man \""oh you go boy, just like smoking a hookah\""...wow...just wow. We were there for more than 2 hours. Walk past this place and don't do it. Seriously not worth it."
0,"DTM: Doing Too Much\n\nA bar that serves food without beers-on-draft isn't a bar at all. Fill the place up with old people, a heavy metal band you've never heard of, and deck the place in horror film decorations... the usual barfly will be quite disoriented. \n\nFOOD: The \""menu\"" is freakishly small. We ordered the fried mushrooms, a burger, and a sausage & peppers sub. It was served up on plates that looked like they came out of a Color Me Mine studio. That's acceptable at home, but at a bar? Once I got over the whack plates, I discovered the food tasted as though a college kid cooked our meal in a dorm-room kitchenette--if you get what I mean: cold bread, basic condiments, and no flavor. To say the least, it was edible.I can make better food at home. And considering that no one else in the joint was eating, our food took abnormally long to get to the table. \n\nDRINKS: Liquor. Bucket of PBR deal. Exorbitant mark-ups on bottled beer, not a tap in sight. Basic beer selections (nothing special): Bud, Corona, Dos Equis, etc.\n\nUnderworld is trying to do too many concepts and they're not doing any of them very well. All the employees are decked out as zombies. But I don't consider the services here worth paying for. We used a $5 for $10 Restaurant.com coupon; we have one left but we wish we didn't. This space has been a bit of a fail whale spot; guess Underworld is following in the footsteps of previous occupants!"
1,"Walking into The Lost Leaf, I instantly knew I'd be back again!  Live music playing in the back room, great crowd and artsy decor spelled \""Home\"" for me.\nWent with a bunch of other Yelpers (Happy Birthday, Jacqui!) and had a blast.  The music wasn't so loud I couldn't hear anyone I was talking with.  Seemed like an awesome beer selection, though I didn't see what wine was offered.\nI am one of the few who really likes the high-tops.  \nThe clientele was a younger crowd of Phoencians enjoying what the downtown of PHX has to offer.  It was full, but I think I expected a larger crowd on a Saturday night.  \nThe local art on the walls made it seem less pretentious than most places.  And, the wood!  Wood everywhere!  I thought I was back East.  Hardwood floors, beamed ceiling.  I could picture it as a place to go after skiing back home.  \nI thought the kitchen was cute, but a little \""homey\"".  I swear I saw a dishwasher, and not an industrial one!\nOf course, couldn't beat the company!  Jacqui and Dave B, Nathan, Kristin, Stevey P and my favorite boys, Thomas and Ricky made the night A+"
1,"We ended up at this place when we tried to hit Over Easy at 11:45 on a Sunday morning and were told they were closed. Bummer! \n\nDidn't want to wait in line at Matt's and had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Took the trip down Camelback Rd. to The Breakfast Club. \n\nThe wait was pretty decent for a Sunday morning in the middle of old town Scottsdale. The host was friendly and helpful and seated us at a communal table with plenty of room between us and the other couple that was seated there.\n\nI started off with a cup of coffee and my girlfriend went with a glass of fresh pineapple juice. Our drinks came quickly. The coffee was pretty great at this place. Hit the spot nicely. My girlfriend's pineapple juice was perfectly chilled and crisp. \n\nShe came back to take our order. I went with the Mignon Benedict and my girlfriend went with the roasted turkey benedict. The food arrived pretty quickly, and my glass of coffee was refilled a few times in the meantime. Atmosphere was nice and relaxing, despite the expected ridiculousness of some of the people that hang out in Old Town. \n\nMy food was fantastic. The steak was still red in the center. At $13 for the sandwich, I wasn't expecting the quality of steak I got. My girlfriend's dish was actually even better than mine. Our waitress was fantastic. Definitely hitting this spot again."
0,"Ugh....\n\nI went in humming \""I want my babyback, babyback, babyback\"" and left wanting to give the babyback, babyback babyback.\n\nI'd never had the ribs before and since I had a 3 hour layover and a 4 hour flight I thought it was a good time to try a larger meal. Turns out it was a large meal of nothing. \n\nThe \""steak\"" fries were the best part and they were just tolerable. Cut like McDonald's fries, I was left wondering what made them \""steak\"" fries... a little seasoning? A least they were cooked correctly. Not the crunchy outside, vacuuous inside alien food you get at a lot of places.\n\nThe corn on the cob was actually gross. It had been cooked so long ago all the starch had turned to sugar. It tasted like cream of corn... too sweet, artificial sweet. It was also so water logged that water literally poured with each bite. It should be served in the middle of a kiddie pool with a headrest so you don't drown when you fall asleep from boredom. I couldn't take more than a few bites. \n\nThe Bar-B-Que sauce was extremely vinegary... pucker vinegary... and I like vinegar! It left little room for any flavor. \n\nUnfortunately, it appears the sauce and the ribs had only just met as the ribs had no flavor... none. This provided for some sharp flavor contrasts that were none too appealing. The meat wasn't quite tough.. but not falling apart either.... and they were well done. So well done that the fat and any natural flavor had left them long ago. \n\nThe service and management were very good. Seating was crowded for a normal restaurant and unbearable in a restaurant where everyone has luggage.... the physical kind... not the mental kind. That's another story. \n\nIf you're traveling through Charlotte my advice is to let your mom pack your meals in your carry on like she wants to and mortgage the house so you can buy a soda or two once past security."
0,"** If you are a parent that thinks it is acceptable to allow your child to run amuck, please stop reading now **\n\nI really like sushi.  I love sitting at the sushi bar, enjoying some good food and conversation.  So, when my friend suggested that we go to Pure I was looking forward to trying this new-to-me sushi spot.  What can go wrong?  A lot.\n\nUpon arrival we were seated at the sushi bar, and immediately noticed that a boy around the age of 10 was seated alone next to us.  I wondered where his parents were (this was at night, and I thought it was strange to leave a child alone where liquor was being served), but really didn't think it would be an issue.  Mistake.  It quickly became obvious that he could not be unsupervised.  Disruptive.  Food everywhere.  Impossible to ignore.  I am not exaggerating.  Ick.  This is not McDonalds - where are his parents!?  My friend mentions this to our waitress not once, but twice.  This is when I expect one of two things to occur:   1) we would be offered different seating, or 2) a manager would ask the parents (who I realized were dining separately at the complete other end of the sushi bar - WTF?) to bring him to sit with them so as not to disturb others.  Neither of these things happened. \n\nIn the meantime, we have a pear martini (excellent), yellowtail sashimi (OK, not great) and attempted to enjoy a crabcake (blegh).  It was not fresh at all.  It tasted metallic.  Inedible.  I know what crab should taste like, and this isn't it.  \n\nBack to our young diner - my friend, realizing that this kid is a nightmare, approaches the parents to explain the situation.  Why did he have to do this?  Because nobody on the Pure staff would step up to deal with it.  At this point I am very irritated (and hungry!).  Oh, it gets better.  My exasperation is interpreted by my friend as annoyance or maybe embarrassment that he spoke with the kid's parents.  No, no, no.  I cannot explain this for some reason and now everyone is aggravated.  Oh joy.  The waitress chooses this moment to offer to bring us something else to replace the crabcake, but I was pretty much over the whole experience at that point.  Scary kid, creepy food, my friend is annoyed with me and I really just want to leave.  I cannot get my credit card out quickly enough.  Get me out of here - that year-old hot pocket that is lingering somewhere in the back of my freezer is sounding pretty good right now.\n\nOur waitress was extremely apologetic, and didn't charge me which I thought was nice (thus additional star).  However, some things you can't make up for.  Pure, you left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Ok......now this has been the best sushi spot so far since I've moved here!! The setup inside is good for a late night hang out in the bar section and the dinning area is open inside and outside. The sushi bar is decent as well. The service is solid. The hostesses at the front are really polite and accommodating. On Friday and Saturday nights it can get a little busy but the wait has never been to long. I've never waited for more than 20mins. \nThe menu is pretty robust. They have a large selection of rolls and seafood dishes that are amazing.... I recommend the shrimp & scallop entree. You won't regret it. I have tried many rolls and non have ever been a disappointment. \nAll in all I would have to say that this is the best sushi in town. If anyone can top this spot please let me know!! GO SUSHI!!!!!!
1,"Even though I don't speak French, I was able to participate in their Sunday afternoon class. I was recommended to this spot, and later found out it's attached to a Vedante Center. The vibe was kind of like Baha'i center; there was a cooking class and it smelt scrumptious, a kid's yoga class has just finished so there were people of all ages. The instructor demonstrated to the class what she wanted us to do, and would quietly explain finer points in English to me by the mat, which was loaned to me and all the props I needed. Occasionally she interjected English into the class, and was incredibly gentle.\nTr\u00e8s bene!\n\nAddendum; on their schedule, they list when they have bilingual/English classes. I went back to their open class (bilingual) and left with my body purring like a well loved cat"
1,Great bagels with amazing flavored cream cheeses. I love the honey almond cream cheese on French Toast bagel. Husband swears by the lox spread. Good prices & friendly service!
0,"Worst Bar Bathroom in Madison\n\nIt's upstairs in a back hallway. Supposedly, the lesser known louvre. More like the louvre that not even the owner knows about because it's f-ing disgusting. There's one stall for an entire floor of intoxicated chicks. The door kind of closes, so you have to meet it just right with the door frame or it'll only close partway, making it look like nobody's in the stall. Not good on period nights.\n\nThe toilet isn't fastened to the floor, so it tips when you sit your drunk ass down. No idea why no one got around to bolting the toilet to the floor. Seems like a given, but, hey, this is the worst bar bathroom in Madison. Anything goes. Seriously, though, customers shouldn't be able to tip your toilet like a friggin' cow."
1,"I have heard wonderful things about Sushi Kee for some time now. We finally made our way in and we were not disappointed. We ordered the edamame, shrimp tempura and the murphy roll. All items were very flavorful and something we would order again."
0,"Can't complain about the food it was quite good. But alas they have one of the big \""no guns\"" signs by the front entrance. This establishment has to go on my don't give them my business lists. \n\nThe sad part is the food is really great. But I have my principals and if they called the police on one of my buddies for carrying a firearm my friend would actually go to jail. \n\nSo be warned."
0,"Stay Far Away From This Place!!!!\n\nI have visited a couple of Urgent Cares in the Charlotte/Fort Mill area, but this was by far my worst experience.  I arrived and was seen rather quickly.  I was in a lot of pain, but thought that I was off to a wonderful start.  This all changed once the door opened.  The technician who took my vitals was very cold and aloof.  By the time that the nurse practitioner Pamela Pritchett arrived my blood pressure was through the roof, which it NEVER is.  Mrs. Pritchett walked into my room in a huff.  She slapped her computer on the table and rarely made eye contact with me.  She was very belittling and condescending.  Both the technician and the nurse practitioner made me feel like quite the inconvenience.  I will never return, and cannot recommend this facility to anyone.  There are several other offices in the area that can least provide a shred of human decency and compassion!!!"
1,"USA USA USA!!!\n\nLove this bar, the only real downside is it is too small. \n\nLocation - right next to Waverley and great stop off for any pub crawl through town. The service is top notch and the guys take time to talk to you - and they know their stuff. Really good range of beers - local and North American. Good whiskies also, not just the usual stuff.\n\nGreat music also, you could easily lose  afew hours in this place \n\nFood looks great too, but I still haven't tried it..."
0,"Clearly comfortable with their location.  The presentation was 3 stars, the food was 2 stars, the price was 6 stars.  The soup was weak and for $15 a bowl...you have to at least get that right.  I would not recommend this restaurant."
0,"Be warned that their policy to refund your credit card is 5 days. I will never use this company again,"
1,"Holy cow, this was the fastest smog check I've ever done. It takes longer to fill up my gas than it took to get smogged here, no lie. They have 3 machines so the likelyness if having to wait is slim to none. \n\nI was there for about 4 minutes TOTAL and 2 of them was waiting for the machine to charge my card. The guy was super nice and friendly. They are at a new location which now has bathrooms. Apparently the previous location didn't. \n\nNot only do they give 90 days to rescan for free if needed but if you go on their website you can get a coupon (that you can just show them on your mobile) to bring the price down to $13.99!!! $19.99 regular price isn't bad either though. \n\nANYONE who needs a smog check needs to go here! No questions asked!"
1,I cannot wait until sir hobos open up again. This place has the best breakfast anywhere!  The skillet are to die for. This service is as good as any diner in Chicago.
0,Saleswomen is extremely rude both times I have been there. Will not return.
0,"This is the worst UPS store I have ever been to. The gentleman in front of me only needed to buy one stamp and the employee asked him if he had cash or if he could buy anything else because it was costing him more to run his debit card than  he was making on a stamp sale. When it was my turn, I was shipping out a prepaid box. The rep asked me to buy my own tape to close the box, because he wasn't making any money on my shipment! Needless to say when you are providing a service to people, this is not the way you bring in business. I always ship with UPS but this has made me second guess my choice."
1,"Our dining experience was great. I do think it is a little over priced but the service from Marco and his crew was exceptional. And on a quirky side note, the butter they serve with the bread basket is phenomenal. So much so that I my sister in law ordered some from Amazon that night."
0,"Just sent this message to Channel 13 Action News Reporter.\n\nHello Ms. Darcy Spears.  Sorry to bother you via social media.  I would like to know how to go about submitting a story concerning my experience at Centennial Toyota in Las Vegas.  I brought my 2008 Toyota Sienna in because the door did not open when I pulled on it.  This is a $50K vehicle as it is fully loaded.  I had to make a deposit to have the car looked at.  Three days later I was told my car door was fixed.  Toyota showed me where they charged my warranty $2200 dollars for the door repair.  I tested the door knob and found that the door was the exact same.  Toyota gave me an appointment to have the door rectified, but they tried to charge me the deposit again to have it looked at and threatened to charge me to have the door handle fixed even though they got $2200 from my warranty company to supposedly fix the problem that I brought the care in for.  When I asked what they fixed for the $2200 they got from the warranty company I learned that it was unrelated to what I brought the car in for and I did not authorize random work.  I went in for the door handle and the door handle alone."
0,"This is a Crowne Plaza? This is more like a standard motel 6 that costs 3x the amount. I mean I got a king size office suite and it has a tiny tube tv in it. I didn't even know these things still existed outside of them at Salvation Army. Bathroom is blah, I'm questioning cleanliness of bed sheets and room in general. Staff at front desk was really nice though."
1,"The place looks  clean  and well taken cared of !!! I had a man do my pedicure and he has to learn a lot my skin next to the nail were hurt by the clippers and the vile .  But I think I should of asked for Julia I will do that next time  , no more man on my feet"
0,I can't say I agree that the food is good. This was the first time we tried this place. The cost versus the quality doesn't match up. Can't say I'll ever order from here again. And the people on the phone seemed confused at best. I was on hold for 3 minutes and never told how long my food would take. Very disappointed.
1,"My insurance company listed Airpark Collision Center as a repair option and I'm so glad I called. Great work, great service and great people - I couldn't be happier with the entire process. If I need any body work in the future there's no doubt who I'll call."
0,"Meh describes this place well. We were wandering around looking for a relatively inexpensive dinner on our first night in Montreal. We walked up and down Rue St Denis and had lots of options, but settled on this place. It was pretty simple, sandwiches, some Italian dishes, salads, nothing out of the ordinary. I got a salmon and cream cheese club, which was primarily cream cheese and bread. They were out of the cous cous special, and one of the bottles of white wine we wanted. \n\nThe service was fine, the one or two French words I know coupled with some pointing got the message across. Getting the check took a while, which seems to be a common thing with every place we went. Maybe it's just part of the Montreal restaurant culture? Don't know about that, but I do know I'm not going back here. Choosing this place was based entirely on an empty stomach and a nearly empty wallet."
0,"This had to be the worst service I have ever received in Vegas. I was sitting at a table with a few attorneys and I can speak on their behalf when I say just how terrible this place was. Our waiter was extremely rude. I won't get too into details, but he never smile. At one point he filled one of our cups and spilled water all over the table and then simply walked off without trying to clean it or even apologizing. At the end 2 of the girls wanted ice cream so they ordered pistachio. When it came out, they each tried a scoop and had the same facial reaction. They told him it tasted more like green tea and it was not good at all (mind you, they were very nice about it). They asked to send it back and to have the vanilla instead - he literallly rolled his eyes and just stormed off. Upon his return he threw it down on the table and walked off.\n\nNow, I know what you are thinking (if you are like me at least). You may read this review and think we had annoying people at our table giving him a hard time, but the truth is, this guy was just flat out rude. I mean from the very start you could tell he was having a terrible day. But the thing if, if you go to an expensive restaurant such as this, you should not have to tolerate the wait staff treating you like this. \n\nNow onto the food.... hopefully, if you come to this place, you receive someone more friendly and more like your typical waiter/waitress in Vegas! Two people had the braised short rib which was delicious. I really wish I had ordered the same! The price was great too at $28. I had the Gnodi which were basically some sort of cheese balls ($20). They were okay, but they were quite cold which made it a little less appealing. I would advise against ordering the gnodi. And lastly, my other friend had the DOCG pizza which 3 of us tried at the table and none of us liked. He ordered it because they named it DOCG, so it should be good right? Completely bland. He kept taking the short rib from one of the girls and smearing it on the pizza lol. If you order that pizza, you may need to order a side of short rib :p"
1,"My husband and I have eaten at great dim sum restaurants in San Fran and even great chinese eateries around the country but Great Wall is definitely a place that should not be looked over in the greater Phoenix area. The place it ALWAYS jam packed for dim sum on the weekends so don't be surprised if you have to wait a while for a table, but well worth the wait for sure. \n\nLast night we decided to try their regular menu and we were not at all disappointed! We actually have the dinner for 2: 1 egg roll and crab puff per person, wonton soup (a HUGE bowl with the best wontons i've ever had!), sweet and sour pork, chicken chow mein (again my husband and I both agreed this was the best chow mein we had ever eaten) and Fried Rice. It was BEYOND enough food for 2 people and was $9/person :) Everything that came out of the kitchen looked delicious...it won't be the last time with go there for dinner....though we LOVE the dim sum too:)"
0,"Located in old town Las Vegas...\n\nEverything is old, yet cheap here.\n\nDon't like how you must have a reservation here in order to park free in their parking lot."
1,"I hade also had the Quebec Lamb waou it was yummy deliciously made. The restaurant is amazing, with a very friendly and professional service. Happy dining!"
0,"For another city this restaurant might get a higher rating, but compared to other buffets in Las Vegas, the Buffet at the Aria doesn't match up. Especially compared to the Bellagio next door that has the same price for lunch and dinner, the Bellagio wins without doubt.\n\nThe main reason I went was for the oysters on the half shell, but beware: the oysters were unfresh, dessicated,  and had such a strong fishy taste that I was unable to swallow them. Also they looked as if no one had touched them on the ice which made them the more unfresh. The sushi was palatable though I suspect the Aria does not hire a real sashimi chef with the sashimi being unevenly cut. \n\nThe prime rib and the flank steak were good, although they were not seasoned particularly well to meet the standard already set by the Bellagio. As the newcomer on the block, the Aria does not make a case for itself; the Bellagio does a better job and has much more selection for the same cost. The Aria buffet resembles a cafeteria and the interior is somewhat claustrophobic.\n\nThe saving grace of this buffet is the beautiful presentation of its desserts, this could make it worth it if you are a dessert fan, although the selection is definitely less varied than that at the Bellagio. \n\nAll in all, the Aria was digestible (apart from the oysters), but it cannot compete in the competitive buffet scene of Las Vegas."
1,"Beautiful beautiful lounge. It's inside a giant chandelier inside of the Cosmopolitan. There are lots of seats and booths and it's always fun to sit down, sip a cocktail and people watch. The night we went the top level was closed off (we went on a Thursday around 2 am) bu we were able to sit in the middle level and just chill and enjoy the view. \n\nYes, its over the top, yes, its overpriced, but it's inside of a giant beautiful chandelier!"
0,"My family and I travel out to LV at least once a year and one of our \""traditions\"" has been to pick up food from this location at least once during our trip...this was our favorite location out of all the locations we have tried in Nevada and CA up until yesterday.  We were unsure if it was just an off day or if they have just gone completely downhill.  Our small order for 3 people took forever, even though we did not order any special requests.  On top of that, the lady who took our drive thru order had no idea about the menu...she did not even know that there was a foot long hot dog and tater tots special for $3.99 and ended up overcharging us.  Good thing I looked at the receipt.  The bf cautioned me to use cash since my debit card has been over charged in the past.  So either this location recently had a turnover in staff or it has just sunk downhill.  \n\nThe food was just meh aside from taking longer than usual to prepare (3 cheeseburgers, coney, tater tots...no shakes or smoothies, but many factors could have gone into that.  This was very unfortunate, but we are no locals, so our absence will not hurt the establishment much."
1,"Wow. Love this place. We had the soul food plate with chicken fried chicken, collared greens, and beans on rice. We could have drank the white gravy from a cup it was so good. The service was fantastic and she answered all our questions. (We're as pasty white as it gets and this one of the first soul food experiences for the family.) One tip: the portions are huge so you can share. Highly recommend."
1,"Im a believer, no offering required. I had Jersey Mike's  Original Italian. Great flavor good size. I have not tried any hot subs yet but my guess is cold subs is their specialty. If you eat a giant sub be prepared to dvr all the sports games and reality shows you lie about not watching."
0,"I love the goofy chicago shit on the walls, and the haphazard menus that dont make any sense all over the walls. It is the first place where I actually felt like it could belong in Chicago. The guy that owned it was obviously from a big city back east, just by looking at him and talking. \n\nThe food though? Not so good al."
0,Your drivers are good people. Your dispatch is an utter embarrassment to customer service.
1,"I've wanted to try this place for a while. The ambiance is beautiful. It spins faster than I anticipated. If you're fearful of heights stay away.\n\nThe food was good. We started with the pear salad. It was delicious, but small. My friend and I were concerned about the sizes of the entrees but we were in for a plesant surprise. I had the scallops and my other had the short rib canilloni. Both dishes were substantial and delicious. We ended with the cobbler and fried zucchini bread. The bread was wonderful. I would go back and recommend it. FYI - don't park in the Chase garage. They don't accept their validation."
0,Beware if this location. These guys here are lazy.  They were nice enough to say it was OK for me to show up right at closing.  To tell me a few minutes later that there was a crack in my radiator and fluid was dripping (...it was brand new radiator fluid dripping out) and that due to liability issues were unable to work on my van.  I took my van to my mechanic and not a single thing was found to be wrong.  Wish I could give this location a zero!  I will never recommend this place to anyone
0,"Has to be the worst Hertz, I have ever been to. If you are a Gold member don't expect to be able to use a upgrade or expect them to care. I choose the location because it was close to my office and needed a car after a wreck. I called ahead and still waited in line for 30 minutes. I finally got the car and it was new Altman that smelled like a ash tray. I did not have time to bring it back so dealt with the stinky car for 18 days. Return process was shorter wait and assumed it was over with. 15 days later I get a Gold notice that my return was completed. I thought they didn't except gold service and was told their system did not support it. We to my surprise the added a $100 charge for outside carwash. What, so I called and ask what it was for and also what they charged my card twice. Now I am out $200 for a carwash. I was told by the rep that the car was dirty, smelled and has dog hair all over. I would have to talk to the manager when they get in tomorrow. After being a Hertz fan for domestic and International travel  for more that 15 years it might be coming to a end. I do not recommend this location, gave it one star because I had to for the post to submit."
1,"yummy yum yum! So many flavors and they add new ones every week! Puts other places to shame that have 5 or so artificial flavors. Yogurtland taste fresh and healthy! The location is nice, lots of restaurant choices in walking distance or after a movie at Chandler Fashion Mall. \n*the only complaint I have is the tip jar. I don't see why we should be pressured to tip, when we served ourselves... all the employee does is collect our money."
1,"I love this place! I've come with my family, met friends there several times, and I've even brought my ultra-picky relatives a time or two! The food is always absolutely incredible, and there really is something for everyone.\n\nI am not a breakfast person, but I love breakfast at Heart and Soul! I'm a vegetarian and really prefer fresh, organic food, so it can sometimes be tricky to find good stuff at other restaurants. Not here! Although there are several things for me to choose from, I can't seem to get away from the veggie omelet. It's got yummy seasonal veggies inside, along with oh-so-good goat cheese and the perfect amount of spices. It's served with blue/white/sweet potatoes - fancy and tasty! There are lots of other things on the menu that others at my table have tried and loved, but I'm always so wrapped up in my own flavor sensation that I can't say I've really paid attention to what they've ordered, only their, \""OMG! This is soooo good!\"" noises. :)\n\nI've been to H&S for lunch several times and can't seem to move beyond the salad menu, although there are lots of other things. I never order salads at restaurants because I hate ordering things I can easily make at home, but they have such a nice combination of fresh things and tasty dressings that I order one every time. I have had the grilled veggie sandwich once, though, and although it was pretty good, I was back to a salad on my next trip.\n\nI have read a lot of negative reviews regarding service. Although there have been times when things have been a bit slow, I've never had a problem with going up to a staff person and asking for what I need. They get busy, so I understand. It's a small-town-type place, though, so the owner/chefs are super friendly and love to come out and talk when they have time. I think that, if you're not accustomed to a diner-type atmosphere where wait staff is made up of your own neighbors, you might see it differently.\n\nI will continue to go to Heart and Soul whenever I can swing it. I'd love to see this place stick around for a long, long time!"
1,"These are GREAT Burgers, Real meat and they have different spicals every week.  I love the freash sweet potatoe frys."
1,Little Saigon is the best Vietnamese food I've had in the Phoenix area.  The restaurant is family owned and the food is great.  I suggest the Rice Vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp.
1,"I've been here twice. Both times for lunch on the weekend.\n\nI liked the menu here. They had more than I expected. One thing that we had and really enjoyed is their pizza! It's homemade with fresh toppings. Took a little longer for our food because of the pizza, but the server let us know when we ordered. Also, ordered a calzone on our second visit. Delicious! I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad both times. It had lots of chicken coated with a choice of mild, medium or hot buffalo sauce. I ordered medium. Very tasty! \n\nService was very good. I couldn't decide what kind of drink I wanted. After talking to the bartender, she made something for me that wasn't on the menu. Food was hot. Bartender and server attentive.\n\nPrices are on par with most places that are dive/sports bar. Drinks are good. Decent pour.\n\nGreat place for a relaxed lunch!!"
0,"I lived in Negley Court apartments. The good was that it was relatively economical. The bad: the place was quite dirty, the garage run down (water leaks and filth) and overall the place in pretty bad repair. \n\nThis is all stuff you can put up with. What was amazingly unpleasant and very unprofessional was the property manager (Mary Blocher). I found her to be generally lazy, rude and highly uncooperative. In the end it was even impossible to get her to do a handover when I moved out (there was nobody there to take the keys). Ultimately I had to contact her manager to get the deposit back. He claimed that she'd been put on a different job, alas, as I can see, she's still working there. Easily the worst property manager I ever had the misfortune of interacting with.\n\nAnd yes, I did not want to post this review while I was still renting for fear of retaliation."
1,"When arriving from NY do the following.\n1. Get off the plane\n2. Drop your stuff off at the hotel\n3. Proceed promptly to the cab stand and go to the Peppermill (the lounge portion)\n\nAnything short of that is inexcusable.  This place is the beginning middle and end of any good trip to Vegas.  It will get you in the Vegas vibe immediately and rejuvenate you after a long night out in it's warm bosom of semi-circular banquettes.\n\nThe drinks are dead on and the black gown clad waitresses are divine.  Their Manhattan is one of the best I've had anywhere.  The food in both the lounge and the restaurant comes in significant portions.  We usually order the Nachos in the lounge which feeds 2 guys just fine to accompany post travel drinking.\n\nMost important of all, this place has a quiet kitschy mirrored wall pink neon class that connects the present to the Vegas of old."
1,I have been dreaming about the cupcakes and cookies that I bought the other day.  I am making another trip here very shortly as should you!
0,This buffet wasn't that awesome. I think Bellagio's buffet is better. The only upside is that they have all you can drink (beer & wine & lattes/coffee) and a pretty good dessert selection (I highly recommend their pumpkin or banana gelato). I wouldn't come back. It's definitely overhyped.
0,"NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY!  This place could have had regular weekly customer, but instead, they blew it. I take my child to a therapist for medical issues next door there. Unfortunately, she is an older toddler who is not potty trained and needs changed frequently.  There is no bathroom at the small therapist office.   I thought I would check out the restaurant and use their restroom.  Upon walking in, I was accosted when I asked to use the restroom.  This is something I am not accustomed to.  Very rude.  They said I had to buy something in order to change my small child  in their restroom.  OK, fine, I buy the expensive lunch.  Then I proceed to wait quite awhile to get it, then I notice it has been sitting for some time and the counter person just never picked it up.  I take it home and eat the lasagna and salad. The salad is very good, the lasagna is average.  Kind of disappointing for the price. The place was so busy, I had higher hopes. I complain to my husband about this and he says it is probably because Sonio's is in a bad part of town with street people around.\n\nNow this week, i desperately need a bathroom again. I plan on buying something,  per their rule.  There is a bad storm outside or else I might try to change her in the parking lot.  As I walk in I am asked about getting a table and say i need to use the restroom first.  This time I am rudely told that the restroom is closed because when they have deliveries, the restroom is closed.  Say what????????????????????  What restaurant is so bent on not letting people use the restroom, especially when they have a kid?   This is so rude and insensitive.  There are no other restaurants except across a busy intersection.  I dont understand why the employees dont show a bit of friendliness or understanding.  Doesnt anyone have kids?\n\nI wont go there again.  They dont seem to care about their customers at all.  My customer service experience was completely negative."
1,"Stayed here for a fun long weekend of golf, baseball, and Final Four March Madness. We over spent, the location is good, the staff was very good to us, but they were not worth over $200 a night.\n\nThey have a VERY small ugly pool behind the place...it has one table and a couple of chairs...that's pretty weak in my opinion.\n\nRooms are good, microwave, fridge, sink for bar, pretty good set up for us....\nYMMV"
1,"Hmmmm, who doesn't love some delicious ice cream on a hot summer day? Especially ice cream as good as this?\n\nTheir flavors are extremely thick and full, letting you know they use the best brands for their ice cream. \n\nThis isn't the fluffy, light ice cream you want after a 2-course meal. This is the creamy, fatty and rich ice cream you want when you're looking to satisfy that sweet tooth craving. \n\nI'm definitely making it a goal of mine to try every 1 of their flavors. Now if only Madison could get the hint and give us spring, I'd appreciate it very much."
0,Just recently went to the Frank Caliendo show which was great!! We (two couples) got there early hoping to get good seats. Much to our surprise they told us to sit close we had to spend $$60.00 in booze or beer per couple to sit up close. That seems like they are promoting DUI's. That is a lot of alcohol!! Very disappointed in The Improve for this action. Our seats were ok and we had partial blocked views so the Improve is probably not for us anymore.\n\ncb

1,amazing paninis.\namazing homemade lemonade.\namazing atmosphere.\nreally good place for brunch.\n\nand who can beat the lovely euro feel of old montreal?
1,4 stars b/c I wish they were AYCE\n\nOsaka's is one of the original sushi joints in Las Vegas. Their rolls are very delicious but they do get costly b/c they don't offer all you can eat. When my bf and I go here our bill is usually $100+. Osaka's is good if you don't want to be gluttonous.
1,Good selection of sandwiches for a great price. The bread was very fresh and scrumptious. They also have the best pepperoncini!\n\nThe place was huge and clean.\n\nI will be going back for more for sure.
0,"Something's were appealing, like ground beef for $1.88 lb in what appeared to be a 10lb roll.  That's a bargain I can't find anywhere else.  \nThe bulk items are kind of a turn off.  Here I'm thinking people are sticking their hands in to nosh on a few goodies and sure enough, some guy sticks his hand in and pulls out two gummy candies.  Clearly he is mentally challenged and couldn't read the \""DO NOT....\"" sign that's applied to every few barrels.  \nI was surprised by the variety of products they carry.  \nThere was what appeared to be a massive selection of coffee on the wall but I didn't get a close up view.\nI picked up some Greek yogurt, Bolthouse Farms beverage, Kefir, and a couple other items which were priced much lower than any of the other Valley grocery stores.  Not knowing the types of meat cuts and prices I couldn't compare WinCo to any of the area grocery stores.  \nOverall feeling, I am not going out of my way to shop here.  I\nI was also surprised to learn they have limited payment options too."
1,"After getting screwed over by another so called \""pool\"" specialist, I found Pathfinder.  Roger was so easy to deal with.  He was not pushy at all or trying to sell me stuff that I didn't need like other pool people had.  He gave me options and let me decide what I wanted to do.  They were very prompt in coming out and getting stuff done.  He gave me a fair price to drain the pool and start it back up again.  I like them so much that i'm entrusting them to install a new filter for me as well.  If they do as great of job on that, I'm going to give them the additional star.  UPDATE - Work is complete and they did an outstanding job.  Pathfinder gets 5 stars and I have already recommended them to others."
1,"Good Indian from a person that doesn't know squat about Indian food. Great butter chicken. I love spicy food but they make everything flavorful without any spice.  That is great because I love exposing my kid to all sorts of different flavors and cultures.  I can easily and safely give him anything from the buffet and not be even concerned that it is crazy indian spicy and will kill the kid.  He loves indian food. So if you ask Elliott- This place is NUMBER ONE, 5 stars.  \n\nI think its just fine.  The lunch buffet is the best deal.  I only go during a buffet can I eat like a PIG."
0,Wow...what a ridiculous experience. This studio called me twice to confirm and to make sure I get there early. My appointment was for 10. And I didn't get out of there till 11:30. The shoot itself took like 15 minutes. I wouldn't even mind the wait but no apology or discount was offered. Not very great customer service.
1,"Wow, A+ ice cream. Really fresh ingredients and call me crazy but ice cream tastes better with a metal spoon. I plan to frequent this place. If you've never tried TARO ice cream get in there and try it before its out of season."
0,We used to like this place but not a good experience this time.  Our server was great but the food tasted old and just slopped on the plate.
1,"Is it so wrong to give Green Valley Ranch extra stars because I got to stay here for free?  Probably not.  \n\nThe bedrooms and bathrooms are spacious, and the room I stayed in had a flat panel tv, which is probably standard at all hotels on the Strip.  Green Valley is a nice alternative if you're trying to stay away from the hustle and bustle of Sin City.\n\nYes, I went here with a boy, many, many, many moons ago.  And, Ma, if you're reading this, we slept in separate beds."
1,"This is my new favorite HT. It's almost always crowded, but it's worth it!\n\nThe selection is better than most HTs, and the prices are even better. How the price can be different one HT 3 miles away from another HT is beyond me, but I've definitely noticed. \n\nOther differences are that this location seems to be better lit than some of the others, and everything looks bright and clean. Who doesn't love shiny??\n\nThe HT in Matthews has a better local produce selection, but higher prices on everything else.  You can't win them all, I suppose."
0,Wasn't too impressed with their food. We tried a variety of their rolls and nothing stood out. Sakana's still the best!
1,"Yummy sushi!  We finally found a place to eat sushi in las Vegas - \""The Island Sushi and Grill\"".  It's sooo good and it's all you can eat.  The ahi, tako and crab poke are addicting! The hamachi kama is to die for! All sushi are made to order and the desserts are good.  The malassada sundae is very delish, reminds me of Hawaii...."
0,"I should have read the yelp review before booking, not sure how this place can get away with charging a daily \""resort fee\"" of $14.95. This Motel is far from resort quality with terrible customer service from check in to the Bait Shop and the bartenders and waitresses. Not to mention we were there from thurs-Sunday and the smell of vomit never left the bar area, it didn't smell fresh it smelled like it had soaked into the carpet to remain soiled forever. The rooms are extremely out of date which could have been forgiven do to the low cost of the first two nights and the fact that you aren't in your room very much when in Vegas however when considering the rest of the poor experience we will never return."
0,"I am warning anyone that loves their Pet to NEVER go to this hospital for any type of service for your pet.  I took my dog there to have some simple fatty cell lumps removed and it was a disaster.  They offered us a discounted rate if we also had our dog's teeth cleaned.  Well, my dog got SEPSIS (blood poisoning) from them infecting him while they were cleaning his teeth and my dog passed away 48 hours later.  I loved my dog for 8 years and he was healthy and happy prior to them infecting him with this deadly disease.  I had a necropsy (autopsy) done to prove their negligence and offered this to them and they provided me with no apologies and tried to do everything they could to deny wrong doing.  I am now fighting with them over reimbursement for my loss since that is all I have left.  I fear that I am not the only one and the public needs to know what the doctors and their non-caring staff have done to pets in their care.  Please do not make the same mistake I made!!"
0,I honestly would rate them 0 stars . I have a brand new 13 accord with 8 thousand miles on it . Brought it to this wash and as they called my name to get my car I inspected it and there was a 6 inch scratch mark on my lower right bumper . Probably from there stupid car wash machine malfunctioning. I told the guy what the hell is that scratch and he denied that the machine did it I was like are u serious . And he goes it's from going over a curb in the parking lot . Last time I check going over a curb would leave scratches on the bottom not on the side of a damn bumper which was one single straight lined scratch not multiple . Anyways I'm never going back here again. Worst customer service ever . Don't recommend this wash to anyone . Messed up my 32 thousand dollar car that isn't even paid off yet.
0,"Sadly,  I really don't know what to make of this.\nDecided to bookmark this place based off of some of my Yelpers on my friends list, because they posted some yummy pics of their sticks and shakes.\n\nHOWEVER.....my experience was anything BUT satisfying. My special someone and I decided to get dessert after our dinner date. We both opted for the gelato sticks. $4.95 each. If you want to add toppings (chocolate dip + topping) it can range from 0.50 cents to $1.00 whether if you want half dip or full dip. \nMake sure you check in so you can get 15% off per stick, per person. Even with that discount, our total came out to around $12 including tax. \n\nWe got:\n***1 coconut gelato stick with half milk chocolate dipping + rainbow sprinkles.\n***1 cappuccino gelato stick with full white chocolate dipping + pistachio topping. \n\nMaybe we're spoiled with Yogurtland or anything similar to froyo....but this was kind of pricey for a small dessert. Plus it wasn't great either. Just tasted like a normal popsicle stick with toppings. Too sweet for my liking. \n\nOnly reason why I'll ever be back is to try the shakes. And that's a BIG MAYBE."
0,"Found out today... another couple we are familiar with attended this same event .\n      Guess what...They weren't asked to preauthorize anything, nor were they asked    for their method of payment. \n      SO MUCH FOR CLAIMING THAT IT'S (THE B.S.) POLICY!!!"
0,"Food was bland, service at best was mediocre.  Angie was the only manager and she was the only positive aspect of the dinner. Server had no knowledge of food or drinks. Hostess, chef expo all on their phones.  We work for Batali restaurants and if we ever tried this we would all be termed. Surprisingly they are still open. Angie (mispronounced) manager got us our drinks, informed us about the food. If it wasn't for her I seriously doubt we would have been helped or satisfied at all. Granted it wasn't crazy busy and it was a Friday night, sorry a week late. But we figured it should be heard. We are leaving two stars for the busser and manager who really tried to help us in the bad date night, they deserve a five star rating for their efforts. \n\nAs for the food the ahi was salter that a bowl of salt. Ramen broth was like water, more flavor in top ramen, noodles were over cooked as well. Chicken skin tasted stale. Chicken was good but it was cleared before we were finished. Just not good. We will stick to raku and monta in China town. \n\nWe hope that mgm or owners (who ever runs the venue) of yusho listen because this could be a cool spot."
1,"Went into Best Buy after a dismal experience at Walmart. We were looking for a camera, which also happens to be carried by Walmart. Antonio was helpful and informative, explaining the differences (both pros and cons) between similar cameras. Best Buy had the same camera at the same price, with a more friendly, knowledgeable and professional employee.\n\nI've had similiar experiences with Best Buy in the past when purchasing cellular phones. I was able to upgrade my phone, through my wireless provider, at Best Buy. The same product at the same price, but a much more customer friendly employee. I will continue to utilize Best Buy for all of my electronic needs. \n\nCustomer service is huge for me when chosing where to shop. Best Buy has never dissappointed and always seems to put the customer first. Too many other places don't place enough emphasis on customer service.  I will definitely return to Best Buy."
1,Great service and a nice ambience. The veg spring rolls were fresh and perfectly cooked. The vegetable kung pao and chicken schezwan was good but could have been more spicy. The spiciness levels are really low though the items were mentioned to be spicy in the menu card. I would recommend this place for their service and reasonable price.
1,"To be honest, I was a little dismayed when I opened their brunch menu and was faced with a list of 'complicated' choices. None of those straight up 'Two eggs with bacon and sausage' fare here, nope.  \n\nI tried to find the simplest thing to order, but everything looked equally elaborate and foreign. I was lost. So I settled on what sounded somewhat familiar, which now that I think of it, I must have once had for breakfast on a plane trip: breakfast burrito.\n\nWhen it arrived shortly after - this huge log of of a thing in the middle of a plate - my suspicion only grew larger. And then... all negative thoughts in my head went silent. The thing tasted fantastic! I couldn't believe it! I think my pupils dilated with excitement with each bite. \n\nI would have given the place five stars if it had not been for the slow-ish service when we got there. I think we sat idle without a menu, without any water, for a good 5 to 10 minutes before a waitress noticed us and signaled, \""I'll be with you in a sec.\"" Granted, the place was busy and they seemed understaffed.\n\nEverything else seemed fine though. The decor is hip and feels so 'right at home' with what the St. Henri neighbourhood is becoming. The white and blue landscape painting hanging on their wall is a great pick and very gorgeous. The price is comparable to what you'll be paying at popular brunch places in the Plateau. Definitely will drop by Mariani next time I'm in St. Henri."
0,"The inside area is very dirty, the service was slow, and the menu was misleading. Don't order the home fries, it's a vegetable medley. The server never came back for our check so eventually we had to use cash instead of card."
1,"great locally sourced menu.  The food was tasty and the cocktail selection was really cool.  They like mixed drinks here and they make them strong.\nHad the fried chicken and biscuits with st louis slab cake for dessert.  Yummy!  \nI really likes the feel of the place, very relaxed and groovy.  I will be returning and recommending this place"
1,This place is conveniently located near my house.  Its one of the nice places nearby that you can eat/hang out and isn't a chain restaurant.  The pizza is thin and crispy like I like it.  The restaurant is a pretty decent size place with PLENTY of TV's for all the sports addicts.  The patio seating is nice as well but its a shame the only view you get is the parking lot.
0,"I was really hoping to love this place. A) I love Greek food, B), I am a big supporter of family run businesses and C) we have 2 locations very close to our house.\n\nBut I was slightly disappointed.  The prices seem high, the service seems unfocused and overall, the food was just ok.  Nothing fantastic unfortunately.\n\nAnd one thing that I thought was highly weird is that the drink station is out in the open, like a fast food place.  I had waited for 5-8 minutes for our server to notice that my iced tea was nearing empty and ask if I needed a refill, but nothing.  So, I proceeded to get up myself and walk the 10 feet to the drink station directly across from our table to refill my drink and I was blocked by 2 different servers, who directed me to go sit back down and they would call my server over.  They were nice and friendly about it, but it was just weird to me."
0,"It was expensive, pretentious and just a fair meal.  There were 6 of us and every dinner ordered the waiter said \""oh that is the best one\"" - it was heavy and presentation was just ok.  I preferred Olives at the Belagio, Mesa Grill at Cesears, Lupos at Mandalay Bay and Nuvos at the Palms."
1,"Best Christmas tree selection and the guys helping are so helpful and nice. They give a fresh cut and assist to the vehicle. Janis, the owner is really sweet and supports the community charities. Thanks!"
1,This place may be out of the way for many Las Vegans but it's right in my neighborhood so it's a convenient 5min drive for me to get tapas as good as Firefly at a more reasonable price. \n\nI wish they didn't remove the pineapple and salmon skewers but the bacon wrapped dates are to die for. The paella is tasty and not too sauteed. Mojitos and sangria are pretty good as well.
1,"Jeff cut back the Christmas light install with his kids, tore himself from the Cardinals/Cowboys (Go Cards!) game and came to our place to do a Sunday evening re-key for a shed with lost keys.  About 75 minutes, as promised, before arriving just before dusk.  Completed the work in the dark.  He also monogrammed the new keys with the shed's initials.  Nice.  \n\nHe said he gets several calls a week from Yelp*ers.  Go Yelp*!"
1,"I just moved literally a block away from Mamma Mia's and my boyfriend has to eat pizza a minimum of 3 times a week so off we went to Mamma Mias. We ordered the 2 pizzas and a soda for $4, a great deal! I believe that only includes cheese pizzas but the guy offered us a topping so we chose mushroom. Usually when I order mushrooms on a pizza they come super soggy and really greasy. The mushroom on our pizza at mamma mia's was perfectly cooked! The only complaint I had overall was that our crust was a little overcooked. I think this was due to him having to put our slices in the over a second time for the mushroom's though, as everyone elses crust looked fine. \n\nI say if you like NY style pizza and want to get a meal for under $5 definitely check out this place."
1,"Decide to drop by at Chinita for lunch and I am glad I did. The food was deliciousI had mango margarita and Chinita sampler and ?Camarines al mojo de ajo and it was a great choice, love it. The bar tender was nice and warmth and friendly. The owner personally  greet with me. Will definitely come back again! Great place to eat will definitely come back again!"
1,"Very easily one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. 4 of us had decided to go with their Sunday brunch since I had read pretty good things about it on Yelp. Let's get the qualms and cons out of the way before I start praising the place.\n\nQualm 1- You pay first before you start waiting to get seated. There are two lines for payment - normal guests like you and me, and the diamond VIP guests that pay a lot of $$ to get that status. Very often, people don't read the signs and line up in the diamond line. After you pay, you wait in line. Our wait was about 40 minutes [it would be worth it]\n\nQualm 2 - Our server was a nice and sweet middle aged lady. Problem with that was that she was slow and very not sensitive to our plates piling up and our drinks always going empty. We started playing tetris with our plates to make room for new ones.\n\nQualm 3 - The 'galbi'. The 'Korean beef ribs' were mercilessly overcooked and straight up jerky. Whoever crafted the sauce also made it wayyyy too concentrated and extremely salty. There was so much sauce it was almost chalky. I attempted to take one bite, could even cut the meat off the bones, then left it to be picked up.\n\nThe great things:\nI love the design of the plating and presentations. Mini-pots to hold the heated foods, lovely little plates and cute bowls for the small, chilled dishes. I will agree with some folk that the cute presentation and plating of the foods make for difficult carrying, as only a few dishes would be able to fit on your plate. But you know what? That means more exercise. Walking back to the buffet lines = more calories burned. \n\nThe short-rib eggs benedict was AH-MAY-ZEEENG. The short rib was tender and well seasoned, the eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise sauce was just mild enough, but a great mixture to cohesively blend all the flavors and textures together. Sooo delicious. I went back for two!\n\nThey had flat flat flat thing crust pizzas so that the dough didn't take up too much space in your gut. The BLT salad was very tasty and seemingly light. The pesto gnocchi had a very cheesy feel to them yet they weren't too dense or heavy. Very delicious.\n\nThere were 12 flavors for gelato for dessert, chocolate covered strawberries dipped in crushed oreos, dipped in Heath Bar crumbles, and white chocolate covered marshmallows, along with an assortment of flavored fudges. As simple and common as it was, their peanut butter cookie was super duper delicious. You can tell they didn't hold back on the butter, but boy, was it delicious.\n\nFor a $29+tax brunch, I'd say, the selection was very good, the overall quality was there, although there were a few misses on the dishes [i.e the 'galbi']. I saw that there was slab bacon at the carving table that many were asking to be freshly grilled. Something different and new that I've never seen.\n\nI think the Wicked Spoon made its way to my 'must have' list for my 'things to eat when in Vegas'. Loved it."
1,"Vanilla did a fabulous job on my daughter's wedding cake and additional cupcakes for the wedding party..  The cake, filling and icing were superb and the design was exactly what we requested. Their cupcakes are always moist, flavorful and inventive. We were loyal customers at the old location and will find them in Regent Square for our next special occasion."
1,The Smokey Poke was amazeballz!!..#atetoomuchoffhehappyhourmenu\n    I'm not being bias to say he does great Thai and fusion dishes but soon he will have Duck and more awesomeness! !! Got the inside scoop. ....from the man!!!
0,the manger joy is very rude. will not come back here
0,"Walked in to the sight of the hostess and all the wait staff texting on their phones. Bartender said we could seat ourselves. Waited for about 15 minutes- didn't even get waters. There was more staff on hand than patrons, so there was no reason for any kind of wait. Poor service, total lack of professionalism... Went to the Mexican grill next door and had drinks in less than 3 minutes. I suggest going there instead!"
0,"When we first got here on a Monday at 5:30pm there was a long line at the front desk, looked like just 2-3 check-in people, needed to have more.  Have been here maybe 10 years ago, pretty disappointing.  Very crowded.  Went to the cafe for diner and there 10.99 prime rib special.  Not that great, and the smoky smell there and throughout the property ruined everything.  Good room price and location.  Room itself okay except for smoky smell again, even though we had a non smoking room.  Went to MAC king, just ok.  Front desk handed us free pass but you pay 10 for 1 drink min.  Long line so upgraded with extra 5 to get VIP line pass and half price coupon for.flavors buffet.  Show just ok, long line to get drinks.  Next morning went to buffet.  Generally not good.  Won't come back to harrahs again."
1,Excellence in every area!
1,"We had great seats, second row, center stage. The showroom at the LVH is a pretty good venue ( we have previously seen Twisted Sister's Xmas show and Cheap Trick doing Seargeant Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band) the acoustics are nice and there aren't many bad seats. This show is a tribute to rock and roll from the 1960's though the 1980's. Normally that would be a boring cover band performing lackluster music. However this show features musicians from top bands such as Survivor, ASIA, Quiet Riot, Heart, Guns N Roses and Offspring. The show loosely focuses on a team of explorers who come back to earth from hundreds of years from now and find a vault of musicians who play (flawlessly) hits from the 60's through the 80's with full costume changes, a radio DJ and corresponding video. The song list includes includes hits from, The Doors, Jimmy Hendirix, RollingnStones, Queen, The Who, Free, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, The Eagles, Van Halen, David Bowie, Foreigner, Journey, Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams and more. The musicians clearly enjoy themslseves and give their all singing and playing their instruments. The show was 2 hours with no intermission. We recommend this show."
0,"We stayed here this weekend. When we booked we let them know we had children. They assured us the pools would be perfect for them. Well, that could not be a bigger lie of they tried. The pool was so over packed with drunk people that the lazy river doesn't even move. One man even pushed my 8 year old under the most intense waterfall I have ever felt. Luckily my 25 year old saw her in time and pulled her out from being trapped in the current. When I told management, they said there was nothing they could do, that they have a routy crowd because of the concerts they host... So why did you originally tell me this is the perfect place for kids? Also, why does a child drowning not alert the sleeping lifeguard? Oh, and why is their response to my child drowning, \""I can comp you a couple drinks at the pool tomorrow?\"" Are you kidding? Why would I go back to pool where my child almost died? You should also know the Signature's team claims there are not a part of the MGM even though they are called The Signature at the MGM Grand. What a joke. Don't got here. Way over priced and not safe at all. \n\nAnother thing- you're only allowed to park 1 car at the hotel. They tell you if you have 2 to go park the other one at the MGM even though they claim not to be connect."
1,"Last year, they knew me here as the 2am girl. I'd show up almost every other night after working hard and on my way home! :) It was a perk! They gave me some items for free! :D Thanks guys!! I love all the locations!"
0,"Mr. Tara again...\n\nUh, I'll try to be nice here, but this was the most disturbing place I've ever eaten breakfast at. I think they mean well enough but I would never come back.\n\nComparing this to the Dor-Stop is insanity, unless you're saying how much you wish you would have gone back to to Dor-Stop instead of experimenting with trying another place for b-fast. \n\nAnd not sure what other posters are saying but the coffee really did suck. Typical watery crap. The pancakes weren't too bad tho..."
1,"Best Pilates & Booty Barre classes in town. Exceptionally knowledgeable & inspiring instructors, particularly Chandra whose classes I frequent."
0,"I have been a long time patron of Villa Francesca since around 2009. The service has always been hit or miss, but the food was good and reasonably priced. Recently, I visited Villa Francesca and was greeted with a new menu; still the same food, just everything raised $3-$4 in price. \n\nWhen we began to place our order, our waiter said \""Do you guys have any appointments or anything tonight? Because the kitchen is really backed up.\"" We said it was fine and ordered two pasta dishes. After waiting over an hour for my $17 plate, I was disappointed to bite into icy frozen broccoli. The waiter apologized and had it fixed immediately, but that doesn't remedy the issue that I am paying $17 for pasta and frozen vegetables. \n\nAlso ordered chocolate cake and asked for it warm. The waiter brought cold cake and said \""I couldn't bring it hot because when I put it in the microwave, it completely melted.\""\n\nSad to say I will have to say goodbye to this Italian restaurant that I have enjoyed for years."
0,"I was excited to try a new Italian restaurant close to home. It's a cute little restaurant, good vibe, server was friendly. BUT when I asked questions about the menu she was not very knowledgeable. I do not know if I will return to give this place another chance. I wasn't too  impressed with the food."
0,"I've been to this store several times - in the past - and have tried the cheese, garlic, plain and combo bagels.  This location is packed in the mornings with regulars:  cops, locals, many of the people from my neightborhood, including a columnist from the Arizona Republic.   I don't like their bagels.  They're small, bland, and too dense.  My favorite bagels are Costco's cheese bagels.  Second runner up are Fry's cheese bagels."
1,"First off I really like the place. I'm Lao/Thai/French and since moving here to Las Vegas I've been trying to find more of \""my people\"" or something that reminds me of home. This came pretty close and I'm thankful they understand my Lao! Haha! I came here with co-workers this last Sunday and it was a good choice. The papaya salad was a little sweeter than what I'm used to but they scale the spicy for the papaya from 1-10...I asked for 12...I felt like it was an 8. I make all this stuff myself at home so I know what a 12 is...it's the kind that burns your fingertips before you put it in your mouth! Haha! I really like spicy! \n\nAnyway...I ordered Papaya salad, larb moo (pork), and Thai BBQ chicken and sticky rice. Everything tasted great!...but the only reason why I couldn't give them a 5 star is because the portion of sticky rice they served for $2.50 was like a smack in the face for someone who is Laotian! That is the mini handful size I gave to my kids when they were 5!!! C'mon man!!! On top of that the texture of it was as if it has been reheated at least once. It had a super hard center and was wrapped in Saran Wrap to re-steam. Uh-uh! No! \n\nI would definitely go back...but I'll stick to white rice."
0,"Having worked in customer service and as an Administrative Professional for 15 years, I have never run across such complications booking travel!  My December wedding requires lots of flights from the Midwest so I've been trying to use Frontier.  The flights keep changing ...  direct flights be come crack of dawn connection flights (not good considering my little sister  and dad have not ever flown before!), and each time I try to call and clarify things I get nothing but more confusion and smack talk.  Then I attempted to add my cousin's flight to the mix - big mistake!  The online portal is an ABSOLUTE MESS just like the customer service line I've had to call four times now.  I didn't write down my cousin's locator because I made the mistake of thinking they would actually get the emailed confirm sent!  When I called back they couldn't even find her by name ... I had to pull up my credit card statement to prove they charged me for it and in the mean time got nothing but smack talk from the Rep.  Not cool, not cool at all.  I have many, many years more travel coordination to do, it definitely will not involve Frontier."
1,The noodles here are quite good and the sauces are okay. The kung pao chicken with noodles is very good it has a sweet and spicy sauce but could be slightly spicier.  Definitely best noodles I've had outside of Chinatown.
1,"What an amazing hotel! The complimentary breakfasts rock, the rooms are spacious and just perfect! Our room had an awesome side view of camelback from the balcony and the quiet environment was the best. Though it was quite chilly to go swimming, I do regret not swimming in their heated pools during my stay. I would definitely stay here again!"
0,"I ordered the Baja Burger. I said Baja Burger. When the food came, it looked like chicken. I said, \""I ordered a burger.\"" The waitress replied, \""It's a chicken burger.\"" Being the reasonable person I am, I assumed I hadn't been paying attention (which has been known to happen) and wondered to myself why they'd put a 'chicken burger' in the burger section. I mean, I read the description - it said nothing about being chicken. Whatever, it looked good so I chalked it up to me not paying attention and let it go. The 'chicken burger' was delicious. So good. I was very pleased.\n\nThe service was pretty slow, especially after we got our food. The hostess cleared our plates and we waited patiently - for who knows how long - for our waitress to come back by. She finally dropped the check, at which point we waited a while longer - long enough for me to take a leisurely trip to the restroom - before she finally came back by to retrieve the check and run my card.\n\nOn the way to the restroom, I passed the kitchen where I saw the waitress either doing her sidework or checking out others' sidework. Either way, I had my answer as to why the service slowed to a crawl.\n\nOh, and on that check was printed, \""Baja Chicken Sandwich.\"" I checked the menu on my phone to make sure I wasn't losing my mind. I wasn't.\n\nI said burger."
1,Saucy. And nearby. Its convenient that it's so close. I cant stress the closeness more.
0,"The Customer Service personnel are awful. You literally have to chase after them to get some help. They all stand around talking with each other, and ignore the customers. I went there to purchase a dishwasher and a refrigerator, but ended up leaving with out purchasing anything due to their useless employees / customer service. I now purchase my appliances at Lowe's or Sears where they actually acknowledge their customers."
1,"Excellent fresh seafood and service, the bang bang shrimp was out of this world. We were a party of eight, so we tried several different items from the menu; ahi tuna sashimi, Thai coconut shrimp, bang bang shrimp tacos, sir will's fish and chips, corn chowder and lump crab, Chilean sea bass, long fin tilapia, filet mignon, and a couple of their stuffed fish specialties and their kids Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing, the only thing that was just okay was the filet mignon, granted they specialize in seafood not steak, but highly recommended you won't regret it! :)."
0,Gus started out impressing me.  We have been there four times.  Each time got progressively worse.  The quality of the food steadily went downhill.  I do not believe I'll be going to Gus's again.
0,"Probably the worst service I've ever has.  The food might be good, but we've already been seated for 45 min and haven't seen plate one.\n\nIt took more than 15 minutes to get drinks and another 10 before we could order.  The waitress didn't know the kid's menu, so when we asked her a question about it, she said \""ummm\"" and then guessed.  Our two year old finally got so hungry we asked for the \""emergency snickers\"" that was advertised on the kids menu and was met by blank stairs from three different staff members.  One finally went to see if they could find one.  After 10 minutes I asked if we could just get some crackers or something.  They said they had none, but we could order fruit or a biscuit.\n\nAs I am writing this, the manager came over.  When we complained she snickered and asked us if this was our first time here.  She claimed that the food is fresh, so that's why it is taking so long.\n\nBasically, food may be good, but if you never get it, what's the point.\n\nAlso, the music was so loud, our twoyear old spent the entire time covering his ears!"
1,I absolutely love the interior design. I would take any friends here for a night out that is close to home but not the typical dive or gaming bar feel. This place feels snazzy. \nThe us timer service is great. All of the hosts are interactive and make you feel comfortable but not overwhelmed. \nThanks for a superb environment to relax and have a drink.
1,These folks are very helpful and nice.  I have been here with both my dogs many times.
1,"Exciting and fun!\n\nWe walked here from the Elara and it was so easy. No hassle of hailing a cab or driving and trying to find parking. This particular night there was bondage act and I was only able to see a little bit. Too much drinking before hand. *Yikes* The music, from what I recall from last night, was good..dance-able or in my case...head bobbing-able. That's all I can remember. I think cover that night was $25. Pricey but I don't even remember paying... Thanks to my awesome party! \n\n\n-FUN!"
0,"The venue itself if quite charming.  Quite old school vegas while amenities offer plenty of comforts.\n\nHowever, the two older ushers that work there need to retire.  They are grouchy, rude and should be put out to pasture.\n\nOn my 2 trips to this showroom I have heard them insult and humiliate a man who was so large he needed a little extra help to be seated and a latino couple who were having a hard time understanding the ushers instructions.\n\nThere's never a need a need to make people feel bad!  Might be time to consider hanging up you colored blazer and staying home!"
1,I really like the atmosphere of this place. I think they were a little short staffed or something the night I was there because service was a little slow. But they made up for it by treating me to a margarita. Enchiladas with chicken and red sauce were quite decent!
1,"The Post Office.  Under scrutiny by greedy people; appreciated by the locals.  Not many people know that the Post Office is non-profit and not one thin dime of your tax dollars goes to towards it.  Nope.  They make their money from STAMPS.\n\nDig that.\n\nI went in today to mail off a package someone bought from me on eBay and my wait time was all of 10 minutes.  Whether you love it or hate it, I enjoy the convenience.  For less than half the price of the private industry delivery options, I can have my package there in 2 days; lickety-split.\n\nThis afternoon, three out of the four windows were open and all was right with the world.  They're helpful, they smile (when I'm here) and they hire Veterans (a lot of them) -- so, what's not to love?"
1,"Went on a Friday night (the online reservation system was very useful) and had the Olive appetizer (which was worth the 5 dollars just for the amazing homemade sourdough bread that comes with it), the spicy chicken and the whitefish. Everything is carefully thought out, balanced, and with excellent quality ingredients (same goes for the cocktails - we had the sazerac and rhubarb3). Would definitely be interested in going again in the winter and seeing how their menu changes with the season."
1,"I'm not sure what else can be said about MIM that had not already been said by others. If you're into music you have to come by if you're in the Phx area. It is $18 for adults, but they give this really cool audio guide to use while there which helps a lot. The museum itself is very large and ultra modern. Make sure and visit the artist gallery on the first floor. Also jam with others in the Experience Gallery too."
1,"Best spa experience I've ever had, without a doubt.  I've been to a dozen spas out here, but I've never seen any reason to write about any one of them. First off - best massage of my life. I've recently started training for a marathon, so the stretching included with the Signature massage was absolutely perfect. Not so much that I felt like I was exercising (that would defeat my purpose), but just enough to make my sore muscles melt. The facilities at the Montelucia are amazing. I really love the Moroccan theme - unique and vibrant, yet as serene as it should be. Everything is clean and new and it smells delicious.  I LOVE the idea of the \""whisper room\"" - a dimly lit space with loung-y beds, especially after a couple of pitchers of sangria out by the pool. I see Camelback Mountain everyday, yet the view from the terrace was breathtaking. My friend and I lounged outside for hours eating and sipping cocktails by the 85-degree heated pool. \n\nThe only drawback is that it ain't cheap, even with the \""local\"" discount. Even though my spa day cost me more than the monthly payment on my BMW, I can't wait to go back. Perhaps after I find a second job."
0,"I never would have opted to dine at Margaritaville (despite being a Buffet fan), but went with a group and didn't really have a choice in the matter. \n\n1. The food I ordered was good. I had a fish sandwich and fries and coleslaw. I enjoyed it. \n\n2. The show that they put on is SO damn hokey that I stared in open-mouthed horror/amazement. It's a good place to take kids; however, it's not my cup of tea. Mostly I felt terrible for the performers who had to put on the show every hour.  The show involves performers on stilts, costumes, singing along, clapping, and a water slide.  And topped off with balloon sculpting (if that's what it's called) hats for select patrons. \n\n3. We had a friendly server who was patient with dealing with a large group (9 people) for dinner. She did well except for some issues splitting up the bill. \n\n4. The food and drink prices are pretty high and I'll assume part of that is due to the fact that it's Vegas and most of the food/drink there is costly (in my humble opinion). I thought it was overpriced, but it's Vegas so I'm not surprised or complaining. \n\n5.  One member of our party had a rare (medium rare, maybe?) cheeseburger and was the unlucky recipient of food poisoning a few hours after we left. There was no doubt that was what it was from. It was not from another restaurant, nor was it the flu. Based on that alone, I have to go with one star."
1,"Found this treasure because it's on my way to and from work and what caught my eye was the price.  $30 for an hour long massage!  I was a bit hesitant at first because of the name: Foot Massage and Reflexology.  I wasn't sure if they'd be spending an hour on my foot and if that was the case, I wasn't too interested. Anyway, after calling them and confirming (several times) that it was a whole body, I decided to give it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  They first soaked my feet in hot water and then the whole body massage began.  They were attentive to the areas on my body that were more stuff than others. I didn't have to wait long.  The only fly in the ointment was while there are private rooms, its more like private cubicles.  You can hear whenever noise is made.  I've gone twice and I'd go again. ($30 for an hour long massage in Las Vegas?  Heck yeah!  Coming from California, I haven't seen prices that cheap...ever!)"
0,"We booked our room at Treasure Island over two months in advance and upon checking in on Friday, we had no reservation on the books. I contacted hotels.com (where we booked the res) to find out that everything was all set on their end, and despite a written confirmation that we had paid in full and had a reservation, the staff at Treasure Island was completely unconcerned with my issue and offered no solutions at all. Their attitude towards the whole situation was appauling, and after talking with three staff members, I finally was put in touch with a semi-helpful woman who at least offered to see what other rooms they had avaialble for the evening. \n\nAfter an hour of this ridiculousness (expecially frustrating after a long travel day), they miraculously found our reservation and I was sent upstairs. \n\nThe rooms were wonderful and the amenities at the hotel were great. I enjoyed the entire time I was at Treasure Island with the exception of any time I had to interact with they completely unhelpful staff. \n\nAdditionally, we requested a late check-out (by 2 hours, not exessive) and they could not have been more rude about the request before denying it. I kindly reminded them of my check-in experience; however, this tactic proved unsuccessful as well. \n\nThe incredibly enjoyable weekend I had in LV had everything to do with the people I was with, and nothing to do with the hotel I chose to stay in. We certainly won't be returning."
1,"I tried this place in San Diego and they have it in VEGAS! After partying it up at XS, stopped by here to pick up some Adobada (spicy pork) tacos, carne asada fries, & a large horchata, hustled into the hotel room and started devouring these foodgasmic tacos. (Just sprinkle in some lime juice & hot sauce... tastes best mixed in with their green sauce). They use fresh potatoes for their carne asada fries and their meat is so tender & smoky.... OMG best thing ever especially when you need some hangover food haha."
1,"Every time I have been to Casbah for lunch, brunch, or dinner, the food has been great and the service has been impeccable.  Sure, I've had more exceptionally delicious and unique meals in Pittsburgh, but Casbah has Consistent Awesomeness down pat.  Just get a reservation ahead of time.  Also, the desserts are mandatory!  \n\nThe duck confit gnocchi is smashing-- it's a nice balance of slightly sweet and very savory--and my favorite is probably the Casbah Double-Cut Pork Chop: super-yum comfort food.  The short rib ravioli is some pot-roasty Goodness, and the long island duck is another great choice.  \n\nA nice surprise here are the great happy hour specials at the bar.  Try the Boyd & Blair cocktail and the sangria."
0,"I thought the food was good, BUT.....  The place is too small and cramped.  I like to read the menu. I don't want to have to ask the waitress.  I wanna read what is in all the rolls before I decide.  All they have is the names of sushi rolls and nothing else.  I gotta be a sushi psychic/guru to make an educated choice.  And FINALLY, for the first time ever at a sushi restaurant,  I WALKED AWAY HUNGRY.  Too expensive for the small portions.  Waitress was nice.  Won't be going back."
0,Meh.  Seems like they're trying to do too much.  Nothing really jumped out as amazing.  Won't be back.
1,"\""Svelte Carries a Briefcase\""\n\nI went to this branch after missing the turn on my way home from the gym. It's located in a messy strip mall on Rainbow near Flamingo--a ratty, most depressing intersection if ever there was one. \n\nI pulled into the dirty lot and found a spot by my lonesome, knowing full well that when I returned some poor clown would be jammed up right next to me since it's wrong to park where someone else is not. As I walked to the entrance some Lee's employee was busting his ass carting out a dolly full of booze for some whining bitch who resembled an emaciated version of Skeletor. As I walked inside some hawtie employee immediately started checking me out but I ignored her. My mind was focused on one thing: single malt Scotch, and wow did they have a good selection; in fact, this Lee's was so large they had a good selection of everything. I hemmed and hawed for a time before selecting a bottle of Jura Superstition.\n\nI noticed hawtie at the checkout counter waiting to ring people up but there was a svelte African lassie with a briefcase kinda sorta maybe in front of me. She turned after sensing my masculinity and gave me the thrice over, smiling as she mentally undressed me and pictured our children. I nodded and smirked back. Hawtie asked African if she could help her but African said she was here to set up for a wine tasting. How nice.  \n\nAt the counter hawtie was on her cell having like the most important phone call evarrrrrr but managed to multi-task by ringing me up and checking me out again. \n\nOutside I noticed a decrepit van parked right next to me while also noticing no one else in the lot. I shook my head. I give up trying to understand people. I climbed into my ride and drove away, my hand resting on my purchase with undying love and affection."
1,Great portions and good food. Stayed for a week near by. Probably ate here 4 times in a week. The southwest Cobb salad is beyond delicious. Great happy hour 4-7 everyday. Highly recommend.
1,"Fabulous as always!! Never disappointed with my facial! Relaxing, enjoyable, great information on the latest skin care, AND I leave with perfect, beautiful skin! What could be better...!!"
1,"Breakfast was excellent, really on my top five lists of best breakfast joints anywhere.  The corned beef hash is great.  Portions were generous.  Service was attentive and friendly."
0,"Plenty of Cougars and Black dudes, it's a porno waiting to happen. \n\nThe $7 cover was ridiculous and I wasn't going to go in...that is until the doorman gave my friend and I (a lady too) a deal. (NO, I didn't have to do \""the dirty\"" in the parking lot or put anything in my mouth! Believe me this place isn't worth that.) \n\nI went up to the bar to get a Stella - and got my ass grabbed three times. By whom? I don't know; it was too packed to tell. (Obviously people like this place, though I'm not sure why...)\n\nI was lucky to get a parking space right away so that was a plus, but I don't plan on coming back, so the next guy can have it."
1,Best way to watch a movie! Food and drinks were fairly priced and so yummy. Seats were super comfortable. I will defiantly be going back again and again.
0,"DO NOT WANT\n\nI can get an idea for what this place emphasizes and it's not service.\n\nLet me list our problems with our visit to this establishment:\n\n1) Eternal waiting: our server took his time to make it to our table. The staff took their time delivering bread and drinks to us. \n\nOnce we ordered, it was at least 45 minutes, possibly longer, before our entrees were delivered to us. We discovered somehow that the kitchen chose to first serve a large group that arrived later than we did. No apologies, no visits from the manager, no \""make ups.\""\n\n2) Dishonesty: While waiting outside we had noticed the prix-fixe menu stated the rib eye was a 12-oz, while the rib eye a-la carte was 18-oz. That was reasonable for the price (which was roughly comparable); some in our party chose the a-la carte and others chose prix-fixe.\n\nWhen the entrees finally came, to our surprise there were no differences in the size of our steaks. When we inquired of the waiter he stated that the steaks were the same size regardless of prix-fixe or a-la carte. When we then pointed out that if we had known, all of us would have ordered the prix-fixe, he did not respond.\n\n3) Food: the best part of the meal, honestly, was the fries. The spinach souffle is nasty. And having been to Mastro's, Ruths Chris, Lawry's, and Flemings, the steak is overpriced for its quality. \n\nEasy to say we aren't coming back and I hope this review drives foot traffic elsewhere."
1,"Todd English P.U.B. was just what I needed to have an escape from the escape of Vegas.  Sometimes, the glitz and the glamor is fun and all, but geez, sometimes a girl just needs a good beer.  Thankfully this place is here because as a craft beer lover, I have a refuge from all the cosmos and sparkling champagne.  I was quite content in my jeans and t-shirt, just being me.\n\nThe food is very good.  Not over the top, but casual food.  I had the lamb sandwich from the carvery.  It was very tender and the apple chutney and blue cheese fondue made excellent sauce choices.  There was a variety of bread to choose from and challah seemed like the best choice.  The sweet potato fries were very crisp and hot too!  Oh, on a whim I had an oyster shooter.  A oyster with cocktail sauce swimming in vodka and a splash of beer sounded like a perfect idea.\n\nThis place really shines on beer though.  Although it is not the ultimate craft beer bar in the world, it is different from all the other bars in Vegas.  You can get flights and I was impressed they had cask beer."
0,"If you are on a tight budget - the Monte Carlo is probably one of the better bargains on the strip. From our stay it seems to be popular with overweight middle-aged White people, and frugal Asians. And luckily for me at their gym - seems neither of those groups work out!\n\nGiven my recent experience though - I will probably spend a few more bucks next trip and stay at Vdara or similar (discount rates via Jetsetter/Hotels etc). I knocked this from 3 to 2 stars for uncleanliness. Details follow....\n\nThe Dirty Discoveries:\n\n- Bathroom floor: dirty, especially under the sink. I mentioned once to room service, but it was never mopped. I rubbed around a towel to verify it was dirty, and not just the color of the floor\n- Dirty Washcloth: the second day I was delivered a washcloth with multiple large, bright red stains in it, that looked like fresh blood. Made me think they don't bleach their towels enough. Unfortunately it was right on top of other towels on the rack. Those all went on the floor, unused.\n- Found half a condom wrapper under the desk, in the far corner of the room, next to the wall (thankfully, no condom, and unfortunately too small sized for me anyway)\n- Found a pill on the floor, next to the bed, while checking around to see what other goodies we might find. Googled it and it was a birth control pill, and not one that any of my girlfriends' take. And, unfortunately, of no use to me (being male).\n\nPrevious guest - whoever you were - when you leave pills behind - please leave me some of The Good Shit. Thanks.\n\nWe ended up leaving the wrapper and pill on the floor, to see if it would get cleaned up. They were there our entire stay, until checkout. To be fair - we didn't call room service and tell them about it. But, I wanted to gauge how often/well the floors were cleaned before I performed any calisthenics on the floor. Needless to say we decided it was better off to wear socks and avoid touching the floors.\n\nOverall I thought it was kind of funny, minus the bloody washcloth, but my girlfriends' were fairly unimpressed. I've stayed all over Vegas, and in this price range the MGM Grand was similar but cleaner. But that was 9 years ago.\n\nIn Summary -\n\nPros:\n+ cheap\n(I paid roughly $115/night for 5 days = $585 total. I've read other folks found 5 night bargains for as low as $300. For $300 I'd give this place 3-4 stars)\n+ No taxi line, ever, even peak evening times.\n+ Beds were decent for a cheap stay.\n+ Great, free gym, very clean, new equipment, that nobody uses. Very friendly and helpful gym/spa staff. The gym alone would be a deciding factor in staying here again, were the rooms clean.\n\nCons:\n- Hallways to room were worn down, dirty\n- Room was very dirty - see above.\n- Checkin lines looked insane most of the time I walked by. Luckily when I arrived (on a Tuesday) it was fairly dead. I waited maybe 15 minutes total. Later in the week looked light it might be painfully long in line.\n- Only tried eating at \""The Buffet\"". Food was overall very low quality, in all of my guests opinions, for $25/apiece. I'm more of a quality than quantity guy, but we wanted breakfast food.\n\nProTip: Didn't try their other restaurants, but we found out we could have eaten at The Buffet for roughly $10/person by calling Tix4Tonight."
0,"Seriously, why did I not read the reviews on this place?  It would have saved me heart ache. Layover at the airport; 1 and only time visit. Ever.\nReasons to go:\n1) Sheer eating option default: Fox Sports bar, Cinnabon, Pizza Hut, news stand that sells snacks, & a California Pizza knockoff at a kiosk near the restrooms.\n2) No lines. There's a reason.\n\nReasons to avoid:\n1) The food wasn't bad, but I paid $9.26 for a hot dog, carton of bloated wrinkle fries and a bottle of water. The value was terrible.\n2) Nathan's name smeared for life w/ me. Never had a Nathan's hot dog before but heard friends swear by them. Going in to this experience I was expecting a treat, not a value ambush. Food wasn't bad but it was no where close to good."
1,"Anything you need for your bike come to this place! Kenny is the man! Cool guy with an awesome godly attitude! everyone who hangs out there is respectful, welcoming, and also praises the lord. If you dont need work done on your bike they hold a Bible study on tuesday if anyone is interested give them a call for more information about that. Anyone is welcome"
0,"This location of Applebee's was disappointing. \n\nWe stopped in for a quick dinner.  It was during their happy hour (3-6pm) so some of the appetizers were 1/2 off.  We wanted to try their chicken quesadilla. It was full of chicken, bacon and cheese.  Actually this was probably the best part of dining here.  \n\nFor our meal we split the chicken fajita rollup with french fries.   A long long time ago, this used to be my favorite thing to order here.   Boy have times changed.  It really wasn't great.  The french fries they served with it were horrible.  My body dehydrated after eating one because of all the salt they dumped on them.   I had to drink a lot water after one french fry. Needless to say I didn't eat anymore. \n\nService here really lacked.  I think our waiter/bartender just rolled out of bed.  There wasn't any sense of courtesy or personality.  Sorry Applebee's but I think you dropped the ball...  and it rolled away."

0,"Cute concept, but very mediocre. We went into this restaurant hoping to find some good mexican food in Gilbert, but were disappointed by the food. We ordered the fish taco, clam chowder, and oyster. The clam chowder and oyster were both below average. The oyster was warm and sort of gross. The clams in the chowder were chewy. The fish taco was average at best. Hard to justify eating here when Joyride is right across the street..."
0,"Good Lord, is this place overrated!  Anyone from the Northeast or mid-Atlantic could name about 50 Greek Diners that serve up breakfast favorites with better quality, larger portions and much lower prices 24 hours/day! I feel so sorry for people in Arizona who don't know how they're being ripped off. The fact that this place ONLY serves Eggs Benedict on Thursday and ONLY serves steak and eggs on Sunday is a pathetic joke. There is NOTHING on their menu you couldn't get at Denny ' s for a much lower price. What you're paying for at this place is fake cool minimalist artsy atmosphere and nothing more."
0,"I've visited this establishment twice, once for dinner and more recently for their reopened lunch buffet. For dinner, the food was okay, but the service was severely lacking. It took forever (about 2 hours total) to order our food, get water and refills, get our food and finally pay our check. The butter chicken was so-so. The aloo gobi even less remarkable. The 2 kinds of naan were too doughy. Despite this mediocre experience, I was willing to give their lunch buffet a try, especially since the wifey was curious to experience their cuisine. What a mistake that was... First of all, the price of $11.99 is at the high end for Indian lunch buffets, and this place is the exception to the rule that you get what you pay for. The selection and quality was downright pathetic and frankly embarassing. Ok, to be fair, it was still better than our abysmal experience at Sherpa House (in Golden, CO) but that is setting the bar extremely low. There were a whopping total of 8 hot trays consisting of items such as onion \""pakora\"" (basically onion ring fragments), orange chicken, daal, chana masala, goan fish curry, lamb curry, paneer masala, and (non-Basmati) rice. There was also a small salad bar section and kheer. There was a surprising lack of classic staples such as mango chutney, samosas, Tandoori chicken, any kind of chicken curry, or saag. Although we enjoyed the fish curry, it could not make up for the lack of selection and quality of the rest of items. The garlic naan was so-so. It was simultaneously too doughy yet too hard and dry on the bottom. The kheer was the worst we've ever had. It lacked cardamom flavor and contained numerous clumps of rice. At least this time around, the service was half decent. The only other mitigating factor was they were running a $2 off promotion, although we had to specifically ask for the discount to be applied. That being said, the fact that this place garners stellar reviews is a real head scratcher. Perhaps, restaurants located in the (relative) boonies are held to a lower standard. Who knows? As for me, when I rate a restaurant, I don't care where a restaurant is located. The food is either good or it isn't. It's either a good value or it isn't. Unfortunately, this place is neither."
0,"This used to be good. They changed their menu last year, for the worse. Very few veggie or fish options. Really poor selection for happy hour. Service the last 3 times has been dreadful, slow, unhappy servers. Unlikely we'll go back unless we hear of great changes. It was like eating in Scottsdale - very unfriendly, over priced and mediocre."
1,"Friday nights are the busiest. Also there are coupons for 3 games that u can get from south point. The coupons for 3 games and 2 pairs of shoe rental was around $17.50. The facility is fairly clean for a location that deals with lots of kids. The drinks at the lounge are little pricy, but late night happy hour rates are pretty cheap, specially for drunk bowling. \n\nI did notice that there were some glitches in the software that was tallying the score, but it only happened for one game. This could be an issue if you a competitive person like me. :-)"
1,"I took a wrong turn in Charlotte yesterday. Who hasn't? I ended up by Lupie's. I knew it existed but didn't take the time to stop in. The exterior can deceitful, especially if your used to the ubiquitous patina of most Charlotte restaurants. The food: amazing. Ask for the specials. There's always some seasonal goodness of the day. The beef in the chili is flavorful, and no fatty grit. I also spotted a member of Charlotte city council dining there, so you know it's a good spot."
1,What a beautiful location! It's actually very much like the Venetian in Macau.\n\nThe shops are beautiful and spread out. Even the jewelry stores make you feel like you should stop and take pictures.\n\nThere are about 27 restaurants and if you take your time you will find some real great locations.\n\nHave fun! You won't be disappointed.
0,"We went on a family trip and my father had not been to Vegas in years so we gave him the grand tour of all the hotels.  While we were browsing I saw this really pretty patisserie.  I thought to myself... why not check it out! \n\nFor the full review and pics go to http://www.kats9lives.com/2008/07/beautiful-on-outside-but-lacking-taste.html\n\nWow, what a wast of money.  I looked and looked at the baked goods but nothing popped out at me.  My sister went after I did and she walked out scoffing at what they offered as well as the prices.  Okay I know we are in Vegas and things tend to be pretty expensive... but that does not mean you should pay a lot for bad tasting food! \n\nThe only reason I wanted something really bad was to put it on my website and since the store looked pretty I wanted to give it a try.  I was keeping an open mind and giving it a chance.  I wasted $10 for a bag of 6 or so mignardises.  They were bland and had a gritty texture.  I almost gagged eating this.\n\nSo not worth the money! It is pretty to look at but do not waste your money here.  There are many bakeries 100x better than here!"
0,"We requested to schedule an estimate for a repair via their contact the he of their website in mid-November, based in a referral from a friend. We didn't get a response for well over a week. When we did get a response it was by e-mail asking if we we're still interested in an estimate and if so to respond to the e-mail. We responded that we still needed an estimate. After waiting a week for response we called and were told that some one would call us the following Tuesday or Wednesday to come out and look at the roof, but never heard from anyone. We called this past Monday and left another message asking for Richard who does the estimate to call us back and received a call asking if anyone ever reached out to us. We still haven't heard from anyone to schedule and complete the estimate. It's been a month since we originally requested the estimate. If this is the response when a new customer is interested in hiring a business, we'll look elsewhere."
0,"Just came from Brooklyn Pizza in Wesley Capel, this is the first review I have written but I think it's overdue.  We have gone to Brooklyn Pizza since it opened in Wesley Capel and before that the one on Rea Rd.  They start off great, as good as pizza can be  here in the Carolina's.  Then it begins, the short cuts start.  This time we noticed how chewy the crust has become.  Of course, they are pre-baking the crusts then covering them with whatever the customer orders.  I understand when it's bonkers crazy you have to find ways to get things done quickly but you had a good thing going and now we are out the door, looking for another \""NY\"" style pizza place.  They seem to be opening one a week somewhere within driving distance.  Don't cut corners guys, don' t cheat the loyal faithful customers by counting the pieces of pepperoni slices like I heard one of the pizza maker guys say to a new guy one night.  Give us a good pie at a fair price and we will come back.  By the way your pizza is one of the most expensive around and just not worth it anymore."
0,"Finally made it back to My Mother's here, this time joined by Jackie C. & Mike C.\n\nThe two dining rooms here are cozy and comfortable, and the menu plan isn't great but it's passable.  We all three ordered burgers this time, mine with potato salad and both of theirs came with fries.  All the food was ok but the service was very slow, for one thing.  We arrived to a nearly empty restaurant just a little while after opening time (way before noon), yet were warned by our server that our burgers would take about 20 minutes, and they did take at least that long.  (She brought us out some warm bread to hold us over, but that wasn't what we wanted to eat, especially along with hamburgers!)\n\nWhen the burgers finally arrived, two of them weren't made as ordered and the (different) staffer that served us didn't have any idea which one was to go to whom either.  Service after that wasn't good either.  I had to flag down someone to ask for some more napkins and also later for our checks (which also were wrong) when it was time to go.\n\nLunch pricing generally over $10 if you get either a beverage or their Salad Bar (only one trip allowed, with a tiny saucer).\n\nI suspect this will be my last visit to see Mother.     :-|"
0,"Very disappointed. Our office has gone there numerous times in the past and recently went back after not being there for about a year. The quality has definitely gone down. 2 of the entrees were sent back, my fish tacos were very sparse with no flavor,and the slices of cheesecake that we ordered had gotten alot smaller than they used to be. I don't think our office will be going back there.The only really good thing was our server."
1,"Everyone knows what John Lewis is and what it's all about, so this review if for their wedding/gift registry.\n\nWe chose John Lewis for our registry because you can literally get everything here.  Literally.  From soup to nuts, as my mom would say (though...wtf??).  \n\nThe registry service is good - I phoned up to get all of the \""boring paperwork\"" as the girl called it, out of the way.  A few days later I got a ton of (free) inserts to give people to tell them where we're registered and what the registry number is.  They give you the option of allowing people to donate to charity, which is great, as well as the option to buy gift certificates, and even pay into the honeymoon provided it's booked by a certain company.  \n\nThe best part of it all (according to The Man) is the voucher for two free coffees/teas and two pastries while you shop.  The sugar and caffeine was definitely needed.\n\nWe arrived at the store reasonably early on a Saturday morning, knowing that the place would become pretty hellish by mid-day.  We got all of the relevant instruction, was told which departments could provide us with additional advice regarding table ware, got our little scanner, and headed on our way.  \n\nThe scanner was a borderline nightmare, not all items could be scanned and had to be keyed in, and not all codes keyed in properly.  Some of the items which should have scanned, didn't, and some items didn't seem to have any scan/code reference at all.  Basically, you just have to go in store to really *see* the things you're registering for, but then you need to polish everything up (and add and subtract items) at home, online.  I have no idea how people did it before the internet, it would have been even more of a nightmare.  \n\nIt's not John Lewis' fault, though.  They provided the best service they could, but it was just a bit unfortunate that the fun wedding registry afternoon I'd imagined ended with both of us shattered, with something like a dozen items on the list."
1,"ThIs place has great food, but what really stood out for us was the friendly staff.  They went out of their way to be welcoming and let us sample things that we hadn't ordered. Between the 4 of us, we had the wings, ribs, brisket sandwich, fries, cole slaw, and mac & cheese- all were awesome. The jambalaya, okra, and candied yams were also delicious. I'm looking forward to trying the catfish nuggets and pulled pork sandwich."
0,"What the hell, yelpers! I thought maybe the power of 4 stars and over 700 reviews could compel me to love this place. But I couldn't get past how amazingly terrible this place was! No matter how heavily intoxicated or hungover you are, eating here will still be a mistake.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I came in here with a positive attitude. Who wouldn't be excited for a legit meal that would cost me less than $10 especially in Vegas! So we wait about 45 minutes before we're finally seated. While walking through the restaurant to the back portion (to fit all 12 of us), I noticed half of the place was empty. So I was unsure as to why we waited 45 minutes for a table. Nevertheless, I brushed that aside, retaining my hope and ready for my 4 star meal. We all ordered the steak special. Simple right? Well no, because we waited an hour and a half for all our food. We were starving at this point. And when the food finally came, I just wanted to eat. Except, my knife could barely cut through my steak. It was so well done that the slab of meat on my plate was just hot rubber. I managed to eat half of my meal because I needed something to just keep my stomach as ease. But I was definitely not satisfied. Come to think of it, I don't think anyone at our table was happy with their meal. Some of my friends even went over the gas station next door to buy a bag of chips because of the emptiness Ellis Island left us with.\n\nWhat's terrible here? The service, the food, the wait, the food. Just disappointed all around. But hey, have another star Ellis Island for being such an affordable place for people to come eat and gamble. Just don't expect me to come around again."
1,"I've gotten over some of the weirdness of Noodlehead, and come to appreciate it for what it is: excellent, limited Thai food with some quirks.\n\nSure, they are cash-only. But, they're also BYOB so that's awesome. They do charge a small corkage fee of $0.50/person or so.\n\nThe green curry linguini and pad thai are some of the best Thai dishes I've had in the US. Always consistently and excellently cooked. Never too oily or stale tasting. \n\nAdd a vegetarian appetizer option, and you'll get your 5th star."
1,"Wow!!!!!!!! This is the best pizza on Earth (we went back and forth for a while between Bianco and Cibo and we finally decided on Cibo)if you like fresh ,simple ingredients and great crust instead of salty ,over topped ,greasy chain restaurant pizzas. \nWe have been going for years and between our friends we tried everything on the menu. I  keep having the margherita and it is amazing.The sauce is just right,the fresh mozzarella is to die for, the the fresh basil leaves on top and the crust send me in culinary haven.\nThe prices are good for the quality ingredients ,atmosphere and service.\nThis is the pizza you dream off and can't wait to go back!!\nIt is wonderful to see Phoenix developing its downtown area to satisfy some of our needs to  dine in more unique,quaint  and  urban settings."
1,"As soon as I realized that Plume serves Verve, a Santa Cruz based roaster beloved by my Santa Cruz Alum BF, I knew we had to go during our time in Montreal. As other people have mentioned, it feels like a slice of the West Coast in Montreal - sunny and chill. Plume is in a great location on the edge of Mount Royal Park (and great for us because it was a block away from where we were staying). We came here 4 days in a row, and had regular coffee, espressos, cortados, and americanos, all to our great satisfaction.  can't speak to the food besides a very nice croissant, but with coffee like this, who needs food?"
0,"BUG IN MY FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE TO BOOT!!! I was craving a good salad so my co-workers and I ordered food for pick up in advance so by the time we get there, the food would be ready. I called the restaurant to let them know that even though we ordered for pick-up, we actually wanted to sit down and eat but didn't have much time on our lunch break. The manager gave me such a hard time about it and said that they wouldn't do that for us but would make an exception this one time. When we get there, the manager scolds me and says that \""never do this again\"" by ordering ahead of time! The food wasn't ready and came late. The server was not attentive at all. But the worst part of it was when i was semi-enjoying my tuna salad, i find a BUG in my food! When i show the manager, instead of him feeling bad about it he tells me \""oh sorry but this happens sometimes!\"" WHAT?! I tell him, oh well that's scary, it shouldn't happen at all, if you wash your lettuce right! He gives me a lecture on how the restaurant business works! Thanks but no thanks, I worked in a restaurant for two years and that was NEVER acceptable. I will never go back there again, if not for the BUG in my food, but for the horrible way i was treated. i have never wrote a bad review about any restaurant, but this Pita Jungle definitely motivated me to write one now!"
1,"Encore Beach Club would get 5 stars if it played better music.  They play non stop house music here that blends in some hip hop but yeah. Its a very Euro type feel.  Other than that this place was PERFECT. \n\nI mean Encore is ridiculously nice already but to open this pool party area that has 3 different pools, a bunch of bars, a food section, cabanas, and a sexy pole you really can't go wrong here. \n\nWe were on the guest list because my friend knew someone that worked there- of course always trying to get the hookup anywhere in Vegas and we we got there on a Saturday afternoon all the girls got in free (6 of us) and our one guy friend paid 20 bucks.  Not bad at all considering other pool parties general admission is usually 40 bucks.\n\nIts a very tame pool party tho- drinking beer and just chillin.  There was an area by the pool that we could sit so just because we didn't want to pay 100 bucks for a single lounge chair we weren't assed out. \n\nI had a really good time people watching, drinking, splashing in the pool. \n\nEncore Beach Club becomes Surrender club at night so it seems like a smaller scale of what XS is. \n\nI think Encore/Wynn is trying to take over Vegas people!  They have the best club- XS, amazing Buffet- Wynn Buffet, and now this beach club. NICE."

0,"I wish I had read the reviews on \""Yelp\"" before I contacted them! First of all, in no way I want to discourage anyone from adopting through this organization because they are still doing a wonderful thing!!! I haven't actually even talked to any of the volunteers there but even my limited experience left an unpleasant taste in my mouth and a feeling like I've wasted my time. So, my husband and I decided to adopt the 4th cat for our 1 y.o. recently adopted kitty as a playmate so she would leave the other two older cats alone. We were looking for a very particular type of cat (both looks and personality-wise) and somehow I found their website and one kitten there looked and sounded like an absolutely perfect fit, another one was close. That same night I filled out the application on their website which took over an hour, actually closer to 2, sent it off and then waited 3 long days for a promised phone call. As you may guess, nobody ever called. I did send them an e-mail the next day after I'd sent the application, letting them know about my application and 2 kittens we were interested in. No reply. My husband called them and left a message. I was so puzzled. My thinking was: \""Their goal is to find a good permanent home for a pet, so the sooner they get someone adopted out, the sooner they can go and save another life from the e-list, so it only makes sense that they will try and get in touch with potential adopters sooner\"". On the 3d day, I sent them another e-mail asking if they ever received my application and inquiring whether that kitten was still available or not (the other one had already been adopted and they posted it on facebook). They did respond to my e-mail promptly that time saying they didn't have a record of my application and that the kitty had already been adopted, they also suggested filling out the application (again?). My problem with them is not that we didn't get the kitten (there are way too many unwanted cats looking for love and permanent homes, we knew we would very soon find the one we were looking for) but poorly designed website and poor communication. Maybe it was just my experience and maybe there was a glitch on the website, but after I sent the application I never got any confirmation e-mail like some other organizations send which left me wondering if it ever made it there. After reading some other reviews it's apparent that  there's a problem with it and even sounds like they know about it but it hasn't been fixed yet. There was no response after my first e-mail. The phone call was never returned. And then I turned to \""Yelp\"" and unfortunately I saw a few negative reviews with even worse experiences... We had other options, I mean other cats we could have gone to look at  but we didn't want to create any confusion and give hope to anyone else, so we were waiting for them just to let us know whether that one was still available. It takes maybe 1 minute to write \""no, he's been adopted\"". Maybe I've been kind of spoiled by my experience with a few other organizations where people would always reply promptly to any e-mail and were always there to help you find your new family member and they are volunteers as well (as an example, I had very pleasant experiences with \""Lost our home\"" foundation and \""All about animals rescue\"").\nWhat would have I done differently if  I had read the reviews here first? Well, we wouldn't have got our hopes up when we saw that particular kitty. I would have E-MAILED them a copy of my application, just to make sure it got there or, maybe even, instead of spending 2 hours on the application that may never get there, I would have only e-mailed them and called to find out about the availability of the kitten. I would have called them every day leaving a message. I wouldn't have spent 3 days anxiously waiting to hear from them. But knowing my husband, after reading the negative reviews, he wouldn't have wanted to deal with them. I do love the idea behind their work, I do think it's extremely important to make sure that you adopt animals into a loving suitable home where they will stay forever, but sounds like they at times get carried away with it. In retrospect, I'm very glad we didn't get involved with them. We ended up adopting our little girl through \""HALO\"" and couldn't be happier!  So, if you do decide to adopt from them, just keep in mind that you may not get the animal you have your heart set on. I do hope that your experience with them will be a positive one though, and  you'll be left wondering if I was writing about the same organization."
1,"Holy crap load of meat. Showed up at about midnight which was perfect cause there was no wait and I was extremely hungry from drinking all day. I ordered the Woody Allen (half corned beef and half pastrami sandwich). They brought it out to our table and I thought to myself it looked like they used a whole cow to make this sandwich. Definitely not a place for vegetarians. W/Dijon mustard flowing, probably one of the best sandwiches (That didn't involve me and two strippers, just kidding) I've had in Sin City."
1,"I was very impressed with the patience and all around professionalism of the staff working at this bar, and at the Mandalay Bay in general.  We went to Sapphire for a friend's birthday and had a blast, so I didn't want to call it a night just yet.  This placed looked like an interesting way to continue the party/end the night (even though we weren't even staying at that hotel.  Drunk logic at it's finest.)  We arrived at around 3 a.m., and although the place was clearing out the bartender accommodated our little group, and the few Navy guys who decided to stick around.\n\nA friend left her purse in our hotel, and, while I was in the restroom, she put her credit card in my wallet after she closed out her tab....without telling me....and then forgot.  She spent the next hour haranguing management, security - anyone who would listen - and even blamed the bartender for \""stealing\"" her credit card.  Talk about a buzz kill.  I'd had enough and closed out finding a strange Mastercard tucked into the slot where my Visa would normally be, thus bringing the verbal scuffle to an end.  Throughout her entire tirade, the staff, including the bartender \""in question\"", remained calm and professional, and management even offered some coupons for one of their restaurants when it was all over.  I'm a sucker for a happy ending to a great night out gone awry, and will make my way here for a drink next time I'm in town."

1,Bangers and mash with lots of options. Seriously I think there are about 10 different mashes and they have at least 4 different sausages each day. There's also 4 or 5 gravy options too. \n\nI tried their beef and Guinness (a special) and herby pork. Yum! I had the Moroccan mash and tomato and thyme gravy. Sort of an odd combination but it worked. Plus our meal came with cheery service!\n\nMum's has many local ales and ciders available. They pride themselves on local brews.\n\nAND they have alcoholic shakes on their menu. Bonus points from me!
1,Nice little shop to stop and get fueled.  The iced coffee hit the spot.  We were in unknown territory on the way out of Vegas when we spotted this place.  We were happy to find it.

0,"We been waiting for about 20 minutes,  went inside to check out the place,  big surprise... place has plenty of available tables,  I guess they do this so they can force you to buy the DIAMOND pass,  another $20.00 extra, and you don't have to wait in line... food is ok"

1,"I live in S. Scottsdale and was going to go to Matt's in Phoenix but, checked Yelp to see if I could find a good breakfast place closer. \n\nTo my surprise, I found great reviews about Pesto Cafe and it is just a few hundreds yards from my house.  The shop is in a center that I have driven by hundreds of times and never been in.  \n\nWhen I walked in I was pleasantly surprised.  The cafe is extremely clean and the staff, and customers, were very friendly. I ordered Croissant Breakfast sandwich and homemade iced Chai and both were awesome!\n\nThey make a lot of their items from scratch and are willing to customize healthy options.  They also have free WiFi and a few tables and chairs outside.   I am writing this review as I sit in the cafe and enjoying my breakfast.   \n\nI met the owner, Nathan, and told him I would be sure to recommend the cafe to others."
1,Updated review.  Went back in tonight to try it again. My previous review I guess was noticed cause when my to go food was brought to me(very quick this time) bartender refused to take my card to pay introduced himself to me and apologized for my experience the week prior took care of the whole bill and gave me dessert in my order. I appreciated the gesture and that my negative experience was noticed and rectified. Wings delicious as always
1,"Amazing food, friendly staff, great prices.  I would definitely go back here, hands down!"
1,"Pan Asia is one of Phoenix's hidden jewels. Tucked away in a strip center on 24th & Baseline, Pan Asia is a great alternative to expensive, trendy sushi joints. I eat sushi at Pan Asia at least every other weekend and can say that Pan Asia's sushi is just as good if not better than RA. Not to mention cheaper, especially if you go there on one of their half off Saturday's or during happy hour. \n\nI feel like Norm from Cheers when I go there and the staff is very friendly. Their friendliness is what you should come to expect from a family run restaurant. I especially like John who is hilarious. If you get to know John he will keep you laughing the whole time you are there and will make sure your drinks are never empty. \n\nI highly recommend the Fire Roll, a California roll with a nice sized sauteed shrimp on top drizzled with a sweet and mildly spicy sauce surrounded with Bacardi 151 that they light on fire to create the ultimate sushi experience. For tuna lovers, go with the Sama Roll which is a spicy tuna roll topped with a black peppered spiced slice of Ahi. \n\nHope this review helps and if you are in on a Friday or Saturday night I'm sure you'll see me there. Can you pick me out???"
0,"Yelp 31 Day Challenge #7 /31\n\nIt's NOT about the QUANTITY it's ABOUT the QUALITY!!!! Dear Omelet House didn't you know that by now?? :(\n\nOk maybe I was out partying to long the night before and wasn't really capable of judging the food, but I sure wasn't hangin (cuz I usually don't drink), so there must have been something wrong with what I ate...\n\nSo as we walk in I take a look at the menu and the selection is wow, they have everything u can possibly want, the service was also nice, a lady brought us the menus and immediately asked if we would like something to drink, OH YESSS a cup of coffee PLZ (i need it bad). So I looked at the menu and found my fav dish (which I usually make at home and is WAY better), then I go ahead and order my egg white omelet with lots of veggies and little bit of cheese, mhm talk about not being hungry for the rest of the day...\nAs we wait for the \""goodies\"" to be cooked we chit-chat and the omelets arrive, the \""goodies\"" I thought a minute ago were now chunks of I'm guessing egg substitute, that wasn't even properly cooked (had that yucky mushy and gewy stuff that indicates it needs to be cooked more, hello). Ok the mushy and gewy wasn't even that bad I could still deal with that but it was really really un-tasty like I'm eating old eggs in economy class on a plain, plus the portion was the size of my head & they expect me to eat all that? Buahahaha yea right if u want to call an ambulance, cuz i'll explode...\nSo I picked out the veggies ate those and did my best to try and eat a lil more, I had a big day ahead of me still needed to fuel up a bit, but seriously didn't eat half of half even yea that's how big the portion is and hey I CAN EAT!\n\nPuh I kno I will never go back there, no need to upset my tummy like that, only if I knew I get leftover economy airplane eggs I would of never ever came here.\n\nI'm sorry guys at least u get two stars, if it wasn't for the nice lady serving us I would of prolly gave u guys a one star.. I'm a breakfast person u know & I prolly know all the best spots for breakfast in HNL, and I was NEVER this unsatisfied with breakfast in my life :( sorry...  Maybe lay off the egg-substitute??"
1,"Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got cheese in my tummy.\n\nThis place is very compact.  I felt a bit overwhelmed. There is just so much to look at.  On my visit to PFF I got a 16oz cappuccino and a grilled cheese with bacon. \nMaybe you are asking yourself how awesome can a grilled cheese sandwich really be please read on.\n\nThe cheese on my sandwich was melted all the way through no cold center to be found here.  The bacon was perfectly crisp too.  I was a little concerned about this because from across the deli counter I didn't see any real cook station.  It looks as if they are back there working with a microwave and a toaster oven.  But really I had nothing to worry about because the sandwich came out perfect.  There is some real magic happening behind that counter.  I seriously doubt I could ever hope to replicate that grilled cheese at home with my toaster oven...maybe it's industrial grade?\n\nBonus,  they served it with a little pickle.  \n\nThe cappuccino was also very good. The foam was knuckle deep. Now that's something you're not going to get a Dunkin Doughnuts. \n\nPrestogeorge makes food...but there is only one table inside that could probably seat about 4 people comfortably.  You might want to be mindful of that in case you're looking to dine in.  I was able to snag the table with it being 7 degrees outside...it wasn't too busy and it was Wednesday too.\n\nMy only hang up is that the 16oz drink is the smallest drink size.  I ended up wasting about 1/3rd of my beverage."
1,Dr. Greenberg is very helpful and knows his stuff. The staff are always friendly and the prices are very reasonable if you are cash pay. Definitely would recommend this dermatologist. They have a lot of products and services. Great location. And scheduling is usually really flexible.
1,"In town from Calif for a conference.  Craving steakhouse, and found Keg as one of the highest rated, so decided to give it a try.  Brought a bottle of wine, assuming they can provide corkage.  General Manager, Bobby Price, very tactfully explained to me that wasn't an option, due to liquor license specs, which is surprising, but fine with me.  They stored my wine bottle in their temperature controlled wine cooler.\nEnjoyed an excellent steak dinner, with wonderful wines available on their list.  Prime rib for me, filet mignon (plus some tasty bernaise sauce) for the wife, and the sliders for my 8 yo daughter.  I tried the sliders, and initially thought it was steak, since the meat was very high quality.  Amy, our server, was excellent and attentive, but not intrusive at all.  Ended up going the full nine yards, including a complementary app (bacon wrapped scallops), all the way to a decadent brownie sundae, enjoyed with some cordials (glenmorangie for me, and a generous glass of tawny port for my wife).  When in AZ, we'll definitely plan to come back here, mainly for the excellent service at all levels, along with some of the best steakhouse-style food we've had."
0,We went here to watch a Laker playoff game and enjoy dinner. The food was good but service sucked. After we got our food and one round of drinks our waiter disappeared. We had to take it upon ourselves to get our drinks at the bar. He could have easily racked up a much larger bill and tip had he been more attentive. I was very disappointed.
1,"Very inexpensive fashionable clothes. They carry everything from shorts, jeans, tops, skirts, coats, and dresses. There is a large variety of clothes and styles. Won't hurt your budget."
0,"Some great food, some very old shelf food and some miserable people behind the counter.\nI can't recall a place that had more unfriendly people waiting on you.  They apparently hate working here.  I can't blame them.  They are cramped up inside this small space that looks like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's film Spellbound.\nI once accidentally asked for a certain number year cheddar and they about pulled a gun out from under the counter and shot me.  \""WHAT?!  THERE IS NO SUCH THING!\""  My mistake, I mean 7 year cheddar.  I  had accidentally used the price in place of the year.\nNever a thank you, never a friendly chit chat at check out.  Here ya go.  Ugghh.  I really hate this place but the cheese and sausage are good.\n\nApparently I wrote this when the place was closed for repairs.   Didn't mean to add insult to injury.   But my comments were on the staff not so much the food.   I am hopeful that all of the old shelf food went up in flames.   If I return I won't worry about what I buy from the shelf.   What I said about the staff is true.   I have never seen a smile in this place.\n."
0,"Horrible!! The food was gross, and after bringing me the wrong item twice the server didn't even offer to take my meal off the tab. We were the only table in there and the server messed up everyone else's order too. When it was time to pay he got every bodies tab wrong, he handed me my tab at 8:00 and then grabbed it out of my hand. By the time I payed it was 8:30 and I'm sure it was the wrong amount but by that time I just wanted to leave. Also they brought the birthday girl her cake after most if the party left."
0,We found nothing we were looking for.  The staff was incredibly rude. I do not recommend visiting this store!
1,"Im surprised this place doesn't have a 5 star average rating. Food is by far the best chinese food in arizona, very cozy feel inside, the prices are unbelievabely reasonable for the type of food and service they provide. Owner is Leon that came up to our table a few times to check up on us and offer us a few shots of his tequila collection. He is very friendly and warm personality. We lovvvvve this place, everything is delicous!!!!!"
0,"Very poor. Ordered 1 pizza at 18:20, email received indicating that the pizza would be delivered in 30 - 40 minutes.  At 45 minutes, telephoned the store and was told sorry, internet timing was incorrect, actual wait time would be 45 - 60 mins.  Told it's the next pizza to be delivered, should be 5 - 10 mins.  At least 15 - 20 mins. later, pizza finally arrived.  No apology, nothing.\n\nSo, from being 30 - 40 mins., pizza actually arrived in 60 - 70 mins.\n\nApparently you're required to award 1 star... which in this case is 1 star too many."
1,"This hotel is brand new so the rooms are really nicely equipped.  Great huge size and modern decorating.  I liked the separate living room area that was partitioned off by a screen thing.  It felt like being at home.  I have to admit, at first I thought it was a coffee shop, but it was actually the front desk.  Overall though, it has a really comfortable, fresh, clean feeling and vibe, very nice hotel.  \n\nPool was small but very refreshing.  The breakfast is a miss though.  Very boring selection for \""continental\"" breakfast.  I ended up ordering from the limited breakfast menu every day.  All the food I got there was reasonably priced and very delicious.\n\nI can not say enough about the staff though!  They were so accommodating and hospitable!  I felt like I was part of their family the second I walked in the hotel.  They just couldn't be happier helping me get cabs or recommending a good restaurant or just listening (and caring) about the goings on of my day!\n\nIf I every travel to Madison again, I will most definitely, without hesitation, stay at the Hyatt Place again!"
1,"WeGoGamez is the best. I had a birthday party with some of my friends and their kids. Let me say it was a blast. They really made the party!!! Everyone had so much fun playing games on the Wii and Xbox. They had a wide variety of games to play too, everything for kids, teenagers and adults. I had them at the party for a couple hours and it really was endless fun! I continue to follow them to their events so I can play in the tornaments they have!"
0,I went during restaurant week and low staff attendance.  I'd rather try them again before i make any sore of written review.
1,Just played for the first time in 5 years.  Under new ownership I was told and the course is great.  Excellent shape and very affordable.  This is truly the best value in Vegas and an awesome. Great clubhouse and food.  I recommend for anyone playing golf in Vegas not looking to spend $100-$150 per round.
1,"Love this place. Pizza, pasta, stromboli, wings, garlic knots......can't go wrong with any of them."
0,"This is probably one of the most popular bars in Shadyside.  They have a  great wine bottle special, and decent (not great) prices otherwise.  The decor is really nice and posh...it kind of makes you want to put on a collared shirt.  The food is also decent, though not spectacular.  Definitely a nice lunch stopover though. \n\nThe problem with the bar is the crowd at night.  I mean it is CROWDED.  It's next to impossible to get a drink at the bar or from the wait staff, who are really trying their best but are just overwhelmed with people!   Drinks are made ok...I wasn't overly impressed.  I want to like the bar more, but the crowds keep annoying me to the point of wanting to leave.  Also, the bar is really packed with the douchiest people in Shadyside as well, so not only are you crowded into oblivion, but also it's like a Jersey Shore episode in there...not fun.  \n\nOverall, it's not a bad place.  The drinks and such are done ok, bue the crowd is just overwhelming at all times.  I'd go elsewhere if given the option."
1,"Food still good, but the wait was loong. Upon seating, we were told the kitchen was slow today, which I'm glad they told us beforehand. On a Sunday afternoon, this place was more packed than I've ever seen it. Food was gooood. Pad-see-eww was yummy"
0,"I used to go to Lee's in Irvine, CA all the time as an undergrad and had to make a lil' nostalgic trip on through while in China town. The service at this location was horrible.\n   I waited in line (only one in line) for five minutes before I kindly asked if I was in the correct line. The cashier told me yes, and continued what she was doing. When she was done she said \""... you can order...\"" and wasn't even looking at me or standing at the cash register. I ordered and was charged more than the menu price so I questioned why, she told me because I ordered a large. I pointed out the large was less than what I was charged and she shuttered \""... oh... um, they changed the prices\"" which would have been fine had that had been her reasoning in the first place. \n    It wasn't even busy. And that is the ONLY way I forgive bad service... Guess I'll only go to Lee's in CA"
1,"I don't usually give five star reviews, but this place really went out of their way to treat us well at lunch.  I wasn't expecting much from a place connected to a mall, but the menu was diverse and the beer selections were excellent.  We started with the cajun calamari which was good and then the large and fresh entree salads were brought out.\n\nI ordered a pizza which was brought out by the manager who said it was too burnt for their standards, so we could have it if we wanted it and they were remaking the pizza.  How often does a restaurant have enough integrity to fix a mistake before the customer even asks?  They brought the second pizza later and it was top notch.\n\nSam Adams Cherry Wheat on draft, a good pizza, and superior service.  A winning combination!"
1,"Everyone is awesome! All the employees are always chill and pleasant, Tristan is a beast! PS The Peach smoothie is the best!"
0,"My family has been dining here for years and been able to tolerate the pathetic service since the food is unique.....however, we have noticed a steady decline in what little service and respect you may or may not receive! Don't waste your time with this restaurant unless you like being treated with absolute disrespect!! And if you have any questions about the service or food.. Don't bother asking. You will only be ignored and lied to. The food is good, but not worth the hassle of wasting your time and money to be treated like garbage. The staff is rude, and the mangers are not professional or courteous enough to address any concerns you may have!! All you will be paying for is a horrible experience and a headache to go!!! Stay away!!!!"
0,"Beware..they lure you in with COUPONS.....\n\nOther than my nightmare airport experiences of getting to/leaving Vegas this Restaurant probably was the only other bad part about my trip to Vegas. \n\nIm usually pretty liberal when it comes to rating a restaurant taking into account service, cost, taste, experience, etc. Mr. WiLL is usually a pretty easy guy to please! however this place and me got off on the wrong foot. First of all I think I was instantly turned off that this Hawaiian themed restaurant had about 0% of Aloha in their menu....I mean I wasn't expecting an authentic hawaiian meal but I was thinking there would be some sort of commercialized Panda Express/Bahama Breeze attempt at it? Or even a few Musubi's would have shut me up when it comes to questioning why this place went with a Hawaiian theme....but seriously the only Aloha in this place was the jungle print menu...that being said they could add a few more fish tanks and called this place the Rain Forest Cafe. However there is two reasons why I ended up here as many times (3 times to be exact) as I did and thats because I was staying in treasure Island and I had a coupon. \n\nI've been to plenty of restaurants where service is non existent and it doesn't bother me because usually there is some yummy food that more than makes up for it. I understand why some places may not have the best of service for reasons such as being understaffed, cultural differences (In some cultures if a waitress is constantly coming to your table it means they want you to leave rather than enjoy your food & chat with your party), or just simply not well trained. However when it comes to a Chain like restaurant in a Casino one would think that basics courtesy would be the standard? Not for 2 out of my 3 experience\n\nMy first experience our waitress seemed to be....off in her own world? the place wasn't busy at all but she seemed preoccupied with something ....just not sure what it was. The plastic cups for our beverages was kind of a turn off as well. My Chicken burger was super dry and all the kahuna bbq sauce in the world could not save it...and believe me I TRIED SO HARD! lol\n\nThe 2nd time I came here for a drink and the bartender literally took 10 minutes to get to me because he was dancing behind the counter? and the place was dead with only like 3 people sitting at the bar. When the bartender finally took my drink order he totally got it wrong because I wanted one of those cool long margarita glasses and instead got a 10 oz disposable cup......fail....\n\nMy last experience was breakfast out by the pool....this experience was a lot better! The food was good, our server was actually happy to see us, and made an effort to make us feel welcomed.\n\nall in all my last experience is the only reason this place got two stars instead of one....however if you don't have a coupon there are better places on the strip to spend your money."
0,"Before handing the waitress my card, we went over what my family had. I got my receipt and handed the waitress my card to pay. Then, Random food items got charged to my card. I did bring to their attention that they incorrectly charged my card.They gave acknowledgement this was done with intention. I guess they thought I wouldn't catch it. \nThe staff can not be trusted and for this, We will never be back."
1,"Didn't know what to expect, but pleasantly surprised by Nathan Burton. We paid $10.00 for the main floor and received great booth seats at center stage. It gave the kids an upclose view of Burton's magic act.\n\nNathan himself seems very appreciative of having a Vegas show. I can tell he is naturally reserved, but his personality works for his onstage presence. He's seems genuine. Loved his showgirls! More importantly, the kids loved the show!\n\nThe magic acts were surprisingly authentic. I didn't dig the predictions part of the show, as I thought those could have been pre-planned. But the magic acts were excellent!\n\nThis is a great show for families with young kids!"
1,Great food and friendly counter staff.  This is perfect for an early run into work and craving Mexican food.  I got the chorizo burrito and it was perfect.
1,"My son tried this restaurant once and wanted to take me (and a friend). We arrived, and the hostess recognized him and welcomed him like a long lost friend. The rest of the staff was just as terrific. The food was the best BBQ I have ever had in a restaurant. Our entrees were the spareribs, baby back ribs and the brisket sandwich. Huge portions! All of the ribs were very meaty, excellently spiced, and delicious. Our sides included the mac and cheese (excellent), the corn muffins (addictive), and the fries. I loved the kale and cashew salad!  We tried the pork bellies and grits as an appetizer. Amazing! Very creative dessert menu! The best was that our server Les took us back through the kitchen to see the smoker. Got to meet the owner- very fun and appreciated!  Our server has an extensive restaurant background and it showed. We will definitely be consistent customers."
1,"Fried chicken plate was very good. Almost seemed burned, but wasn't just a darker breading. Awesome Brisket too. Cranberry orange pudding is highly recommended.\nMeat and Three lived up to the expectations!"
1,"Me and the man went to Spur Cross Stables last weekend and had a blast. My favorite part was the OVERSIZED pig named Gilbert. I think he was bigger than my horse.. girth wise... ha ha\n\nAnyways, don't be a fool like us and drive your Lexus out there. The pavement ends and you are driving on a rock road for about two miles. We made it, but would have preferred a more.. economical vehicle.\n\nOur tour guide Travis was awesome, but he is moving back to Colorado at the end of the month so you will have to get another tour guide. \n\nWe really enjoyed the trail and everyone was really friendly.\n\nCost was reasonable.. I think it was $108 for the both of us... we did the 1.5 hour trail ride\n\nThe horses are a little... out there... now that I think about it. My boyfriend got stuck with a half horse half mule... and people we ran across laughed at him... but the horses were trained well and taken care of, so thats all that matters.\n\nDont forget to play with the giant pig. He rules."
1,"Hands down the best CrossFit gym out there! Great Coaches, fun atmosphere and a hell of a workout!"
0,"I recommend definitely skipping this one. We went today and the service was awful. We were told by the hostess to sit in the side room b/c \""you will be served quicker there\"". After we sat, it was over 10 minutes before a waitress came to say hi. Then 10 minutes before she came back to get our order. Then 5 minutes later she came back to confirm she had our order right. Then 15 minutes before we got our sandwiches. Nobody came by to check on how they were, and nobody came with a check. So we flagged down another employee there and gave her a coupon and asked her to bring the check minus the coupon amount. She said OK. Then she disappeared. 10 minutes later our waitress finally came back with the check - but without having deducted the coupon amount. So she exited and 10 minutes later came back with the right amount. Throughout this experience there were restaurant staff milling around and congregating. The place wasn't busy. Meanwhile at the table next to us, after they waited 30 minutes for their food, the food was brought cold, and the waitress departed (another long departure) without having provided them silverware or syrup (it goes well with pancakes). A customer from that table went searching for her after 5 minutes without the waitress bringing silverware. Never experienced service like this. Oh yah, and the food...mediocre for a college cafeteria."
0,"I like this place. Good atmosphere and good sushi. The reason for 1 star is that it is advertised as gluten free friendly. My sister has celiacs, so to double check we called to make sure. They said yes! We are! When we got there (after ordering a bottle of wine) we were informed that there was not options for her. When we talked to the manager, he got a really big attitude. Bad experience. It's just frustrating that they market as friendly, but have no options. Educate yourselves."
0,"After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Caffe Boa I am sad to say I didn't have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat. \n\nWe were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.\n\nWell, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)"
1,"Great burger joint inside the Cosmo! Nice decor and atmosphere. Our table was wobbly, so being a designer in for the Hospitality Expo, I was a little po'd at this since everything else in this hotel is exquisitely designed. But, won't knock off points for that.\n\nThe food: ordered the \""Nom nom\"" burger...Kobe beef burger with cheese. It didn't come with lettuce, tomatoes, etc., but they're available for the asking. Overall, very good...not as melt-in-your-mouth as the kobe burger at one of Wolfgang Puck's restuarants, but tasty none the less. Got it with steak fries...again, good, but about the same as what you could get at say Fuddruckers or KFC; nothing special, but still good.\n\nService: Good. We could tell our server was either tired or just tired of working in Vegas, but at least she still made an effort to smile. Another server who accidentally poured water into my 1/2 empty Sprite glass was better and more fun. We all laughed, she realized her \""super fail\"" (as she exclaimed), apologized and provided me with extra soda and popcorn...which had me thinking, \""why didn't our main server give us popcorn when we first sat down??\""  Again, neither here nor there.\n\nFor the guys(& maybe some of you ladies): the servers in the bar area...wow. Very hot asian ladies in tight red mini-dresses?! Take that, Hooters!\n\nOverall, a nice casual place to eat amongst the swankier places in the Cosmopolitan. Definitely better than some of the other burger offerings in Vegas. Guys, if your girl doesn't wanna leave \""The Chandelier\"" bar, just go up and have a burger & watch the game at Holsteins! You're welcome."
0,"Went to this place for Valentine's day.  Nice atmosphere, thought it was going to be a great night, then everything went to hell.  We were hungry for Italian food and got trapped there by their \""special\"" menu, meaning you paid $40 for a 4 course meal.\nThe appetizer was bruchetta.  You could pick from one with tomatoes on it, or one with cheese on it, that was it.  I choked down what was a small piece of bread with a few tomatoes on it.  Next, we got a salad, which was basically some lettuce thrown onto a plate with no dressing on it.  You got a choice of 4 appetizers, chicken, pork, shrimp ravoli, or steak.  They informed us they were out of the steak and chicken.  My wife got the ravioli, which was 5 ravioli stuffed with cheese.  They took a small piece of shrimp and cut it into 3 pieces and threw it on the plate.  Her's was ice cold. \nThey did prepare a chicken for me even though they were \""out of it.\""  It was essentially the same amount of chicken in 2 chicken wings.  It was cold and very, very dry.  \nThey threw some vegatables on it that weren't cooked and had been sitting out all day, so were dried out and hard.  They topped it of with a giant scalloped potato cake that was probably from costco.  Was cold as well. \nWe told the waiter that this food was unacceptable.  He did apologize and felt bad, so I don't blame him at all.  He said he would get us a piece of tiramasu, instead of the few desserts we were forced to get.  \nThe owner came over and said that we were one of the later tables, so that is the reason our food was bad.  He gave us 10% off our bill.\nI at about 10% of my food, just to do something.  We should have gotten 90% off since we essentially were sending back full plates.\nThis was the worst food I've ever had.  I would be embarrased if I owned this \""Italian\"" restaurant and allowed my chefs to put out this garbage.  None of the food was italian whatsoever.  No breadsticks, no pasta, nothing.\nThe other reviews are lies. Avoid this place."
0,"The Feast Buffet at GVR is always clean and inviting. Service is acceptable and at lunch you can get a fresh rubin or grilled ham & cheese at the teppan station. The selection is decent and they have spamoni for desert. If you like deals get a players club card and you can eat breakfast for $5.\n\nThat said, sometimes the line seems to take forever to move. If you do a teppanyaki they only use ground meat (not good.) I am yet to see a crab leg at the place. They also kick you out between meals. We met for a business lunch and just hung around the table reviewing paperwork (not even drinking soft drinks.) The place was mostly deserted and they came over and told us we had to leave in 5 min. Ok, not eating, not drinking, not preventing anyone else from having a table. We left. I guess they were worried we would pay for lunch and get dinner....gasp! wait, no crab legs, yeah we were not waiting for dinner service. \n\nFor the price it is just okay, we usually just go over to Sunset Station or the Rio."
0,"It's a small place, max capacity is 68. You get hot tea right when you sit down. I got the wonton soup, tasted very bland, comes with 12 wontons for $6.99. My husband got the garlic ribs. It's breaded and deep fried. Had absolutely no flavor for $12.99. It was hard to down the food even though we were starving. We were still hungry after, so we went to Lee's Sandwich. I have no idea how it got 4 stars."
1,"I asked my Mom to take me somewhere really healthy, while I was visiting her in Phoenix a few weeks ago. She decided to take me to Green. I knew I would like it upon first walking in, and indeed it was very good! They had a lot of fake meat products on the menu, but I decided to go with the Mongolian Tofu. It had great flavor, and it was very filling. I also drank the Sweet Lime, which was very refreshing, especially in 106 degree heat. Everyone we were with enjoyed their food, except my boyfriend, who wasn't too into their version of fake mozzarella cheese...was kind of rubbery, but um, what do you expect? Real cheese is where it's at, hence the reason I could never be a vegan. The inside of this place is also cute -- my kind of place! I wish there was something similar to this in SF, because I would go a lot!"
1,"Unlike my experience with another Vegas buffet, I thoroughly enjoyed Wicked Spoon. (and cheaper, too!)\n\nCame in for a weekday lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything was.  The presentation of all the little pots for the food was a nice touch.  I liked that you get your own little portion. \n\nService was good, and the lunch came with either a mimosa or a bloody mary, nice!  \n\nThe asian section was good, especially the fried rice with chinese sausage, yum.  Galbi was a little salty, but other than that, no complaints.  I also loved the carving station, where they had succulent bacon/pork belly, and the skirt steak, which was nice and juicy.  Even their sausage was really good.\n\nI'm not ashamed to admit I ate plates and plates of all the wonderous fatty food... I love some good buffet!  And the dessert station was great!  That is a huge compliment from me.  Their gelato choices were impressive, and they had molten chocolate cake that was delish!  Definitely would come back here for the prerequisite Vegas buffet experience.  Recommend!!"
0,Waited for 30 minutes to just pick up my frames. There were two people sitting at the desk doing nothing. Go else where if you care about customer service
0,"The restrooms looked like after an bombardment, an improvised shack amid buckets of olives and spices. Highly questionable hygiene for a food store!Disgusting. I will not go back until they clean up the place. It's just filthy!!!"
1,"Fried, greasy, comfort food at it's best.  Vegetarian friendly!  The service is great, because the servers will all help any table.  The atmosphere is fun - divey.  Even when there is a wait, I've never waited more than 10-15 minutes. \n\nThe VEGETARIAN CHILI is a bit sweet for my taste, so I'm not a huge fan of eating a bowl of it, but it's great on a hot dog, burger or fries.  \n\nSpeaking of hot dogs and burgers, they have vegetarian versions of both, so you don't have to miss out on any of the fun burger combos or corn dogs.  Vegetarian corn dogs!  The breading on the CORN DOG is sweet and corn bread-ish, but lighter and fried.   \n\nI had the VEGGIE DOG with CHILI and PIMENTO CHEESE.  Everything about it worked for me.  The dog itself probably isn't that great, but smothered in chili and cheese, it's delicious.  \n\nThe FRIED PICKLES have a basic flour breading (which I prefer over cornmeal, but not as good as tempura batter).  They were crispy and served with a thick creamy ranch dipping sauce.  \n\nMy sister enjoyed the SWEET POTATO FRIES.  I'm never a fan, so I'm not a good judge, but I found them to be sweet and limp, not at all what I want from a fry.  \n\nThe DING DONG STYLE BURGER is weird but everyone at my table enjoyed it (to varying degrees).  The peanut butter flavor was a bit too strong, so we countered with loads of sriracha.  But the honey slaw on top was a nice touch.  \n\nNOT QUITE FRIED TURKEY SANDWICH is not at all fried, for those who are wondering.  It's a baked turkey that has been sliced and layered on a bun with bacon, fresh basil, tomato, mayo and cheese.  Husband found it to be an acceptable healthier alternative to what the rest of us ordered (minus the cheese and mayo).  \n\nThe baked PIMENTO CHEESE WAFFLE FRIES with BACON = the piece de resistance for us.  They are careful to layer the pimento cheese inside the fries so it's not just on top.  The bacon is perfectly crispy, and while this might have been the most decadent dish, it's definitely the most delicious.  Add sriracha for more amazing-ness.  \n\nI did not get the bill, so I have no idea how much the BANANA PUDDING cost, but it was too much for 4 of us to split (so whatever the cost, probably worth it).  It's messy looking, slopped into a bowl with a couple of spoons stuck into the top, and it's nothing gourmet or interesting.  But it nicely satisfied all of our sweet cravings at the end of a gluttonous meal.  \n\nOnly come here if you don't care about fat or calories.  It's a cheat meal, for sure."
0,"This is a good location to take the kids to a tailgate movie. The location is rundown and poorly managed and maintained. \n\nThe customer service is actually great from all of the employees from the ticket counter, to the concessions. The problem is the old fat manager that stands in the driveway yelling at kids and customers. He is a rude jackass that needs to go to his office and keep his mouth shut. He publicly berates employees, and this is greatly unappreciated.\n\nHe needs to spend more time focused on maintenance and cleanliness. The quality of the food needs to be improved. It doesn't even meet the low standards of Regal or AMC."
0,"A couple of things to do:\n    - Drink Beer at the Bar\n    - Watch Sports\n    - Ride the mechanical Bull\n    -  AND Stay away from the food.\n\nThe food was not good. I got the Diablo Chicken Pasta. Although the warning messages on the menu about the dangers of eating meat was a pleasant reminder, it did not deter me from it. The Diablo Chicken Pasta tasted bland, mixed with penne pasta, some crushed peppers, and a MAC N Cheese taste. I love Mac N Cheese, but this was no bueno. Especially for 14.95!!! It wasn't spicy and overall it was  just a terrible dish.\n\nAside from that, the sandwiches also looked mundane. One item I would suggest is the Mushroom Lovers Pizza. That is if you love mushroom and flatbread pizza. \n\nThis is definitely the kind of place where the environment and style undermines the food. The service was good. In fact, it was toooo good. A person would come and check on us every three-five minutes. First the manager, than another waitress, then our waitress. Afterwords, she came again and asked \""how we were.\"" I don't mind the intrusion, it was just a little too much and annoying. \n\nOverall...B-\nGreat Environment and Unsatisfactory Food."
0,Way over priced.  Food was okay but definitely not one of the best buffets in town.  Highly recommending passing on this one.
0,"Good food, had to get it re-done because it was swimming in a pool of oil. Went there for lunch and apparently, there was only server and one assistant for the entire place..our food was very delayed. However, they do have a good menu and the food is certainly tasty."
0,"The only reason I will be going here is that it's the closest gym to my house.  After my free 1 hour personal training session that came with joining, it will take all my energy to walk back into that place.\n\nI've never seen such high pressure sales tactics.  The dude trying to sell me their outrageously expensive personal training packages just wouldn't take no for an anwer.  When I said I needed to ask my husband about the extra money, he said \""I'm disappointed that your husband doesn't support you and you have to ask him about that kind of thing.\""  What an a-hole.  I walked out at that point (before I ripped his face off)."
1,"I've been going to Someburros with my family since it first opened in Tempe on Baseline & Mill way back in 1986 or so. I live in Chandler now so we go to this one most of the time. It's good food. I like the tacos, the pollo fundido, the green chili, the rod burro, the refried beans, and the rice. It's not 5 star food but it's 4-star and that beats a lot of the others. We like casual dining so this place works for us."
1,"I have to give a big shout out to Big Two. I stopped last minute to put oil in my car @ a nearby QT (I know right?)\nOf the 15 people that walked by, only a Big Two guy stopped to see if I needed help. I didn't but that rarely happens anymore. Thank you!"
0,"Well this is the last time my co workers and I order from here. The food is mediocre at best and that's if your order even comes right. Beyond on that the customer service is THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD! The manager will call you a LIAR! They do not give you refunds and will argue with you about the situation. I was hung up on, argued with and told that I was not worth the managers time. How rude. Spare yourself any kind of issue and loss of money because the prices are OUTRAGEOUS! All curse words that could be said, well I've said them."
0,"Have to say it, postinos still has the best food of any of the owner's restaurants. Drinks=great Desert=good food=not so good, expensive, very little of it on the plate...and my mom's a chef, so you think I would like that. People watching at Chelsea's kitchen is better. Hope the bulldoze this place to make more parking."
1,"I had an excellent lunch! Emilie M. was on point and on top of her game! The food and drinks were on our table quickly, even though she was busy with tables outside and in. I watched the other servers and they were obviously trained well or carefully picked. I love to eat and actually get Service! I will recommend this place to everyone!  Great job Emilie!"
0,Sure I was dragged here kicking and screaming to this place...A cover charge for some music that wasnt my liking...what the heck?!\n\nI demand a refund! The parking is horrendous!!!\n\nIts highly likely that I will not return to this place
0,"Maybe I was spoiled from eating at Phils BBQ (and I mean Phils in their original location in Mission Hills where the wait was always over 1 1/2 hours...before they expanded to Sports Arena and one other location)\n\nOr maybe Lucilles was a winning restaurant compared to here/\n\nWhatever it was....please take down your sign! You are NOT the best BBQ in Las Vegas. Some buffets offered better bbq then this!\n\nI didnt think this was that great...or great at all. The food was poor...I think Chef Robert Irvine should come help them make real food and showcase that in Restaurant Impossible, cause this place didnt not taste good. Service was good, the hostesses and waitresses were on point...just not the food. What a waste of space on the strip."
1,The place is very compact. Started with their honey chicken  this dish was Great nice and crispy skin with no breading.  I ordered their shrimp chow mein. The dish came with a lot of noodles and crunchy broccoli which is perfect for me  . We finished with their sun devil chicken . The service was good
0,"Very disappointed with Lolita's Happy Hour. Some co-workers and I had been looking for a fun, central place to do Happy Hour and settled on checking out Lolita's, based on (you guessed it) their advertised Happy Hour from 4-8pm. \n\nWhat they don't tell you is that Happy Hour ONLY consists of $5 well drinks, $5 house margaritas and miniature appetizers.  (Seriously, the Happy Hour tacos (five to a plate) are TINY, about the size of a thumb.)   Also, Happy Hour is confined to the bar area; it doesn't even extend to the patio!\n\nI understand that the place wouldn't necessarily discount the tequila drink menu. But they also don't discount the \""specialty\"" drinks, i.e., the margaritas and martinis. Those drinks remain $10-12 each. Really???? REALLY?!?\n\nHouse margaritas are usually bad news, so I went off the regular drink menu.  I had one good margarita (something with pear and mint) and a TERRIBLE white sangria. It tasted like Alka-Seltzer. And there wasn't even any fruit in it. (Sad face.)  \n\nThe service was ok -- they were busy on a Friday night but it took more than once to remind the waiter when we had ordered something. My Alka-Seltzer --err, I mean, white sangria -- took 30 minutes to come out.\n\nIn this economy, Lolita's would do well to take notes from the Blue Martini and think about discounting their specialty drinks and beer during Happy Hour. Because for the $28 spent (two drinks and one Corona), I could've had four drinks and a beer at BM's Happy Hour. \n\nSadly (and I say sadly because I wanted to like this place), I don't think I'll be back here again."
1,"Not going to lie, I thought the place was closed when we walked up to it. It's not exceptionally well lit on the inside and the outside is adorable but misleading. Anyway, the inside is very chic. A heavy red tint on the walls and very modern, Asian-inspired seating. Not a massive selection of yogurt choices but they had \""white boy vanilla\"" so that makes up for anything else they may lack. Really impressive candy/fruit bar and by the cup counter they had tall, smoothie cups too. So that's cool that they serve more than just yogurt. Really cool place!"
0,"I am giving this restaurant 2 stars only because the BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP was delicious (although  the it was a very small amount of soup for $9), the Waiter was good and the interior decor is beautiful and comfortable and very clean.  If the rating was based on the food and value for the price I would give it one star.  \n\nTHE REASON I AM NOT GIVING THIS RESTAURANT MORE THAN TWO STARS IS BECAUSE.....\n\n1  .  When we walked in (our first time coming to this restaurant) there were three people standing at the podium.  One of them said hello but then they all just stood there and stared at us.  We expected to be greeted and asked \""how many in your party?\"" or \""will you be dining with us tonight?\"" anything except a cold stare.\nSo my husband said \""can we get a table?\"" to which the response was \""do you have a reservation?\"", my husband responded \""no, do we need one?\""  No response to his question just the response of  \""hmmmm let's see........ah yes we can seat you\""  then  the person turned to the person next to him and whispered  said \""they got the last one\""  just loud enough so we could hear him as we were walking away..  Okay here is the problem I have with this....there were several empty tables and all of them were still empty when we left....so why did they act like they were doing us a favor by seating us in a half empty restaurant when we god forbid, did not have a \""reservation\""  are they trying to pretend that this is an elite restaurant that is hard to get into?  Oh brother!  Good thing the servers were nice and the service was good.  The front door staff needs to review what their learned about the hospitality business.  They did not make us feel welcomed.  \n\n2.  Because the FOOD WAS NOT WORTH THE PRICE we paid.  As another reviewer put it....\""there was just something missing\"".....\n\nThe PEAR CIDER from the bar was flat....I asked the waiter about it and asked him to check with the bartender to see if it was a fresh draw from the tap or maybe it was a bad bottle or maybe it had been sitting opened and gone flat or???  He came back and said the bartender said that is just the way it tastes.  I have had pear cider at a lot of places and it has never been flat.   This tasted like it had been watered down or something.   Another reviewer mentioned their Blue Moon tasted flat.  I wonder if they have a problem with their taps??\n  \nFor dinner I had the 1/2 ROASTED CHICKEN (it was a BABY chicken....this was not mentioned on the menu) it looked like the size of a cornish game hen.  It was cooked well..very tender...but the flavor was blah even with all the seasoning on it (which tasted very similar to Lawry's Seasoning Salt), the broccoli was just plain old steamed broccoli and the mashed potatoes were just plain old mashed potatoes with some herbs thrown in.  It was a very small portion and I didn't even finish all of it because I was so bored with it and it was so flavorless.  HOW CAN YOU MESS UP CHICKEN AND MASHED POTATOES??   It was just Blah AND IT COST $17!\n\nMy husband ordered the DR PEPPER SHORT RIBS with green chili grits and asparagus.  It was good and the different flavors worked well together but it wasn't anything worth the the price they charged.  I think it was $24 and the portion was also very small.  \n\nI don't mind paying a lot for \""good\""  food, but we left RENEGADE CANTEEN feeling like we had been ripped off EVEN THOUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WAS GOOD AND THE SERVICE WAS GOOD, it just didn't make up for the lack of flavor in the food.  The FOOD is the most important thing!  \n\nUnless we hear that some changes are made to this restaurant we won't be back in the future.  There are too many other places nearby where we can get a good meal that is worth it's price."
1,"The store is well organized & pretty quiet when I was there. This place has a good selection of shoes, g-strings, etc. It was my first time in there so I spent a lot of time looking at everything (they have a ton of stuff) & the girl behind the counter was patient and helpful. Probably my new favorite store of this kind. :)"
0,"Ordered two simple burgers.\nAn original with only lettuce, mayonnaise and American cheese. And a veggie burger with only lettuce, mayonnaise, tomatoes and cheese.\nWe got an original with tomatoes and onions and a veggie with onions and no cheese. \nEnded up being the driest and most terrible burger I've had. Should have asked for my money back, go anywhere but here for a burger -__-"
0,"I've eaten a lot of bbq to separate the good and the worst and Big Erns is definitely in the bottom of the list. \nBefore i do the cons I'll tell you the pros on my visit. \nI just enjoyed the Brisket.. \nCons...\nFirst and foremost, let's review the ribs... they were not moist and very chewy. There was only 4 pcs and I gave up on the 3rd one. A BBQ joint should always have good ribs.\nSecond the pulled pork. That pork was so dry and chewy also; even L&L hawaiian bbq does a better job at it even at late hours!. The sauce is not evenly spread out. \nA BBQ joint should have a good sauce and yes the sauce was good considering they only had one flavor that's comparable to the ones I buy at albertsons. \nNext I had the pork and beans...i don't know why the people next to me was saying it's good when it clearly taste like the ones I use to buy at walmart. No special taste there. To be honest I use to buy it as dog food. \nAlso did the Potato salad....that was horrible even my kid pointed out it was bad. I also had him try the cup of water telling him it's refreshing. He's reaction?? x[ like that. lol and last the dinner roll. Smh.. \n\nFor the price I'd recommend going to Famous Daves. They have a variety of sauces and the quality is always consistent.  I don't know if I went to Big Erns late but 5 pm there was still lots of people so there shouldn't be an excuse to serve it like that. \nAlso people should not always believe on over hyped places. Don't believe it till you try it cause most often it mind f***s u and u start to believe it's good. Believe in your taste buds ;)"
0,"Terrible. \n\nMy spaghetti was overcooked and flavorless, the free wine was like vinegar (but what do u expect of free wine), the cappucino tasted like it came from a vending machine, the service was slow, and the old frail man on the accordian was kind of entertaining and cute until he asked for money."
1,"Unlike the other reviewers, I don't care about the lack of seating. They have the BEST pizza around! You will not regret it!"
0,"I had P.J. Clarke's bookmarked for a really long time, when I go to the Forum Shops, it's usually to eat at Joe's, but I had been hearing so much about the $1 oysters during happy hour, I finally decided to walk passed Joe's and give them a try. We sat at the bar, started out with an order of James River oysters and Luna (I can't remember which was offered during happy hour, they serve both East and West Coast) and the bartender kept stressing that only one is offered during happy hour. We kept telling him \""we get it, we are ok paying regular price for the oysters\"". When the oysters arrived, they looked decent, but the taste fell short of anything I'd crave. I wasn't impressed. I ordered a Moscow Mule, it was really bad. I don't know if it was the ginger beer or if he added something to it that isn't supposed to be in there, not sure how you can mess up this drink. Anyways, we left and went to Joe's to get real Kusshi oysters. I don't see how this place has stayed opened. Maybe they surivive on their crappy hour."
0,"I tried this place for the first time today and definitely will not be going back.  They are very pricey for what you get, and everything was way to greasy.  They also got my order wrong, but were quick to fix it."
1,"Love that place, pizza and wings are amazing"
0,"I was really excited to check this place out.  The menu looked pretty awesome when I checked it out online.  Reviews here, to sum up, seemed to be pretty mixed, with one's experience tied pretty closely to ordering the right things on the menu.  Armed with knowledge gleaned from other reviews, the lady and I rolled over there on a Friday night at 7:00pm.\n\nThe parking lot was a ghost town.  There were two tables being served.  Not a good sign, but hey, let's give it a shot.\n\nWe were immediately greeted by a friendly young guy who took us to a table of our choosing.  We were also immediately greeted by a NASTY smell in the air.  It smelled like someone dropped a deuce under a table.  Five days earlier.  This eau de outhouse permeated the entire restaurant.  I'm not the kind of guy who is up for making a big deal out of things.  I was fully prepared to try and ignore it and have some dinner.  The lady?  Not so much.\n\n\""Ummmm.... excuse me.  Do you smell that?\""\n\nOur host/server sheepishly replied, \""Haha... yeah, I guess I'm just kind of used to it.  It comes and goes around here.  It's the whole area.\""\n\nNow, I'm not a huge fan of the East Side in general, but come on.  The parking lot smelled fresh as a daisy by comparison.  There is clearly something horribly wrong with this building, and I hope that the young owners of Nosh and Swig have an attorney to help them get out of whatever ugly lease they are tied up in.  \n\nAfter he said he'd be back to take our drink orders, we held our breath, and made a beeline for the front door.\n\nI feel awful for them - and I hope they can get into another location.  One that doesn't smell like the parking garage of the Four Queens.  Two tables at prime time on a Friday night?  How many more Fridays can they possibly have in that space?"
0,"My husband, my friends and family and I have been there many times and the first word that comes to mind for us is inconsistent.  Sometimes the crust has been nicely done to a satisfying end and other times it has been like eating pizza on a large bagel, incredibly doughy.  The last time we went, we got a pie for some friends to come over to watch a PPV event.  Several people commented on how salty the pizza was.  It tasted quite different than it typically did in the past.  Just bizarre.  We also had an issue with them honoring a coupon that was assigned to their location and not expired...  When its good, its a fairly solid pie, for Phoenix.  But its a crap-shoot every time.  Think we've given them enough chances."
0,"OMG, loved this place before the fire, but now the service is haphazard, the food is for lack of words, interesting. Good news , it's clean....will try again but if worse, will tell you all why... I hope I am having very bad dream!!! Please, only 2stars!!!!"
1,"Bobby's is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. \n\nThe first night I got there, I went straight to the top of the stairs and had the special. The second night I went there, I had the very same thing. I cannot remember a more satisfying dinner. First impressions are everything.\n\nApparently, nobody knows Bobby's until you say Bobby Mancuso, who's something of a hotshot in the Valley of the Sun. And fortunately for you, most of the yuppies head to various other fancy restaurants in the Kierland area. For now, you can pretty much walk into Bobby's unannounced and have a first class meal. \n\nUpstairs is just the kind of bar I would put together if I had the money. All top shelf stuff, and and old guy behind the counter. Jazz pianist over in the corner (although this guy had electronics ), room enough to eat at the bar or at small tables, excellent music and the TVs silent. \n\nBobby's has a serious menu. You can get caviar and Stoli here.  You can get tortilla soup. You can get Clams Casino. Something about Clams Casino that's a touch more classy than Oysters Rockefeller. But you can get them too, or escargot. See what I'm saying? If you want to get to a man like me, you need to know that Ceasar Salad is made with an egg and you *always* put in the anchovies. They obliged me with extra fish. \n\nI had the special steak. I think there was a combo of the Roberto and the Gorgonzola, but I know that I had stuffed prawns with it as well. Oh mama! Like I said, it was incredibly satisfying. \n\nService at Bobby's is top notch. The staff is attentive, efficient and well-mannered. They're not too pushy or overly dramatic. See, I can already that I like Bobby. He's my kind of guy, and this is just the kind of signature restaurant to have.  You really should splurge here, all the extras are worth it. \n\nI really can't wait until he opens a joint on LA. Or wherever, because it's a long drive from here to there and I really want to see what he can do with Osso Buco."
0,"I called Wilhelm Automotive today to schedule an appointment for the reconditioning of my battery. I asked the usual questions. How long will it take? How much will it cost? etc. Keep in mind this is a standard service, like an oil change, but much more complicated. The price of this service varies by make, model, battery cells, etc. The price can also change if there are complications, i.e. dead battery cells that need to be replaced, but the base price for the service is known.\n\nWell the person who answered the phone refused to tell me how much the service costs. I gave him my make, model and he still insisted that the price was unknown. That the price can change. \n\nI asked him to at least tell me the base price so I know how much to budget. The person refused to answer the question. He continued with the answer that the price could vary. \n\nI insisted that I understood and if something unexpected came up I wouldn't hold him to the quoted price, I'm just trying to get an understanding of roughly how much I should budget to determine if I can afford it. No luck. After 15 minutes on the phone, I felt like I was dealing with Fort Knox.\n\nThis is the equivalent of going to a restaurant and the menu not having prices. Even more, it's like asking the waiter for the price of a steak and the waiter stating that he was unsure because the price varies from plate to plate.\n\nYou guys need to find a better way of answering this question. I'm not the first, nor will I be the last to ask it."
0,"The food was simply not tasty, pita bread undercooked, same with the falafel, and when trying to address it there was no one there to get it :( Too bad, great potential. I don't see why if you are already in the kitchen cooking you wouldn't invest a little in trying to make it good, nonetheless eatable. This was a bad (and not cheap) experience."
1,"Such a fun downtown spot. Doesn't feel like you're in Las Vegas at all! They have an excellent selection of wine/beer/cocktails and very reasonably priced. Crab rangoons are some of the best I've ever had, perfect cream cheese/crab ratio. Shrimp Pad Thai was a little too heavy on the cilantro for our liking, it really overpowered the dish. There weren't enough peanuts either. Also tried the Garlic Fried Rice with Tofu which was incredible. Spice level 2 was perfect for both of these dishes. Can't wait to go back and try more items!"
1,"i had been dying for an indian joint in uptown across the street from me where the prices and food was good. yea a pipe dream up until now. basmati rice, nice and flavorful and so far the entrees were great.\n\nchicken tikka- the base was very tastey and flavorful. the chicken was dry but thats ok im happy there is chicken tikka in my mouth\n\nkadahi chicken- not too heavy which is a first but still good. chicken was juicy and thick enough base where it stuck to the rice and chicken\n\naloo gobi- which is a potato, cauliflower spice dish was very tastey and flavorful. a bit spicey for me cuz im weak sauzze but i didnt care. \n\nwhat i noticed about this place is that their food was not heavy...usually when i have indian its like im prego and can skip a meal or two afterwards. prices are great 5.99 for 1 meat entree or 1 veggie entree for 4.99...i will be back to lick the pans they said i can if i wanted to."
1,Great atmosphere great ice cream and burgers friendly staff best DQ around looking forward to come back again
1,"Great food might be an understatement, even better prices! Love Komex Fusion, only reason I gave it a 4star, is it could use some major scrubbing inside but if you are willing to look the cleanliness the rest is great."
0,Worst service I've ever gotten. McDonald's has better manners than the girl serving us. It took a minute to get our food which she couldn't get right. And who fills my sprite with water? I'll never go back. This place went to garbage quick.
0,"The hostess in front was not at all friendly. She didn't even welcome us. Just asked for name and party. That was kind of a bad start... The wait was 50 minutes for Sunday at 12... We waited the 50 minutes Bc I had wanted to try this place for a while....we were seated in 53 mins. \n\nThe waitress Megan took 10 mins to greet us at our table ad she wasn't all that helpful. When I asked if the waffles were good and she replied, \""yeah.\""  Let me tell you after she too our order she did NOTHING for us. We actually ordered another side dish through another waiter.  \n\nThe busboy was great! Always filling up our water cups. We personally gave him cash tip and left our waitress with a 5% tip Bc again she did NOTHING. She didn't even serve our food get us condiments. NOTHING. \n\nMy husband got the ham steak which took 20 mins to rcv. I ordered the waffles and it took 30 mins. Again I ordered waffles- not chicken and waffles just waffles... 30 mins. \n\nThe male waiters were all very nice and attentive to us and our needs.. All of the women workers seemed to have a pretty large stick up their............ \n\nI will not return here again.. So disappointed in the upgraded ihop/Denny's food.  Not worth the wait, money or rude service. Blah!  \n\nThe service was so bad that my husband who never complains about anything, was even pissed and called the manager... He spoke with \""yushon?\"" And she offered to pay for our next meal which we all know is the restaurants way of saying \""shut your complaining\"""
0,"Definitely overrated, I had higher expectations after hearing about this place.  It was way too busy for the quality of food.  I think there has to be a better place when sober.  I think I would love it drunk, but not too much beef and fries had no taste to them.  Staff and customers were nice otherwise I'd only have given it one star.  I wonder if they suffer from quality decrease due to popularity because I definitely was expecting better.  Location is great with easy parking, I would try it out as an out of towner maybe, but I would look elsewhere for lunch or dinner and keep this in the pocket for late night dining after drinking."
0,"The food presentation is not that impressive. There is a lot James Dean, Elvis and Marilyn Monroe chotskies, which makes it look like a diner instead of a breakfast place. No designated hostess, 2 registers, yet no one seems to know what is going on. Front of house management.....well, what FOH management?"
0,"Horribly disappointed. Tempura veg entree, served with nothing else, and appetizer fried tofu--both came at once, ('GIving them both to you, hope that's okay' says unsmiling waiter. What was my choice, at that point?) after friend had  finished her appetizer. Tempura tossed on plate, with tiny scraps, as if scraped from the fryer. Both dishes were greasy and  flavorless.  Food served tepid--had just been sitting under the heat --ho--lamp. Waiter unsmiling. Spoke with manager later, explained I didn't want a free meal, but just to let him know...he merely said, 'Sorry.' and hung up.  Never, never  again."
1,"My last two breakfasts here I have ordered the 'Healthy Turkey' .... which is an egg white omelette with diced turkey, spinach, feta cheese, diced onions and tomatoes. It is served with an english muffin and is very tasty! ... My husband continues to order his standard raisin french toast smothered in butter and warm blueberry sauce .... with two eggs over easy on the side .... and is still loving it! : ) The coffee is also consistently good and is kept topped up by the great wait staff."
1,"Walked in here the other night and it might be my new hangout on the Central Corridor. I ordered the black truffle burger and the short rib poutine. Reminded me of the poutine in Vancouver, but way tastier. They had my favorite beer, Stiegl on tap. This place is within walking distance of my house. I love the ambiance."
1,"I'm hooked. The chicken is tender, the crinkle fries are amazing and the sauce is the best part. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area and looking for some food."
0,"Inside was very warm we had to wait quite a while for a table. They offered for us to sit outside but it was 110 degrees and they have no mister system. The service was VERY slow, I ended up having to get my own napkins and chop sticks as the waiter never brought them or asked if we needed them. My 10 year old son was never acknowledged and that drives my nuts, he is a person and deserves to be spoken to. \n\nThe food was good, but everything is fried so I hope you don't want a healthy meal. \n\nDo NOT go there with a groupon, the owner gave me a lecture about how he doesn't make any money off groupons and if I come back with another one he will not honor it. He won't have to worry because there are plenty of other places for me to go where I'm treated much better!"
0,"I usually don't shop at Bashas' and now I know why. I went to the Blockbuster store located in the same strip mall and realized I needed to get something for dinner that I didn't have. Not wanting to waste time driving to another store, I ran into here.\n\nUpon walking in, I noticed how old and dirty this place was compared to other markets.  My wife was appalled at the conditions. Her comment to me after we walked out with our grocery bag \""Let's never go here again\""!\n\nI've heard you save some money at Bashas', but I don't think that is the case. I found the prices to be about the same or in some cases more. The meat quality was poor (in my opinion).\n\nSome of the check out stands were ones I recall when I was a kid in the 80's. The old turnstiles. I was shocked they had a price scanner given how ancient they were. \n\nFor me, Basha's doesn't even come close to Fry's, Safeway, Sunflower or Trader Joe's. Bashas' is well below the other chain super markets."
1,"This place is awesome!!!!!\n\nDon't forget to get your locals card if you live in Vegas, so you can get 2 for 1 drink specials all of the time.\n\nThey have good food, great servers, and awesome drinks......"
1,"This is a pretty good place...except for the beer anyway. I have to admit that this is mostly due to my taste in beer. I like the hops. Our waitress was great! When we needed something, anything, she was there. She was knowledgeable regarding beer and food. The food was great: we enjoyed the garlic fries, the bratwurst small plate and the goat cheese flatbread. The only beers were brewed according of the German purity law of some century and were too bland for me. The seasonal Saison was worth a pint. There were others that tasted good but I need to be assaulted by hops. It won't happen here. But...it is a good lunch."
1,"So I've been going to The Parthenon for nearly 2 decades and it was always really great but the last couple times I've gone the meat tasted different...like not as good. I don't know if they've changed vendors or what but something is definitely not quite right. Previously I would have give the Parthenon 5 stars but now it's closer to 3.5/4 stars.\nI dont like potatoes but my husband loves the fries. \nI have also tried the baklava, souvlaki and chicken kabobs. The baklava was delicious, the souvlaki was good and the kabobs were just ok. \nThere is outdoor seating in front and on the upper terrace with is wonderful!"
1,"The best burger in Phoenix.  Reminds me of how Five Guys Burgers and Fries used to be.  The smashburger and smashchicken (fried) are delicious.  Ever since ordering the haystack straws, I've never been able to muster up the motivation try the fries.  You'll have to wait for your burger or chicken because they make it to order.  That's a good thing, by the way.  And, in case the name of the restaurant did not tip you off, yes, I will confirm it in all sincerity, smashburger is not the place to go if you are on a diet."
1,This place has amazing food.
0,The owner is a condescending unpleasant person who belittles his customers. The food has been on a steady decline for a number of years and is getting worse by the day.  stay far away from this money pit! unless you want to waste money on bad food and a horrible experience.
0,"Don't go here!\n\nMy wife and I bought gift certificates for our mothers to go here as a thank you gift for setting up our wedding shower. Unfortunately they were very busy after the wedding working to pay for everything so they couldn't make it to the spa before the gift certificates expired after six months. I realize this is a long time, but the spa still accepted our money, so they should return a service. \n\nThe moms finally tried to set up an appointment and called to see if they would still honor the gift certificates even though they had expired, knowing they would probably be spending additional money on things beyond what was covered by the $15.\n\nApparently the spa decided they were going to keep our money and not return a service and just said \""sorry, those are expired\"". \n\nSo, I can't even review their services because they chose the path of greed over friendly service."
1,"I went here several times awhile ago they deserve a good review ! Beautiful fine dining restaurant !  Great host server and atmosphere ! a group of 4 we had lettuce wrap,  BBQ pork, war won ton soup, double order of steamed large prawns with eggs The best ! Cooked perfectly ! Live steam sea bass another great dish, Peking duck with steam bun,  sashimi gaint clam, garlic prawn fried rice and pan fried ong choi garlic. Excellent food ! Highly recommended !"
0,"You can make better dinner for yourself at home.  For waaaaay cheaper at that. Its such a shame that this replaced the wonderful Market Bistro that used to be there.  \nAs if it wasn't disappointing enough-things have gotten WORSE.  If poor service, mediocre food, and high prices weren't enough to ruin a restaurant, they've gone and gotten the bright idea to have live...er...music...on Saturday night.  (I use the term \""music\"" loosely because if that is music, then everyone who can YELL lyrics to a song in an off-tune is a musician.)  So now to add insult to injury they have ruined any ambiance they may have had.  \nIf anyone is wondering why I am only just now posting my opinion of the joint it is this-I have the unfortunate circumstance of living across the street :-/   I NEED EARPLUGS!!!"
0,WHAT A BUNCH OF CLOWNS!!!! \n\nTried getting my car washed this morning but the manager was in the BATHROOM and there was a line of cars waiting for that fool to get done with his morning crap!\n\nNEVER AGAIN!!!!!
1,"When my well traveled cousin came to visit in Madison before departing for the Peace Corps (2 years in rural Guatemala) I scrambled to find a dining experience ethnic enough for her tastes.   I actually heard a lot about this place and since I didn't know what Peruvian was, I took that to mean it would more than suffice.  I used to dine at this location quite frequently as a freshman when it was a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, so I was amazed at how the interior was turned around.  We had dinner here and the candle light bounced warmly off the yummy mango colored walls.  We were led to a cozy corner of the restaurant and was greeted by an attentive server.  Not sure what to order, we asked his opinion and discovered his thorough knowledge of the menu.  I ended up ordering the lamb while my cousin opted for the seafood dish and a chicken cheese dish.  \n\nWe ate how we were raised--sharing en trees--and I found each plate to be delectable.  The lamb was so succulent, each bite so rich and hearty my mouth watered for more.  The seafood dish (which was recommended) was done to perfection--shrimp plump and juicy, King Crab legs already cut.  My favorite was the chicken dish which had an interesting cheese crumb outside layer.  The sides made out from corn were rich in flavor.  \n\nOverall this was quite an interesting dining experience.  I've been having pangs for the chicken and surprisingly the lamb ever since.  Though I'm not familiar with Peruvian cuisine, my taste buds tell me this is as true as it gets!"
1,"If you are considering to try their: \nchicken skin, lechong kawali, tosilog, bbq pork, bangusilog and bicol express, yes try them -- they're all *good.\n\nThe bangus was a bit smaller than i expected, the lechong kawali and chicken skin could be a little crispier.\n\nIf you like bicol express i think you're gonna love their bicol express! Out of all that i have tried their bicol express was impressive!\n\nAlmost all of the groups who were there at the same time we were there ordered bulalo so i'm assuming their bulalo is good. We're gonna try that next time we crave for Filipino food.\n\nHaving said all these if their prices were a little higher and their servings a little smaller i probably would think twice about giving them 4 stars."
0,Worst Delta I've flown with. The average worker is not helpful to say the least. Flying with a buddy pass has never been more regretful than this joyous occasion today. Checking into an airport at 6am with intentions of being on a flight at 745 and them turning you away because they claim there are no seats but allowed others to get on as standby is ridiculous than to be told you'll get on the next on at 1040 and when boarding comes around you're then again told you have to wait until 1pm is quite frustrating. To deal with these frustrations you tell the attendant this is complete bullshit and she tells you to watch your mouth as though she's your mother... Can you see why I will never fly with delta again?
1,"I was in Vegas this past weekend and decided to try this place out.  It was so worth the $35/hr!! I had Lisa and my girl had Ling, both had amazingly strong hands!!  I was so relaxed I fell asleep and was apparently snoring! hee hee hee : )  The next day I went again with 3 other girlfriends.  They were able to move a chair into the room so that we could all be together.  They all loved it!! \n\nDefinitely worth your money, don't waste hundreds at the hotel spas!\nAnd don't forget to mention \""yelp\"" so that you can get the $35/hr rate!"
1,"Sehr gutes Essen, tolle Mittagsangebote. Dazu eine riesige Getr\u00e4nkekarte. Alles in alles eine absolute Empfehlung f\u00fcr Studenten und junge Leute!"
1,"I'm VERY particular when it comes to work to be done on my pool--I'm known as the \""pool diva\"" in the neighborhood. I'm beyond thrilled with the work performed by Bullfrog! My tile looks fabulous (especially after the silicone sealant)---and the acid wash truly brightened up my 3M quartz plaster! Thank you for your promptness and attention to detail! I will call upon your services again when needed plus I highly recommend your company!!!"
0,Service is BAD and food quality is just OK... Disappointed! We ordered ramen and waited around 1 hour. Salmon fried rice and kata yakisoba were salty. Two items were served that we didn't order. I won't go back this place.
0,"The quality of food was what I had expected for a tapas restaurant in Las Vegas, but even for tapas, I was slightly surprised at the extremely small portions over the higher price. I mean we're talking 2 bites at most if you are sharing (which I was) with somebody else! The Pan con tomate was pretty much the only 4 bites I had in succession on one plate. Think mini food.\n\nThat being said the flavors were spot on and even exceptional when it came to carne asada, the roasted peppers were a great compliment to the slightly spicy beef! My biggest disappointment was with the 'lobster', aka langoustine, which I felt a little lead astray on by our server's description. When asked how large the tail was, she gestured a hand width of about 6 inches. To me, this justified the ~$16 price tag (I can't remember exactly how much it was but it was on the higher end). When it came out, the lavender scented foam was slight, not overpowering, but the meat in the tail was less than that of a large shrimp you find in a neighborhood grocery store. I felt so bad after one nibble, I gave the rest to my boyfriend to try and make up for the fact that I bombed on this suggestion. Other than that, the tempura shrimp were done well with a very nice dipping sauce, and the special (gourmet grilled cheese) was to die for. I mean--how can you go wrong with grilled cheese?\n\nOverall I felt our $120 bill was a little overpriced for the emptiness I still had lingering in my stomach. We did enjoy the experience, however I will skip Jaleo for a meal just as expensive somewhere else knowing that I will walk away without a guilty feeling. I'll leave that to the craps table."
0,Currently staying at the hotel and no WiFi in my room...tried the Ethernet cable and no luck. Called for help and front desk was clueless. Typed this on my own phone. Stay somewhere else.
1,"Very calming, enjoyable, holistic experience, more than just a massage. John does a great job making you feel comfortable and sharing thoughts about bigger picture ideas to feel good. Highly recommend."
0,"Waaaaaaaaay overrated. Here's the breakdown; half decent fries, very greasy burgers, sausages in a hot dog bun, and a handful of fatty mayo based dipping sauces. None of this is exceptional. And you WILL leave this poorly ventilated restaurant smelling like grease. that alone is enough to stay away."
1,"I have tried to find a decent burger place for months now.  I'm happy to say this place has succeeded in satisfying my cravings.  The burgers are great and as a bonus, the wings were amazing too.  I really loved the service and had the feeling that the employees really enjoyed being there.  My only complaint f I had to come up with one is that the \""hot\"" wings; weren't as spicy as I like.  They were perfect in flavor, but It would be nice to find a wing place with sauce as tasty as this but super hot.  I love a good heat challenge.  Good job on the burgers guys.  I loved every bite.  I'll be back soon for more.\n\n**Update, I tried the pig wings this time and would happily order them again.  They were simply great and just as perfect as the photos of them here suggest.  Your staff was as helpful as always in suggesting I try them and with drink suggestions.  I wish you guy were closer to where I live, but your worth the half hour drive."
0,"I'm a regular at Hawthorne and normally this location is good for service and food. But today was the pits. Called in pizza and ravioli for carry out. Pick up time quoted...30 mins. Arrived and this place was packed (Friday night). Paid and waited and waited and waited. After a total time of 50 mins. my pie was found...had lost ticket. Ravioli was missing, left without it but had pizza in hand. Two managers saw my disgust and told me to wait and they would follow up. No luck\nThe good news the pie was good\n Unfortunately  their \""system\"" needs some fine tuning"
1,"LOVE THIS PLACE AND SHARRON BRADY IS AWESOME!!!\n\nI called on Friday at 6 pm and did not expect to get an appointment on a Saturday but they got me in on Saturday at 10 am with Sharron.  I had a two hour window but she ended up spending 4 hours with me because I have so much hair and wanted a lot of highlights and my color corrected.  She was amazing and I love my hair.  Super sweet, patient and I would highly recommend her.  Will definitely go back and ask for her when it is time for a touch up!\n\nI expected a much higher price too so when she quoted what she did for four hours, color with highlights (five tubes of color), cut, dry and straighten I was floored!  I thought I had heard wrong.  \n\nThe shop is awesome and I always loved the deco in there.\n\nIf you have never been to Curl up and Dye it is not your average snooty hair shop.  It is down to earth, cool girls that talk freely, have tattoos and are as cool as hell!"
0,"I decided to go to the \""holiday skate\"" public session at noon. I'm a figure skater and wanted to have some fun on the ice, no tricks, just something to loosen my muscles and have a good time. I expected plenty of kids and families, but nothing I can't navigate around. \n\nI arrived early to catch the good ice, however it was already complete snow. Did a couple rounds, but became irritated and a little frightened at the absolute madness. \n\nNo staff was on the ice to keep at least some order to things. I figured during your busiest hour there's literally not one staff member to keep unsupervised children going in the right direction? Many loose items were on the rink,such as girls holding their purses while attempting to skate. Entire large families were holding hands on the rink, completely blocking the way...only to stop and take photos right in the middle of the ice. Groups of people were standing around oblivious to their surroundings, chatting and blocking the path.\n\nSkating here as a more advanced but considerate, SAFETY FIRST skater was impossible. Kids were falling all around me, and luckily I know how to navigate and stop before running them over (note that there was probably only 5 other skaters on the ice who knew how to skate so this is scary). Rentals were extremely dilapidated, and when I brought back a defective skate I was told in a condescending manner that I wasn't \""lacing them right.\"" Kind of scary for the next person to come along.\n\nI find their holiday/public skate to be *extremely dangerous*. Do not take your kids here, especially if they are weaker skaters or just learning. Save the medical bills and take them to AZ Ice in Peoria or Arcadia Ice, both much safer and fun environments for the little ones (and adults!)"
0,"Remember when this was Sunflower Market and it was awesome and rarely were things out of stock and carried just about everything I needed? Seems those days are over. \nIn the last 3 weeks Sprouts has been out of at least one thing on every trip I have made there. Last week in one trip from my shopping list they were out of Cinnamon sticks, bulk unbleached white flour, super dark roast bulk coffee, tofutti sour cream, and they no longer carry Sriracha. When I brought this to the attention of the store manager (who doesn't seem to be the sharpest crayola in the box) he seemed really apathetic. \nYep, seems Sprouts has ruined what use to be a good thing."
1,"This is an absolutely amazing place to have a romantic dinner or simply have a casual dinner. I have been here once, for my birthday a year ago and the experience was amazing. My date & I sate outside, the view of the strip and the Bellagio water show was the topping on the cake:-) The food was a lot but it was delicious especially their French Onion Soup; they really set the standards for me with the Soup no other place can compare after I tasted this one by far the best. \nOur waitress was amazingly sweet, helpful, funny, & tentative. I would definitely go back when I visit again."
1,Service was very good..calzone was excellent.
0,"C'mon people. Set the bar a little higher. NOTHING to see here, move along... If you think this is a great bagel, then you need to see a bit more of the world than your little square. Shame on Fodors for promoting this simple bakery."
1,Great food & service. Portion large. A little pricey: food and coffee was $10 .
0,"I am a las vegas local and i chose to spend my new years celebration and birthday (01/01) at the SLS. it went bad from the check in where they told me my room had been blocked out and they had to find another room. i booked a 632 sq ft lux king suite high floor. when i got to the room it was a smaller corner room. i called the front desk and they said it was their mistake but could not do anything about it since it was new years. i talked to a manager and all she was interested in was getting me off the phone she told me they had no other rooms available. i went back to the SLS website where i originally booked my room to see if they had availability and guess what they had an even larger room 955 sq ft for a cheaper price than what i had paid, but the manager insisted they had no other rooms available. Beware of this resort i have stayed at most of the other high end resorts in Las Vegas and this resort and staff are not on their levels of service. i wish i could take it all back because they ruined all of my new years and birthday plans. if this had happened at any other resort in town (Aria) i would have been comped and upgraded to a bigger room and there really was no availability they would put you up in a comparable resort with an upgraded room."
0,"Horrible, horrible ...I can't write everything I've heard about this place, because it'd be slanderous and probably hard to believe anyway. But beware of everything if you do get dragged here."
0,Broke a nail on the plane as usual and used yelp to find this shop. Walked in and it was empty. No one waiting and I told the last I needed a nail fixed (would have taken maybe  10 mins at most). Was them told they don't have anyone to helps. They are all booked for the night. It's 4pm. I find it hard to believe they were booked. Oh well on to the next
0,"Poppy Den is going downhill, fast. Don't waste your time..just go next door to Cantina Laredo or The View if you want a relaxing place to hang out."
1,"They have theee best baguettes there for 65 cents. I ordered #20, which was called \""Banh Mi Bo Kho\"" (Beef Stew with French Roll), and a Vietnamese ice coffee. The service was quick! The beef was soo flavorful, and the bread was perfectly fresh. It was fresh out of the oven; The light glaze of butter made the outside crispy and it was soft and fluffy on the inside. The Vietnamese coffee was yummy, nice and strong with a hint of chocolate.  Just describing it makes me crave it again. I'm definitely going back!"
0,"This place is a joke. And not only this location. They use to be decent but after weeks of asking for Serious Mass, which most places carry they continue to tell me they would order some. They use to carry it regularly. Even told me twice they would set some aside for me. Neither time did it happen and one time the rep told me they forgot to order it. \n\nThey have low variety, unless you want their brand of stuff.  They constantly try to push it on you. Never have the flavors you want and the staff seems to care less if you come back or not. Lets not talk about the time I asked for whey protein and the lady pointed me to the section with creatine. \n\nWant a better store that's considerably cheaper and offer a WIDE variety of products, go to Las Vegas Discount Nutrition. If they don't have a product they will order it for the next day. He'll even one of the guys ran to a nearby store to pick up what I need.\n\nGoodbye NR, you lost a regular customer."
1,An outstanding new addition to the Southern Highlands Bar scene. Staff is friendly and courteous and the food is great. \n\nThe place is also configured well and you don't feel crammed or worried about having a place to sit.\n\nPool tables are nice and parking was easy.\n\nWe found our new place to hang out.
0,"I visited this place because my boyfriends father saw an ad on TV for it. Immediately I  thought, Eggs R Us from TV? This sounds odd. It was semi difficult to find because it is located in a strip mall. The place was fairly busy but we helped a server put together two tables and sat down right away. Pretty good for a Saturday am. \n\nI couldn't help but watch the kitchen as I was facing them and they were all moving rather quickly. As I watched plates come out my first thought was, I wonder if those potatoes are bulk frozen potatoes? That's never a good thought when you are about to order. \n\nI decided to go for the breakfast burrito because that was what everyone here on Yelp recommended. I had no idea the thing would be as big as my head. Holy crap! I literally ate 1/4 of it. It was alright, nothing to write home about. Service was okay, dinner was crowded and small.\n\nThe thing that bothered me about this place was what I saw going on as I waited for my food. The toast was being made in the masses. I wanted to snap a picture of the toast mountain that was forming at the bottom of the toast roller, but it was right next to the busy servers. We kept talking how we didn't have an appetite for toast because of their bulk pile of white bread that had formed. Then I noticed something that made me want to immediately leave the restaurant. Gross! They were cooking food and putting it in buckets!?! OMG are you serving animals? That's what putting food in buckets reminds me of. I really hope that bucket food was something that burnt and wasn't being used. I never got to confirm. After reading Darren W's review, I think thats how they cook and serve food. Come on, guys! Disgusting. I will not go back.\n\nI think I'll stick to places like Cafe Davio, where I know the food is homemade, and not served in bucket bulk. Gross."
1,"We ate here around 2am after a late night out at the clubs - while in Vegas for a business conference  - and it was outstanding.  I had the Mongolian Beef and my two colleagues had other relatively common Chinese dishes, and all were excellent.  Still can't believe there was that high a quality of Chinese available in the middle of the night, right next to the sport book at the Venetian where I was staying, but hey ... it is Vegas.  Would definitely go again."
1,"We stayed at the Linq because of the location but only if we would have known that we would find the most knowledgable bartender on the strip, Matt. We ended up here on a Thursday night and have visited him and Lynsie (yes I asked how to spell her name cause she was that great) ever since. They even recommended a great comedy club which we had the best time at, so much better then hours in casino. This is now the 4th day in a row we have been back to see Matt and Lynsie, you can't go wrong with this bar/casino, 5am is also a good time here. Great bar, good prices and the best bartenders on the Strip!"
1,"Great pizza...but as another reviewer mentioned -- they are a bit feisty. Be forewarned that the slices are humungous, so one might do it if you have a small appetite, like moi."
1,"Black jeans, grey shirt, black tie and black Chucks. Sounds like something out of every hip GQ man's closet, my closet. As cool as I dress, sorry to disappoint, that is your waiter's wardrobe my friend. \n\nSuper sexy and super loud. Decor is modern and cool as heck with their M16 lamps. Yep, you heard me, M16s! I couldn't read the chalk, but rumor is someone wrote the Art of War up there. I guess the M16's make sense now!\n\nFood is A-okay, a lil' pricey though. My only gripe is about the bartender (see ART of Yelp), as I have not forgotten."
1,"nice place but expensive.  i lost a lot of money here so i might be bitter, but this place is just ok.  the atmosphere is unlike any place ive experienced.  its sorta weird, like someone decided to open a willy wonka chocolate factory.  nothing was really extraordinary when i went.  i guess i was expecting too much from steve wynn.  with advertising like \""it's the only casino that i would put my name on\"" i would have expected more.  but im still giving this place a 4 cause its nice and new. gj."
0,"First night- check into a stay well grand queen suite. Those nasty little escort cards were taped to the window, toilet was broken (never fixed), & we requested extra towels which we never received.\nSecond night, upgraded to the 2 bedroom Skyline Marquee Suite for that night and the next. No hot water in one of the restrooms. Call and talk to the front desk 4-5 times over the next couple of hours and they kept saying \""it was in the process of being fixed\"". Nobody ever showed up. So we paid over $1k for a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite and only got a 2 bed 1&1/2 bath. Also, my friend that was staying with me had someone spill red wine on his suit, he called and talked to them and they said they would come take his suit and get it cleaned for him. Good thing we didn't hold our breath because...  Surprise, they never showed up.\nThe lack of customer service was astounding."
1,"The boyfriend and I were looking for a good pho spot around the area that was delicious yet reasonable in price. We've been to Viet Bistro since it's closer to home but for their quality, the price didn't match at all. I checked out this place on Yelp and saw really good reviews so I thought this would be our second place to try. \n\nAs everyone knows it's been deathly chilly outside so we wanted some nice hot soup to warm us up! \nAs soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by a woman, and she told us where to sit. She offered us hot tea in which we gladly accepted and gave us our menus. \nThere were a few people in the restaurant, wasn't too packed.\nAfter a couple minutes a friendly man came and took our orders.\nI ordered the #1 pho combo which was like $7, the bf ordered #3 which was like $6, and also we ordered some spring rolls which were $3. \nOur orders came out quick and I noticed that the spring rolls were freshly made! It was delicious, and the peanut sauce was good as well. Not as thick as the usual sauce I've eaten before but good enough. \nThe pho bowls were huge  My boyfriend who ordered the #3 was quite surprised at how big his bowl was considering its price. \nThe soup was delicious and warmed me up, the meat was scrumptious and the noodles were perfect. Not one strand was soggy! \n\nThe man who took our orders was great, he was very friendly, always checking up on us and other customers asking how we were doing.\nThe restaurant itself was nice and clean, cozy and had a homey feeling."
0,Place was ok for pho fried rice very plain and over filled with onions and vegetable over all won't go again
0,"This hotel is good for what it is; one of the first hotel's on the strip.  This hotel is the first high rise in Vegas and remains and draws a rather trashy + senior citizen crowd.  \n\nThe location is good because it's by a 24 hour 7-11 and Dennys, but the pool is crap, the Restaurants in the Riviera are crap, the casino is gross, the rooms are umm.. a C?  \n\nWe paid around $60 a night for rooms here through a third party site and we were satisfied, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stay here or pay ANY more than 60-ish!  \n\nI can imagine this is the way my grandparents might have experienced Vegas :)"
0,"Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!\n\nTheir steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about, but a pretty good example of the standard Pittsburgh pizza place steak hoagie.\n\nThe seafood calzone is another story. Something in it was so bitter I couldn't quite eat it; I'm wondering if it was the garlic or perhaps a leftover burnt taste from the oven. Whatever it was, it was gross. The shrimp weren't that good either, suffering as they did from that certain \""I taste like iodine\"" flavor.\n\nThe advantage to R&B is that they're open reasonably late, given the location, but the phone service is rather surly and it always takes them an hour plus to deliver. Which would be OK if I didn't live a block away (normally I'd just walk and pick it up, but just for you, Yelpers, I subject myself to the vagaries of sitting on my rear end on the couch waiting for my food to arrive)."
0,"Their food sits there for a little while so the food can be a bit dry. I went to get more soda and their soda was flat. So the lady asked me, \""Why do you keep getting drinks?\"" \n\nWhy would you ask a customer that question?! I told her the drinks are flat and I was better off with water. She can be a bit rude- she has shorter hair. The lady with the ponytail is always nice =) It's an alright place but I think they should add more food on their menu."
0,"I have gone to the store once 2 years ago to get a bridesmaids dress and had a good experience.  So when it was finally my turn to try on bridal gowns I decided to go back here.  I have even researched on their website the dresses I wanted to try on.  Unfortunately during my trip they did not have any of them in stock because they are part of a trunk show, which I can understand.  SInce then I have made 3 different appointments with the shop during Demetrios trunk shows with no luck of the dresses being part of it.  At this point I am really disappointed in their service and their lack of wanting to help me.  I was told by the receptionist when I made my last appointment (2 weeks ago) that she would make sure that the dresses I wanted to try on were going to be part of the trunk show.  I had my appointment for today and have been gleaming just to be able to try on the dresses!  Unfortunately when I called this morning to confirm they where there the woman who answered the phone informed me that they were not.  So I've had to cancel my appointment yet again.  I just want to try on the dresses from the Ilissa collection #526 and #518, I didn't think it was going to be this hard to try on dresses I fell in love with over 6 months ago.  If I ever get to try on these dresses I will probably change my rating, I feel like I have been strung along and lied to ... I was willing to spend 5k on a dress and unless they can pull through on their next Demetrios trunk show I will have no other choice but to take my business else where.  Please step it up Demetrios and stop lying that you will make sure you will have certain dresses that you haven't been able to get in 6 months!!!"
0,"As previous reviewers have mentioned, it's rather ridiculous that Elephant House seems to milk all it can out of the fact that J.K Rowling wrote Harry Potter here. She probably wrote one page or something and it's pretty ridiculous the prices that this place charges just because they know Harry Potter fanatics will pay them just because they want to say they've been here. I agree with many of the other reviewers, unless you're really really into Harry Potter then give this place a miss, everything about it is standard... apart from the prices which are extortionate.\n\nElephant House overlooks Greyfriars graveyard and I went on a ghost walk there once only to be informed, yet again that Elephant House was the birth place of Harry Potter. Enough already!"
1,"Manager (Owner?) is very chill... Some people might not be used to it. It's a southern thing though! Lol... Anyways! The food is good, I always get either the pulled pork sandwich or the hot link sandwich. The BBQ is the ish!!!!!! I love it, can't get enough. I was reading some other reviews & all I can say is Love it or hate it, I happen to love it. PS: it's really not as bad as people make it seem... Give it a try."

0,"I use to eat at the Village Seafood Buffet when I lived here in Vegas. I am in town on business and thought I would go there for dinner on Friday night. I was shocked I got there about 615 PM and there was no line. But the line did show up right after I got in so this was the only plus. \nI was so set back on how poor the taste of the food was. The crab legs were dried out in side, like that the reheated the legs that went used the night before. The deep fried fish was cold and slimy inside. I took one bite of the lobster and almost lost my cookies, I was worried that I was going to get hit with food poison but it did not hit. \nThen to top it off I grab some stone crab claws, I grab one cracked it open and it was all moldy inside. I saw that I was totally scared to eat anything, stayed away sushi, the rolls. \nThe only think that was ok was the claim chowder\nI will not be back after paying 48.00 for old dried up food. I should have went to the Bellagio Buffet, had split king crab leg and peeled shrimp for 10.00 less. \nI will not be back\nService was a 4 star and I wish I could give 0 stars for the food."
1,Great food even better service!
0,First time staying at Harrahs and the rooms were decent. Only problem we had was the noise factor!! We were on the 15th floor and could hear the live band out front all night long in our room! It was very hard to sleep!! Casino and dealers were great!
0,"Went to Essen Haus for a birthday party meal last night, and as this was a last minute option, I had no expectations.\n\nWhich ending up being a good thing, because it didn't deliver much.\n\nI will say, I was very glad to see they had vegetarian options. I ordered the portabella cap, and while I like mine cooked a lil more, they sandwich had great flavor. However, the bottom of the pretzel bun was so soggy that I'm surprised the sandwich didn't completely crumble. My boyfriend ordered the Deutsch sampler which had pork 2 ways and a sausage with kraut and German potato salad, The total for his? 17 bucks. I found that to be completely outrageous as the plate did not have that much food on it.\n\nMy drinks were reasonably priced. I had a .5 Liter glass of Strongbow for 6 dollars which I found to be quite fair.\n\nYou wanna know what was just absolutely unforgivable though? The women's bathrooms. They were terrifying! They were disgusting and one of the doors to the stalls didn't lock!\n\nAnd as it was a Saturday night they had live music...which made it impossible to hear anyone not sitting next to you. Not exactly appetizing when you are trying to have a family meal..\n\nI would maybe stop by Essen for a drink on a weeknight, but I wouldn't stop here for a meal on a weekend again."
0,"Having now got 2 people on my case I thought it would be best to clarify and explain perhaps in more detail.\n\nFirst off, I didn't mean any offense to Cambodian people as a whole and if they are upset I apologize for my tongue in cheek attitude. I don't know any and from this experience I'm not bothered by that in the slightest.\n\nSecondly, the selling off as Cambodian is an inaccurate statement which I'll happily retract here. It would be unfair to both Vietnamese and other Cambodian restaurants. I was more trying to make the point to those that were wondering what Cambodian food was like, that it is very much akin to Vietnamese food. It's not my fault there are more Vietnamese restaurants in the US and probably based on this I can see why.\n\nGenerally I've found that places with a higher yelp rating are harder to get into which makes perfect sense to me. This place was NOT full (about half full when we came in) nor happening despite what the owner says! Funnily enough, he has the cheek to call me a liar?! Insensitive comments - yes. Liar - no. (More on the owner's lying later)\n\nThe poor start relates to that and the poor service which the owner disputes (I have no idea why this fact is disputed). If you have to wait over 5 mins. in a restaurant before contact (not physical contact as the owner oddly suggests) then that's a poor sign. I've only been to 500 places so what would I know?!\n\nThen the owner decides that because the food is brought out that makes it excellent service? Are you kidding me?! That was the funniest comment so far. That comment alone is enough to confirm to me that they have no clue to the meaning of the word service. Bringing out dishes is a given! lol Nothing to do with service - I will say the plates were put down on the table nicely if that's what is being alluded to?\n\nThe owner could just have asked where I'm coming from and I would have gladly responded with my opinion to which I am fully entitled as is the owner. Should probably think about \""customer is always right\"" before launching a senseless tirade/defense of service! Try engaging your customers and explaining things if it is sooooo different?!!!\n\nI'd add that the menu has a good number of items on it and never did I suggest that they should be able to make or sere every single type of Cambodian dish? That was funny too.\n\nBut by far the funniest is the comment about the egg roll coming at the end of the meal. Why would say that and then have a picture of the amok fish with an egg roll on yelp?! Yet the owner calls me a liar? Just own up - you forgot, had a bad day whatever. You think lying is going to make your place look better?!\n\nIf I were only judging this place against against other restaurants in the Phoenix area then I would have given it 2.5 stars. Not trying to be generous, I tell it how I see it. I'm glad other people had such an amazing experience but unfortunately we did not. The blame for that must primarily lie with the owner. I'd have thought you would want to satisfy your customers, not like to them!\n\nI give it a 1 star because I am comparing this restaurant to the many others I have visited and base if off the entire experience from start to finish. Why wouldn't I compare it? That's how a rating can be generated! You have to know good to know bad, so that to me is the essence of rating a place, by comparing it to others. It's nothing to do with how fancy a place is or not. e.g. a hole in the wall restaurant with good food and service would get 5 stars to me, but a pricey steakhouse with amazing ambiance but ok food and good service would get 4. Lying to the customer gets 1 star.\n\nTo finish (finally!) I apologize for the Cambodian references mentioned earlier, I meant no offense and hope to have cleared those up. However the service was appalling and the food lackluster. That was our experience. Nothing can change that now. Let's see if the owner can come clean or will they have to resort to more petty name calling like they are in the fourth grade!"
0,Not impressed at all!\nSunk in mattress and no refrigerator in a King Deluxe room.\nNice grounds
0,"I realize \""this is fast food\"" and not fine dining.. I get it...but I feel my complaints are legit. Over the years, El Pollo Loco has earned my respect as a well run fast food place. Great food at a great value. I've even utilized their catering services throughout the years with great success. There's a huge difference between having a crappy meal and having a crappy meal at a place you know is not a bad place.\n\nLast week, my mother and I stopped at this location to bring home some dinner. First of all, the young man at the cash register was a mumble mouth. My poor hearing aid-clad mother thought she had to get new devices... I assured her it wasn't her ears... the dude talked like he had a mouth of marbles. We had to ask him to repeat himself EVERY...SINGLE...TIME...HE...TALKED... Furthermore, he clearly did not understand the menu offerings... we had to explain ourselves repeatedly and finally found something and pointed it to him so he understood what we wanted to order. FRUSTRATING.\n\nThe food... the chicken we were given was way - way - WAY overcooked. We were watching the \""cook\"" put it in the box and we were incredulous that someone would deem it edible. It was BLACK. While we were waiting for our food, two other people came up to the counter with burnt chicken. It took forever for mumble mouth and his buddy to realize that they had a pile of people building up with burned chicken. When we showed him the food, he was unconvinced that the food was even bad. I wouldn't have fed it to my dog! He tried to strike some deal - 2 new pieces for 3 burnt ones. We flat out told him \""No, we think we should get all new chicken\"". He started throwing attitude our way. My mother, fresh off of a 3.5 hour flight almost went postal on this stupid kid. Meanwhile Senor Grillmaster was flapping his jaws behind the grill, burning more chicken. \n\nI've been to several El Pollo Locos around the valley and almost always get great food, great service and great prices. This location will not get our business again."
1,"Okay, so I admit it. Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of it's competitors. It took me a while to cave on this one. Too long in fact.\n\nEveryone loves Lux and as it happens, they have good reason to! My latte was supremely delicious. The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service. \n\nI absolutely love the patio area. This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me. The service was really laid back, yet authentically friendly. I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer. There's room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return. My primary concerns going in were the coffee, service and atmosphere. A+ for all in my humble estimation. \n\nI was a little late to the party, but I had a blast anyway."
1,"I simply love Palazzo.  The rooms are beautiful and it is always awesome to have a TV in the bathroom.  I also am a huge fan of the beds - it literally feels like you are sleeping on a cloud, and it makes the hangover a lot less painful.  I also liked our view of Venetian, which at night was beautiful.   My only problem was one of our towels had a stain on it, and although the towel was clean it was still a little icky to see.  However, it was definitely something which could easily be missed by the house cleaners, so it was no big deal.\n\nWe stayed at Venetian about a month ago as well, so it was interesting to compare the two.  Honestly, Palazzo is just a smidgen above Venetian - our room was a tad more modern and I think it is just a matter of taste in decor.  Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I am sure Palazzo (or Venetian) will be a go-to for us when we visit Vegas."
1,"Nourish was as pleasing to the eye as the menu was pleasing to the pallet. With a laid back personality, it fits right in in Scottsdale. It's located on the bottom floor of a delightful multi-level housing development. Once you get over the parking...it's located underneath Nourish in the same garage that homeowners use (hint: go left)...and find your way back to the main level all is right with the world. \n\nNourish appears to have been created for the health conscious since it consists of gluten-free and vegetarian fare. It boasts of \""comfort food with a healthy twist.\"" I ordered the Spicy Mango Avocado Salad with Ahi Tuna and was very happy to find that the tuna was cooked exactly like it should be. Service was pleasant. \n\nIf you are looking for a casual restaurant with fresh ingredients this is the place for you."
1,"this is a best kept secret on the strip! :) every time i stay at the venetian i try to have at least 1 meal here! like i mentioned many times in my reviews,  i'm a creature of habit, italian restaurants - i always order linguine & clams, mexican restaurants - chicken flautas with rice, and chinese restaurants - beef chow fun ALWAYS.... not this time! my bf and i were sooooo hungry that we ordered won ton noodle soup, chinese broccoli w/oyster sauce, singapore rice noodles, and chinese sausage fried rice. everything was delicious! the chinese sausage (lop cheong) fried rice was made a bit different then what i am use to, noodle asia makes their fried rice with egg whites only! very delicious! i highly reccomend this place for late night dining or a lunch time visit, but .... remember.... it's on the strip so the prices are a bit high! 4 items, 1 hot tea and 1 coke = $65 including tax and tip!"
1,"been here dozen's of times, finally decided to review them. The food is a step above the average Italian restaurant and the Sangria blow's away any other we've tried and we've tried quite a few. The mood is good and the manager, John, makes sure you are properly taken care of from service to food quality. Try the John Cole for a tasty dessert after stuffing yourself"
1,"Joe is worth the 20 min we drove from our hotel. Joe, the owner -- coolest 67 year old Bostonian we have ever met. The man oozes passion for his shop and the food reflects that. Our family of seven devoured our food, and I was on the verge of tears eating the first fried zucchini and mushrooms I've had in four years!  Gluten free foodies will relish eating FRESH fish and chips instead of the frozen stuff we're typically banished to!  A wonderful experience for the whole family. Highly recommend it."
0,"Vision Express is a chain opticians operating in pretty much every town center. You would imagine they are all the same but the customer service in this branch is beyond disappointing.\n\nI had my eyes tested in Vision Express in Perth and was given a prescription. Due to my poor student status, the nice lady gave me a form to fill out to receive a NHS discount. For that reason I couldn't pick my glasses that day, but the optician told me it would be fine for me to fill my prescription at any Vision Express branch.\n\nSo once I received my money off coupon I toddled on down to Vision Express in the St James Centre. Well according to the rather scary woman behind the counter there was no way in hell I could fill my prescription at any other store and it had to be the store I had my eyes tested in. We argued back and forth for a good 20 minutes before she turned me away. Poor show, you don't want my money? FINE. I will take it elsewhere. Thanks for the inconvenience. \n\nFunny how apparently I could only get my glasses at the one Vision Express branch where I had my eyes tested yet Tesco's opticians were happy enough to sell me some. \n\nNext time I won't use Vision Express."
0,This hotel has the worst customer service that I have ever seen. They were rude and the room wasn't clean. They had several homeless people hanging out in the lobby.
0,"I used to love this place, the food was great and the service was awesome.  However for the past year it seems like a revolving door of management and staff.  The food is decent now, but the service is so slow, even when they only have a few tables for lunch it still takes way over an hour to get in and out.  I have noticed lately the only time they are busy at lunch is when there is a convention in town.  It's a shame this used to be great."
0,I really really wanted to like this place.  A friend showed me flier she recieved and it had some new breakfast items.  I was so excited.  I was not impressed with the atmosphere.  We ordered at the counter.  The prices were very high for as casual as it was.  We waited a long time for our drinks. I have to say if you give me a cup of coffee I dont mind waiting for food.  Or at least offer some water.  It was pricey for a cup of coffee that never got refilled so it was starbucks like and not resturant style.  We got our food.  The french toast was great.  The egg sandwhich was just that a egg sandwhich for 8.50 and I had to buy 2 cookies and another cup of coffee cause I was still hungry.  The very worst thing was the crepes.  They were sooooo hard and the raspberry sauce ruined the fruit.  They gave me a free cookie when I told them about the crepe.  They also asked if they could make me something else but I was leaving after waiting for such a long time waiting for our food.  I don't mind waiting if the food is good.  Can I please get some apple sauce as a side or something.  I don't know.  I love small places like this with good healthy options but I want to eat and feel good after spending 40.00.  Pink spakler drink was good. For as many people they had working there was not alot of service and not alot of food.
1,We had a group and a back room was opened so we could all eat together in our own room!  The staff is really friendly and so helpful!  Love this place! Loved the burger! Can't wait to try more!!
0,I just don't get this place.  All the food comes straight from Cysco and falls into their fryer and onto your table.  The wings are lukewarm.  The service is bad.  The lighting is terrible.  The place looks dirty.  My wife had the fried fish and shrimp.  The shrimp were tiny and obviously from the frozen section of Costco.  So were the fish.  So were the curly fries (but those are damn good anyway)
1,I LOVED the baguette sandwich!  The bread was perfect. One hell of a deal for such a big sandwich. The tomato mozzarella salad was also great.
0,"I'm a big fan of ultra modern style hotels like Cosmopolitan and Aria in Vegas but The Blake just kind of fell short for me. I found this place when I was planning my businesss trip and noticed that the rates were pretty good and the pictures looked like it was a pretty solid hotel. I will say the lobby is pretty nice and is designed pretty well. The rest of the hotel follows the modern theme/look but there are just signs everywhere that this is a dated hotel and isn't upkept very well. Arriving at my floor off the elevator I walk out and immediately notice a base board that is basically ripped off the wall. I get to my room, open the door and wasn't blown away like I have been in other modern style hotels. It is decently done, but nothing amazing. First problem: the light bulb in the table lamp beside the bed was burnt out. This was really annoying during my stay. Second problem: the bathroom sink didn't drain well at all and I HATE that. Also looking around the room you just notice little signs of no attention such as the cool design clock on the wall that is like 6 hours off in time and the dirty grout between the floor tiling in the bathroom. I noticed a little hole in the wall in the room also, touched the hole and then something fell back into the wall and made a thud noise....what was that? I thought this would be a pretty cool hotel, but ended up being disappointed. WIth a remodel though and some attention, this hotel does have some potential though."
0,Not open when they say they're open.  Door clearly says 11 am.  Do not appreciate making a special trip to Mill Ave. for 11 am beer & lunch to discover they've decided to not open until 3pm for awhile because they're new.  Thanks for the inconvenience.
1,"We wanted to go see a movie to get out of the heat, and this theater was a nice walking distance from the hotel we were staying at...  The attendants and staff were very friendly. The movie theater is right next to the food court, so if you don't want to spend too much money on snacks in the theater, you can just go grab a bite to eat before going to your movie! Or go afterward! =) The theater we were in was nice and cool, and very spacious and clean!\n\nIf you're a Harkins fan & an avid moviegoer, don't forget to buy your Harkins souvenir T-shirt so you can get a free medium popcorn everytime you come in with it. Also if you purchase a souvenir cup, refills are only $1.50! These discounts go on all year long, just bring them in every time you come to a Harkins theater!"
0,"I've been wanting to visit an ice bar for ages, ever since watching a TV show which showed off some of the awesome Finnish ice bars. When I learned that there was one of these bars in Vegas, I knew I HAD to go and try it next time I was there!\n\nI'm happy that I have now been to an ice bar, but I have to say that the overall experience was so so much less than it should have been at the Minus 5 Ice Lounge in the Monte Carlo hotel, Las Vegas.\n\nOn walking up to the entrance of the Minus 5 ice lounge, we were ignored for a good few minutes by the girl behind the counter while she looked bored and made small talk with another employee (another review also mentioned this annoyance). Oh, and there were no other customers in sight. Eventually, she gave us the time of day and we asked for a $15 entrance for me (basic entrance with jacket + gloves provided) and a $45 entrance for my wife (which included a free drink, a fur coat, and boots). On entering we realized that my wife had not been given the boots that she had paid for. We mentioned that to the bar staff, but they more or less just shrugged and ignored us...despite us asking multiple times. Poor! If only that was the end of the issues....\n\nHere are some of the other issues that we experienced:\n\n1) Believe the reviews - the ice bar is much smaller than you imagine. There are some ice sculptures around and some different seating sections, but on the whole it's a very small place and doesn't live up to the advertising.\n\n2) The place was completely empty at 10pm!  Oh my...so awkward. I could not believe it when we walked into the bar and saw no other customers :( There is no way to see the bar before you go in, so we did not know it was deserted. When we asked the lady at the bar, she said that it gets busy later in the evening. Hmm...as far as I can tell from the reviews and photos, it's very common for there to only be one or two couples inside. Not exactly humming.\n\n3) The fact that the place is empty would be far less awkward if the bar staff were sociable and friendly. Oh...my...god! the blonde lady we had at the bar was so unfriendly. She didn't want to chat, she didn't want us to ask her any questions (every question we asked was met with a painful silence before each answer), and she didn't do ANYTHING to make our experience more enjoyable. Horrible, just horrible and totally undeserving of any tip (we left a small one, regardless).\n\nThe only good point I want to mention is the photographer. He comes in once you have your drinks in hand and takes a few pictures that you can purchase later. He offers direction and asks you to go to certain areas of the ice room + make certain poses that will look good on camera. It's worth mentioning that the ice bar doesn't allow you to take electronics inside (preventing you from taking your own photos and forcing you to pay for the ones that the photographer takes if you want a memoir). While I don't like this sales tactic, the photographer was a nice guy and about 10,000x more charismatic than the lady at the bar, so he was a welcome relief. Thanks!\n\nAll in all - very disappointing. Trust me, I really really wanted to like this place, but it's expensive, small, lacking life, and with mostly (except the photographer) terrible staff. If you really really want to visit an ice bar in Las Vegas, here is my advice:\n\n1) Go to the Mandalay Bay Minus 5 Ice Lounge, not the Monte Carlo one. I haven't been to the Mandalay Bay one...but ithe reviews are better and hopefully you will get better staff.\n\n2) If the lady at the bar is to be believed, go later (after midnight) rather than earlier.\n\n3) Go in a large group if you can, so that in the worst case scenario  there will be at least a few people in the bar!\n \n4) Just pay for the $15 general admission....don't bother with the other packages."
1,"I wondered how they get the meat inside the Pupusa... until I went to this place.  They have a window to look inside the kitchen and watch the lady make the pupusas.  I was staring in amazement as she made those little pockets of tortilla goodness.  There were a few moments where I gazed into her eyes and expressed my fondness of how she so lovingly hand crafted the pupusas.  That day I fell in love with the pupusa maker...\n\nbut I digress...\n\nThis place looks like a fast food place inside - not too much atmosphere.  Good service except for the fact that I do not speak spanish, but I do pretty good with pointing at the pictures on the menu and smiling. \n\nThe food... The pupusas are where it's at.  The rest of the food was just average Mexican food.  I have had pupusas at other places, but these were better.  They seemed to be bigger and had more filling.  \n\nI saw a guy eating what looked like chicharones... I am looking for those on the menu next time - they looked so good.\n\nThis place is way cheap too.  You can get a lot of food here for your money!"
1,"Tennis sale anyone?! Don's tennis has had a sale every time I've driven by. Located at the intersection of Morehead and McDowell, Don's tennis has everything a tennis fan/player would want. Tennis channel on the small TV all day. Demo racquets available. Every racquet you could want is for sale here, as well as shoes, balls, bags, hoppers, string, grips, etc, etc. Don is there most days and provides some fast talking, but is genuine in his advice and feedback. Usually a full time stinger working too, so getting your racquet re-strung same day usually isn't an issue.\n\nOne point to mention...only cash or check...no plastic."
0,"Disappointing visit.  Granted we went at 12 midnight, completely sober, mind you, that shouldnt mean customers of that hour should get jipped.  We ordered a steak quesadilla, 1 hard 1 soft taco, and a 7 layer burrito. All were jipped on fillings! The tacos had maybe a half inch of combined fillings, the 7 layer burrito has definitely shrunk in size and filling is just as poor. The only great thing about it was the nice drive through gal and the plentiful amount of sauces they gave us! love the verde!!"
1,"DELICIOUS!!! We waited about 40 minutes for table of 3, but no big deal as you can have a beer, or two, and the people watching is great!  We ordered the cornbread as an appetizer.  Pure heaven.  Buttery, sweet, smoky.  The brisket is so good, very tender and a great smoky taste.  The sauce is very flavorful, made me sweat!  If you like a sauce that is thick and sweet (like a sweet baby ray's, for example), this is not it.  Black Dog's is much better!  The sweet potato fries are nice and crispy, sweet/salty, and you get a nice portion of them.  The slaw is a vinegar slaw, not a creamy mayo slaw, so keep that in mind.  We got there around 6:00 pm and they were already out of the burnt ends, so not sure how early you have to get there to order them.  I'm not sure why some on here seem to be uptight about the service.  These people ARE WORKING THEIR BUTTS OFF!!  Have you seen how crazy busy they are?   Plain and simple, GO HERE.  EAT.  DRINK.  YOU WILL BE HAPPY."
1,"They serve apple pancakes here that are pretty special. It's an innovative baked creation. \n\n\nThen again, this place does things a little differently. Not like IHOP. \n\n\nI highly recommend the cherry crepes.... And I don't even like cherries. They just taste amazing!!"
0,"I can't believe people actually choose to come here.  I came out of necessity.  And I don't plan on going back.\n\nThe system that they have is ridiculous....one guy takes down your name and order and passes it on.  The next person prepares your order.  And another person rings you up.  Then you sit and wait as all the people behind you get their bagels first.  I think \""plain bagel toasted with cream cheese\"" threw them for a loop.  I mean why not get Dutch apple with walnut honey cream cheese?  If you want a pastry go to a bakery, not a bagel shop.\n\nAnyways, seeing as everyone was clamoring for them I thought that maybe I would be getting a good bagel.  It was truly awful.  It was so mushy and chewy...there was no nice crisp outside.  There was no yummy fluffy inside.  It was just round chewy bread."
0,"We went there looking for some good catfish & shrimp. I ordered the combo, baby back ribs & fried shrimp with a baked potato. The first thing I noticed was the baked potato was covered in grease. It had been fried, whole. I don't know if it was baked first or just cooked that way & called baked. If was gross! The next thing I realized, the baby back ribs were fried also & then some bar-b-q sauce added on top. I don't know anyone that cooks ribs that way. I will never go back. I feel nauseous just thinking about it."
0,"Let's start with the service from Antonio....not good. He was disinterested and when we asked him to recommend something he have us a blank state.\n\nFood wasn't good. Neither of ate all of it or even half and didn't want to take it with us. Both of us got chicken, enchiladas with mole for me and tacos for my husband. The chicken was soooooooo dry I couldn't even chew it. We got table side guacamole made with ONE avocado but was $8.50."
1,We always find deals when we come to this outlet center. Stopped at the Dickie store and found great shorts for $9.99 a pair.
1,"The staff and trainers are AWESOME!  My Wife and I joined just recently and together and it's been great! The classes and workout  without question, kicks your hide! I'm hoping they add an earlier class in the fall at 4:30am or 5:00am for the early risers. So worth every minute and penny. You get out of it, what you put into it."
1,"Built in 1916 the Omni William Penn is a beautiful hotel   with many intricate architectural features from a bygone era.  A wide variety of options for breakfast are made available between buffet offering and made to order.  The rooms are spacious and modeslty appointed with rather bland furniture.  Room service for the most part is prompt. \n\nThe hotel is beautiful and food is superb, but other aspects of the hotel are less then excellent."
0,"While I do love beaver tails (to the extent that I'd be okay with getting diabetes from them), this is not what I remember it was.\n\nI ordered a 5 \""Avalanche\"". Basically a cheese and nuts beaver tail. While it was good, it seemed rather expensive for 6$+Taxes. The beaver tail itself seems much thinner than what it used to be a few years ago. I also remember more toppings were added before although the length is the same, surely so it LOOKS good from the top but feels like a disappointment in the mouth. Also it was served to me almost cold... that was not really appreciated. The only reason I didn't make a scene to get a hot one is because my friend was with me at the time.\n\nPrices are disappointing for what is being served to us. Selection is OKay. Time to prepare is a bit below average for just a piece of fried dough with a topping squeezed out of a bottle. Mine was served almost cold on top of it.\n\nHonestly when I think about it, I finished the beaver tail because I'm a fatty food lover, not because it was actually good (if that makes any sense to you guys).\n\nNot recommending the place. Quality went down a lot after it became almost a chain in Montreal. You'd be better off stuffing your face with Churros from Costco to be honest.\n\nAlso they don't take debit/credit? Really? What the fuck."
1,"We tried this place due to yelp.   We were impressed with the atmosphere as it has beautiful art hangings and the place is clean.  I ordered the guacho burrito and the horchata due to the yelpster's recommendations. I usually don't go for beef so I wasn't crazy about the burrito, but it was good.   I was freaking crazy about the Horchata though!  I am a salsa snob so it takes a lot to impress me.   Rule number one - it must cause burn or don't call it salsa.   The seven chiles was so good that there wasn't much left at the salsa bar.   What was left, I took!  Second best salsa was the salsa peanut!  It was creamy, hot, flavorful and the best salsa peanut I have ever had!  So happy that they serve real salsas. My only recommendation for them would be to improve on the chips.   The chips are a bit thin, but cover them with salsa and all will be alright. When in Phoenix-go to this place.   It's a bit small, but hang in there and grab a seat and set your tongue on fire then cool it down with the horchata!"
0,"Been here twice.  First time I sat at a table and service was good. Sushi Rolls were good. It was a Saturday night and it was kinda dead...which is odd for the great location and the great set up of the place. Went for a second time and again it was dead on a Friday night...this should have been a sign. Second time I took a date who is a cook and has written a few books.  Not a time for Jimmy's to drop the ball. We chose the bar seating this time.  Service was god awful slow and the drinks sat dry for quite a while...my date's broccoli and meat was out at least 15 minutes before my rolls. She took one bite and gave it back. It tasted like something out of Panda Express. It was taken off the bill, but we received no apology from management. I give it a star for location and ambiance and a star for good rolls."
1,"Stopped in kitty cat products to, I have frequented the store the past six months\nIts alway very consistently clean, friendly workers and comparable prices to other stores."
0,"I wish I could give it no stars! \n\nThis place was horrible!!!\n\nMe and my BF sat at our table for AWHILE before a waitress (who was VERY grumpy!) acknowledged us and got us some sodas (which tasted flat). besides us, there was only one other table of four...\n\nWhen they finally took our order, we got the antipasto, a small pizza, and the clam linguine.\n\nIt took forever for the antipasto to come out and our food came rate after it (I thought the point of an appetizer was to have it before your meal not with it....). my bf's pizza had a weird aftertaste and was really greasy. My linguine had no flavor, and overcooked clams that were rubbery PLUS I asked for the white sauce and got the red...\n\nTo add to all of this, we were seated by where they make the food and had to listen to a couple of employees gossip about some shit and the hostess just had a mean look on her face the whole time. Does nobody want to work here? or did we just come at a bad time? well we wont be back, that's for sure! Such a sad disappointment cause my bf has been wanting to eat here for awhile.\n\nSo for horrible service, an hour of our time, 2 sodas, antipasto, a small pizza and clam linguine we paid $60!! NOT WORTH IT!\n\nYes. We were there for an hour if not longer...\n\nI can go to a wolf gang puck restaurant in crystals for the same price!\n\nWe went 9/21 between 2:30p-4:00p\n\nSo if you're going to go, avoid that time!"
0,"I'm not really a buffet person, so just let me preface my review with that.\n\nI didn't really find much here I liked. The seafood seemed to be pretty popular but I'm not a seafood person. The mexican section was pretty sparse when I went up there but when my wife went she seemed to find more than i did. Just my luck :)\n\nI think I ate a few slices of microwave pizza and some breadsticks. The mashed potatos were pretty runny but they tasted all right. \n\nAmbience-wise, the place was pretty loud and filled with drunk people. Dinner was pretty pricey at $30/person"
1,"I never would have thought this place to have such good food but it does.  I tried the Cuban here and it was stupendous!  I loved it, fresh, hot and yummy in my tummy.  Outside of this particular sandwich, they also do a chicken or pork bowl that's basically corn, black beans and shredded chicken or pork mixed with rice.  Very healthy choices are abound on the menu and there is no lack of choices in general.  \n\nThe best thing about this place is that if the weather is cooperating you can take your food out to the expansive patio and watch all the rafting, zip lining and rock climbing activities going on right around the place."
0,"OK you can gamble here but the retail/dining is a total, TOTAL suck fest and even though they have tons of land in Vegas the airport feels cramped and small: more like oakland then los angeles. It is spared the one star because of the very convenient location."
0,"I read reviews on the food at Diablo's here on yelp.  I should have listened to them.  The rice, beans and salsa were some of the worst I've ever had.  You have to pay for chips and salsa.  The guacamole was decent but was $12 and they don't give you very much. I had the rock shrimp tacos which were on the bland side.  Considering the price of this restaurant, you can find much better alternatives.  Try Pink Taco or Diegos instead."
1,"A pleasant Oasis of quality, affordable Mexican cuisine smack-dab in the middle of fast-food hell, I found The Blue Adobe to be a refreshing break from the seemingly endless array of franchise-clones that plague every corner of the greater Mesa area.\r\n\r\nMy first visit to Blue Adobe was immediately following a 14 hour drive from San Francisco with my ladyfriend Tassie and two drugged-out cats that somehow managed to howl most of  the way down.  We were tipped off to the place by another colleague of mine that had moved to Sun Valley about three years prior.  I was a little worried when I saw the establishments Howard-Johnson's style exterior, but all fears evaporated when we entered what I consider to be a first class effort at creating a great dining environment, and doing so without exuding the slightest bit of pretentiousness. \r\n\r\nThe menu was pretty interesting too....it was creative without resorting to obnoxious San Francisco-style creativity where the menu description gives little clue as to what you'll be served. To the contrary...the menu did a great job of describing traditional Mexican fare, skillfully presenting additional nuances that came across as tempting details rather than vague liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe food was great...tasty, and with several marks of distinctions that set it apart from anything else I've had in the Mesa area.  Skillful presentation, creative seasonings, and the absence of excessive fat were among it's strong points.\r\n\r\nWe went here twice, and both times we sung it's praises.  But Tassie returned here with her relatives one day, and not all went well.  The staff was friendly as usual till one party showed up with a infant/toddler.  It took eons to get a high-chair, and from that point on the level of service went from warm-and-fuzzy to cold-and-distant.  I still give it thumbs up for grownups....but reports from afar tell me that this place is anything but kid-friendly."
0,"We don't have Cracker Barrell in CA so we always stop in for some country cookin' while visiting AZ.  Today we learned they changed the menu and removed some of our favorite items.  They added a few menu items that do not compliment their \""country comfort food\"" theme.  I guess their executives don't know who their customers are or why people choose their restaurants."
1,"I'm part of the Phoenix-area comedy scene and we were given the opportunity to practice our bits every Sunday night.  We did one show in the Upstairs room and most of the comedians bombed on stage because everyone's ADD kicked in when they saw all of the things hanging on the walls and ceiling.  Sometimes that happens with people in new rooms who are less experienced in comedy (like me), but it was insane watching even the most experienced comedians do poorly at that show.  With that being said, it didn't work out the way we wanted to and we're not allowed back in, but I have no hard feelings and I hope they give us another shot.\n\nAnyway, 5-stars because this place is amazing.  Beautiful patio outside of the building, and then you walk in and the further you trek, the weirder and wilder it gets!  You think to yourself \""hey, can it get weirder than this?\""  Oh yes it can!  And it does from the very moment you take your first step upstairs....I can't even explain the upstairs room.  You need to check it out if you want your mind to be blown to pieces.  \n\nI wish I could talk about the food, but I got here at 10pm when the kitchen closes, so make sure you get earlier if you want food on a Sunday.\n\nIt's too bad we can't do comedy here anymore because it's such a fun room!  We're sorry we weren't funny enough for Minder Binders."
1,"This place is right outside my subdivision and is in walking distance from my home.  \n\nGreat food, the best values are at lunch, but dinner won't blow the budget either. My first dish there was Pad Thai and I wasn't disappointed.  Later on I discovered their Thai Curry dishes (the one with red curry in coconut cream sauce with bamboo shoots- I can never remember the name)\n\nThe folks there are very nice and helpful and the see a lot of me on \""pick it up\"" days.\n\nThe inside has a nice feel to it.  I just wish they made sweet tea..."
0,"It is what it is.  A big ol' Cheesecake Factory type place.   (shrug)   Actually I think the menu may even be near double the size of your average CF.   That's quite a feat.\n\nWe ended up here out of convenience one hungover (shocking) afternoon.  Service was slow but the typically large menu is helpful for any particular cravings you might have.    There really is something for everyone.  \n\nWe had to try the chili because it was made with short ribs and freakin' kobe ground beef.  Hard to pass up.  It was good but ridiculasly salty.   Also tried the patty melt on parmesan bread.   TOO greasy... even for a hangover... but if you like that sort of thing, get after it.  \n\nIf you're looking for a really great meal this is not the place for you, but it is convenient and good for families or large groups.   Just don't come here expecting greatness or anything."
1,"If I ever have a child, I want to name him Jean Philippe, but he will probably get beat up at school having a name like that.  The desserts here are absolutely decadent.  Not only do they taste good, but they are miniature works of art in themselves.  Pastry on the highest level is never overly sweet, and these are no exception.  The quality of ingredients is highly apparent the moment you take a bite into them.  Unfortunately our caloric allowances only gave room for my wife and I to order one apiece.\n\nThe strawberry shortcake was wonderful.  A very nice fruity strawberry flavor uncut by any of the red corn syrupy stuff you see in other places.  I had the vanilla eclair which was filled with vanilla pastry cream.  I think that they use Tahitian vanilla because it had a nice floral vanilla essence to it.  It was a full-bodied vanilla taste often not found in other places.  I did feel a little chalkiness to the texture which is from the starch they use to thicken it.  But, unless you make pastry cream on an ongoing basis, you may not notice it.\n\nDesserts here are not cheap.  At $7 a pop, they can cause sticker shock.  But are they sooo worth it.  Jean Philippe clearly demonstrates why he has received the award as Pastry Chef of the Year multiple times.  I don't think there are any bad pastries as I had some other ones when they were located in the Bellagio hotel.  The pumpkin cheesecake is also a seasonal favorite.\n\nDo not pass up the opportunity to get a bite here."

0,"The last four times I came in there were zero hand baskets.  Well gosh darn it they moved them.  How about a sign telling me where they are when I walk in.  Perhaps, the sign above the hand baskets telling me they moved would be better suited in the spot where the baskets were previously.   But, what the bajeezus do I know?!  Today, I went to the new hand basket spot and they were all gone.  Not a single darn tooting basket.  I guess I will buy a basket and balance it on my head like an Indian woman.  Maybe if I bring in the receipt for mt new basket Safeway will reimburse me!  Maybe they will also give me an additional .25 off my purchase everytime I use my basket.  Like those granola bags the hippies use.  Walking home with my purchase tonite my plastic bag broke.  If I had my basket this poopy thing would never happen."
1,Best margaritas in town!\n\nFood is affordable & very delicious! Best chicken tacos I've ever had!
1,"good comforting food that makes you happy when you're having a shitty day!\n\nso this was my last stop for taste mtl/mtl \u00e0 table and i was looking for it based on the braised shoulder pictures i've seen floating around.\n\ngot there, sat at the bar like usual and off we go. took a look at their wine/drink list.. lots of expensive wines, something i'll never be able to afford. anyway, settle for a jasmin virgin which is a tea lemonade. the citrusy taste was perfect for me and prep my taste buds ready.\n\nfor appetizer, i got the seared scallop with celeriac pur\u00e9e/soup with cauliflower and espelette pepper oil. you could definitely smelled the lovely scallop sweet scent. scallop seared perfectly, the celeriac pur\u00e9e was creamy while the cauliflower added that textural element. didn't taste the espelette pepper though. it was a good app. once i took a sip of my tea, that's when the scallop sweetness really made my taste buds sing. i like that!\n\nthen came the main, braised shoulder with potato cheese curds pur\u00e9e and bourguignon garnish and sauce. simply comfort food at its best! not only did it smell really good, it was simply sublime. fork tender pulled apart pork shoulder, the creamy cheesy pur\u00e9e and the tender green beans and the bourguignon garnish and sauce really elevate the dish. paired with the suggested red wine, it just reminded me of how it was like when mom would pick me up and sing a lullaby to put me to sleep. it wasn't \""wow, amazing\"" but more along the line of \""this makes me feel really good inside\""\n\nand for the finale, a creamy panna cotta with apple pur\u00e9e and cinnamon crumble. creamy luscious panna cotta and good apple pur\u00e9e. couldn't detect the cinnamon on the other hand. the crumble did gave a needed texture crunch to it.\n\ndespite the shitty cold windy evening, i had a lovely meal that made me feel good and that's what matter.\n\na big thumb up to the awesome music despite not really being dinner appropriate. a mix of 60s-70s music that just makes you want to sing out loud and dance..\n\nbill came to about $60 with tips.\n\nps. i will not mention the lady next to me that wiped out her ipad to watch a movie in the middle of dinner. a fast food joint, i don't mind. neither at a coffee shop but at some fine dining? right..."
1,More places should have an Ice covered bar top!  I love this place and I am getting a little old for Rum Jungle.\n\nI am starting to look like that statue as well.
1,A great place in the m resort to grab a quick bite for breakfast or lunch ask for a comp cause its always better when its free!
0,"I don't understand how this rates so high.\n As other reviewers have said, this is not good sushi. It's edible (thus the 2 star rating), but it's not great. I have been to this restaurant 3 times to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and each time I've been only mildly satisfied. They do not serve real crab, their rolls fall apart, and the service is not that great. Maybe I'm going at the wrong time? I have been there during lunch time each time I've gone and have not been impressed at all. On the 3rd try, my friend and I decided that we would not be returning any more."
0,Well... we came here after traveling the past four days & staying at other hotels... I called several places nearby before I even get started BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!!! \n*Called & they said 64 $ a night... cheaper then 100 $ we had been paying for Holiday Inn & Comfort inn so screw it why not... considering lady said there was a hot tub & a pool. \n\n*sooo then we get into this room... and we eat and all that mind u there's a creeeper ass weird old man that says one word to you as ur walking by... well anyways... hes extremely strange and makes u feel uncomfortable... come to find out that's the OWNER! Front desk lady said he's seenile. Wow... anyways... \nHe says no discount no refunds!!! Supposadly book keeper will. \n* No wifi!! As promised. \n\n* NO HOT TUB !!! \n\nJUST OVERALL OUT DATED NASTY SMELLY ASS PLACE... AND GHETTO ASS POOL. \n \nFollowing my daughter swimming she's now broke out... guess that their clorene or whatever is off... pssh wow...
0,"If you're already a regular here, congratulations you're getting great service. If they don't recognize you, good luck. It's not just my party, it's throughout the bar. A pedestrian beer selection and an unimpressive menu with horrible service. You've been warned."
0,Delivery Driver was really nice Pizza was pretty oily. Tasted good but later my stomach went sour.
0,"Things I know about Five Guys:\n\n1. They displaced In & Out on Zagats;\n2. According to my husband, one order of fries can feed three people;\n3. According to a good friend (who shall remain anonymous) \""Yeah, it's good, but I can eat at In & Out for half the price.\""\n\nI agree with all three. \n\nI went to the food court for lunch after a fine time at Nordstrom with the express desire to have a chicken caesar at Ranch One Chicken, but they were gone (I don't get to this mall very often). So, after looking around I decided to try Five Guys to see what all the hype was about. When I left, I felt robbed.\n\nYeah, the food was fine. Not brilliant by burger standards, but fine. I threw away about half the fries because, generous though the serving was, I was by myself and didn't need to feed three people. They also had an incredibly cool soda machine with loads of flavors but it was on the seltzery side. And throughout the afternoon I couldn't shake my frustration over the amount of money I'd spent.\n\nIf I want to spend that kind of money, I'll go to Fez."
0,"If you didn't know where it was you'd miss it.  Dining area is sparse, basic tables and booths. Open deli-style.  \n\nGot the chicken parm sub as recommended by Yelpers.  Mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich.  Still not sure i would order it again.  Fries are standard crinkle-cut.  \n\nSummary: good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but I wouldn't go out of my way to come again."
1,"Wow, some of the best coastal Mexican food I've ever had, hands down! \n\nSo who needs to go on vacation to get this type of food. Not this person.\n\nFree chips with seafood Ceviche as your wait person greats you. Good horchata and blended drinks. Oh yeah they have a wide assortment of Mexican beers and sodas. But the food is amazing. A very large menu. Many of the dishes share a similar yet very different spice combination that makes them all worth trying. I have been to there Madison location more than a dozen times and haven't had the same thing twice. All were great, some seasoned better than others, but all great. \n\nI look forward to going to this establishment and even crave it at times."
0,"I went to Tusca on a great recommendation, and was sorely disappointed. The sangria was great, and a definite highlight. \n\nThe service was okay, I guess. Our server was trying to be funny, nice, and was trying waaay too hard. He didn't seem to get that we weren't \""that kind\"" of table. \n\nI totally could have overlooked all of that, but the food was awful! We ordered the olives, which came covered in powdered Parmesan cheese. The Gorgonzola mashed potatoes had zilch for flavor. And this isn't a a cheap restaurant. I'm all about fusion, and will happily pay for quality, but Tusca totally failed!\n\nI agree with the Julie D. who said they seem to put the same garlic EVOO on everything. Honestly? It seemed a little like Olive Garden, or Cheesecake Fac. Overpriced, poor service, and fake foodies (the staff, not the customers - side note, the table next to us sent at least two dishes back). \n\nI would definately go back for sangria and outdoor seating (it was cold when I went), but would eat before I go!"
1,"WOW!! This food is SO GOOD!!! Thank you for the AMAZING fried rice & egg rolls. Loved it all!! The egg rolls have the perfect flaky crust. Highly recommend. We had this sticky rice before that is FABULOUS as well. Reasonably priced, too."
1,"I love this place, I think the biggest reason I love it so much is because my old lady loves Olive Garden so much but I hate eating there, it's so \""chainy\"".  Red Devil has great food, I've eaten their salad, wings, pasta, chicken, and pizza.  It's not the fanciest place in the world but they don't try to sell themselves as a fancy restaurant.  Just a really good, family, italian restaurant.  I've always had a good experience with the wait staff, especially Dewey.  Waiters don't have to be fake or say something special to me, I just want them to be nice, and they are nice here.  Prices are good, and their \""pre-dinner\"" roles are amazing, much better than olive gardes geasey ass breadsticks."
1,"I want to absolutely love South Point, since it's adjacent to the Grandview so I frequent it a lot during my week stay.  I've also stayed in their rooms for additional nights outside of my timeshare.  So I stayed there again this past Saturday night, the second time since shortly after they first opened.  \n\n1.  It's clean.\n\n2.  The room is large, 2 queen beds, plenty of space.\n\n3.  It's relatively cheap - I paid $86ish (Saturday night) on an online offer.\n\n4.  The non-smoking room I had on the 8th floor reminded my of Jean Nate.  I'm not even sure they make that anymore, but I remember buying my mother some of it for Mother's Day about 30 years ago.  It even came in a yellow package, and the entire casino and hotel is in a yellow color.  So my wife didn't like the perfumy smell.  I didn't mind it, but it was thick - almost as if they were trying to hide something (cigarette smoke?)  \n\n5.  It's a bit of a pain in the ass to go from the parking garage to your hotel rooms as you have no choice but to walk through the ground floor of the casino.\n\n6.  The bowling alley here is awesome.  A little pricey at about $3 a game and $3.50 for shoes.  But it is professional level (not that I would know, but it seems it would be).\n\n7.  My wife went to see a movie.  Go on a Tuesday ($5).  Every other night is $11.  So a really nice cinema complex.\n\n8.  I used to play blackjack here, but the $5 tables were full of younger, drunker types, and my younger, drunker days are more than a decade ago.\n\n9.  I watched football in the Silverado Lounge to kill some time before my flight.  Nice arrangement of TVs, no pressure to buy either since you have to go to the bar for service.  $4 beers.\n\n10.  I ate at the Garden Buffet several years ago.  It was meh then.  Yelp reviews say it is still meh, and I wasn't in a mood to prove yelpers wrong.\n\n11.  Resort fee is $14.  This sucks, but all the resorts have them now, and on the strip they are around $25.  Did I mention this sucks?\n\n12.  I'm still a fan, and will utilize their facilities on my next vacation, but I did end up spending equal time at the M Resort on this visit.  (Good buffet, an older, laid back Blackjack crowd)."
1,"PePeRo is the best place to get authentic Korean food in Charlotte.  I always go there for my Korean grocery needs but I find myself going there more often for a quick meal.  It is tucked in the back of the market and is not fancy by any means, but the staff is friendly and helpful.  If you have never had Korean food before, ask for a recommendation (bulgogi and chop jae good for beginners) and you won't be disappointed.  It will be fresh and delicious!"
0,"I went in Tuesday for a quick drink with a friend and was thoroughly disappointed.  I ordered a Long Island ice tea which is a pretty standard drink but the two young ladies working had to look it up online. Okay, fine, but they were missing a few key ingredients  but served it anyway and it was awful, instead of serving a subpar drink, offer something else. Service was slow too. When we were ready to pay and leave, the waitress was off sitting and talking with some friends."
0,"I keep waffling between 2 and 3 stars--2.5 is appropriate. Banfield is to pets what Nextcare is to people. They're available when you can't get into your regular healthcare doc and will allow quick turnaround on service at a decent price. \n\nThe issue I'm having is their immediate upsell on tests and \""extra's\"" and also when it comes to vaccinations and medication. In today's economy, I can't believe that Banfield would put such a hard sell for unnecessary items like they did with me on the last two visits. People don't have a lot on extra money to throw around--that's why they're coming to Banfield in the first place, right? \n\nOur last visit my dog Fezzy had an eye infection and his vaccinations were due so I asked for a price quote. The first step was to upsell me on tests (allergy tests, skin tests, etc) and then also to upsell me on the vaccinations and give him more than just Rabies and Bordatella. There was a shot for parvo (seriously? thought that was just once when they were puppies) and one other disease I didn't remember. \n\nAfter the vet examined Fezzy the tech came back and listed 5 medications for him, everything from an anitbiotic, an analgesic, an eye wash, an eye ointment and an allergy pill. Total bill was to be $465. I scrapped the vaccinations (can get them done at the Phx Spay/Neuter Clinic for much cheaper--$40) and all the extra tests--and when I was looking over the needed meds I noticed that the eye ointment was listed at $84.99! For a tube of triple antibiotic eye ointment. Essentially we're looking at spending $85 on a tube of neosporin. I was shocked! The tech said that the vet could give me a presricption for that one to take to my pharmacy if I felt it was too expensive. I immediately agreed.  I took the rest of the meds and with the appointment the total came to $105. \n\nHere's the kicker--I called 1800PetMeds--the price for the ointment: $35.99 plus shipping--oh it gets better! I called CVS on 7th Street--$24.99 but they'd have to order it. It gets even better than this---So I dropped it off at CVS on 16th and Camelback and went to pick it up in the afternoon--price was $15.99! A whole $70 cheaper than Banfield! Can you believe that markup??? \n\nStaff was friendly--everything else was alright--just watch their pricing and look over the details of your bill. Ask the question--are these necessary and does my pet really have to have that? Oh---your regular pharmacy can fill almost all pet medications. Check with them first--you'll keep some of that hard earned money in your pocket!"
1,"I've been meaning to write a review of how much I love Dr. Peterson and his staff, but like most people, I tend to procrastinate.  My husband however just walked into my office to tell me he'd missed a call, and it was a voice mail from Dr. Peterson personally calling to wish him a happy birthday - now that is customer service!!!\n\nWe were referred to him for an implant my husband needed done, and found everyone to be very friendly and professional.  We have returned to see him as our primary dentist and love everything about the experience (well, okay, as much as anyone can possibly love going to the dentist!).  Routine cleanings are painless, and every bit of what is being done is explained in detail so there are no surprises or uncomfortable moments.\n\nThe office and exam/treatment rooms are welcoming, the staff is super friendly and very competent, and we plan to be returning patients for many years!"
0,"I have endured endless requests to prebooze (Crescent Ballroom is a short stumble away) and/or dine here by friends. From this day forward, I will refuse to. If possible, I will navigate their thirst or hunger in direction of any other surrounding restaurants. \n\nVig is the new kid in town. It's (blandly) remodeled but wants you to think it's hip and those heavy-prices across the menu are therefor worth it! \n\nThey are not. The food is mediocre and certainly not worth the cost. Signature drinks are weak. And that service has a standstill at below average across multiple visits. \n\nPull it together, Vig!"
1,"I am giving 4 starts, because of the girls at the reception. They where really useless, and did not have a clue what they where doing. \nLuckily Matt, the manager, came out to help us out,  and calm us all down (it was 4 of us, plus another unhappy couple)\nBecause of the whole mess at the reception and everyone being really upset, Matt arranged, for all of us, to drive 5 cars(instead of 3 or 4), which was great.\nThe moment we where in the car`s everything went perfectly well. \nThe only bad thing while driving is- do not expect to drive fast.You will drive in line, one after the other one, and most of the time we had to follow  speed signs.\nBut we did manage to go few times fast for a few seconds, which was amazing!\nThere is no overtaking or doing anything crazy, and they are really strict about it, so if you want to drive fast cars really fast- this is not  drive for you!\nGreat experience thanks to Matt and other two instructors that where with us while driving!!"
0,"Unfortunately, the customer service at this location is awful and awfully slow.  Friday before Christmas, when you are the only one in line, you can hear all 3 employees talking about how they will not get any tips next week and probably forget all of their regular customers' names.  You should expect to be greeted with an attitude.  If the girl was quick with her service, I would try to overlook her attitude; however, she continued her conversation with the other employees.  Finally, when she was ready to address the customer, she said \""I need X dollars.\""  Nothing else.  One off instance, I hope so."
1,"Went here last night with my boyfriend & friends, we all are now obsessed! This place is great! The stand in line to order and receive a table number to sit at after ordering seems weird, but it's so Efficient! We went at 7pm (it was packed), we waited in line for about 20mins, however it went FAST. The staff is constantly bringing over samples for you to try, they take your drink order while in line so you can sip while you wait- lots of local drafts available and they even make their own triple sec and lemoncello! \n\nThe food is made fresh- and it's amazing! Every person in our group ordered a different burger and different style fries- ALL were GREAT! I ordered the shroom burger that has goat cheese and pesto on it and WOW! Best burger I've had ever. Parmesan truffle fries were mind blowing good!\nEvery person working was positive, nice and really wants you to enjoy your dinning experience there!\nAlso, a huge plus in my book is that they recycle and compost! \nWe will be back for sure. Well worth the drive from the West Side of the Valley!"
0,"Let me start by saying that I have not eaten here. My review is purely based on my inability to reach anyone to place a delivery order. \n\nBased on the wonderful reviews and a friends recommendation, I was so excited to try King Wong and loved the idea that they deliver! I tried for TWO hours to reach someone to place an order. After many attempts, unanswered calls, and busy signals....I gave up and moved on.  It is unlikely that I would try again. Disappointing."
1,"One of my favorite MGM properties.\n\nI haven't stayed at NYNY since 5 years ago, so I can't really say anything about the rooms, but I love this hotel for the feel and for the main public area and the restaurants!\n\nFirst off, my favorite steakhouse anywhere is Gallahger's.  It's is the same Gallahger's as the one in NY and when dining inside, it does feel like a NY steakhouse.  It's not the fanciest, yes, but it is just good steak.  There's a display fridge showing you how they dry age their beef and shows you that's exactly what they serve!\n\nThere's also plenty of other eateries that's legit.  It's overpriced, especially for pizza, but having a pretty authentic NY pizza at 2am in the morning is awesome.  Also others that's a little more \""fast-food-ish\"" but they all have something to do with NY.\n\nLots of bars, such as the Irish pub/piano bar.  It gets packed on the weekend and the crowd is a little older, but the pub does offer a good Guiness on draft.  Probably due to the crowd and moving through kegs faster, it just tastes fresher, or maybe it is the psychological effect :P\n\nOne thing is that the casino floor is a little dark and a little random for me in terms of the placement but it's still \""new\"" enough compared to some of the other hotels on the strip!\n\nAs a themed hotel, it does a pretty good job in presentation, albeit corny, but c'mon, can't expect real NY in Vegas!"
1,"The Mansions on Fifth is a beautiful venue to have your wedding!!  This is a family operated business and from day one I was showered with personal attention. The owners are very much involved in the day to day and were extremely accommodating, attentive and motivated to ensure every detail of my wedding was perfect.  Jennifer Pendleton (the event sales coordinator) and her team are truly the best! Jennifer definitely made the wedding planning process stress free and smooth sailing! I am so blessed to have hired her as a wedding planner and pulling off our special day. Everything was beautiful and flowed seamlessly. My guests NEVER wanted for anything during their stay.  We received so many compliments on our wedding and it was all because Jennifer and her team pulled everything together perfectly.  She knows what she is doing! If I had to rate my experience at the Mansions on Fifth from 1 to 10...it would be a 20! Whenever we needed something or had a question, Jennifer and her team were always responsive and quick! She was always professional, creative, and got the job done!  She understood our vision and it turned out beautifully! Thank you so much again and I highly recommend the Mansions on Fifth Hotel to any engaged couple!"
1,"I love the food here. I come here often. The dishes are large and there is always some leftover to take home. I always order the Mexican stir fry which is chicken and lots of mixed veggies. My girlfriend always gets different dishes and I eat off her plate. The staff is friendly, the beer is always cold and the music is lively. We always end with fried ice cream. I love love love my fried ice cream."
1,"Visiting from Cali, had dinner with some friends who lives in Maricopa.  From the moment you walk in, your nose is tickled with the fantastic smell from the open kitchen!  The four of us shared 2 appetizers; mediterranean antipasto platter and the cilantro jalapeno hummus...we almost fought to lick the plates.  Then my husband and I shared the falafel pita and gyro pita, deconstructed style...the falafel was phenomenal!  Nothing negative to say about this place.  The decor was unique, kinda street-art esque.  Wish we had one of these in Cali!"
0,"Stars are for the concept of the bar and crowd it draws. Cannot believe rudeness of some but not all staff. To begin, bouncer was unfriendly and statuesque.  Clearly we were an unwelcome addition and maybe because hes not working off tips. Small male bartender had attitude and I watched him ignore a couple who was patiently waiting to order. Another patron saw this and suggested we needed to be aggressive to get his attention. Really? Standing directly in front of him without a drink is not enough?? Maybe he didnt see us because of the contacts he was wearing for his costume..The three of us moved over to the larger male bartender who was very friendly and attentive..Next rude experience was waitress who I stood next to at the bar who handed me a few jello shots in exchange for cash. Next time I was up at the bar I asked for a few more and when she told me the amount I owed she added that the amount did not include tip..being a former server I am typically generous with tipping but all she did was hand me a few small plastic cups which was no effort on her part..despite the 2 staffers that do not get the concept that good customer service is their job and can equate to a better income it was a fun time and will go back."
1,"This was a refreshing delicious lunch. The only reason I'm giving them 4 and not 5 stars is I ordered their fresh lemonade, and they didn't tell me it was guava lemonade. I love guava but this lemonade tasted alcoholic:(. Their fattoush salad was amazing, it was the perfect combination of seasonings and lemon. I would definitely eat here again minus the Lemonade."
0,"Don't shop for a pet there! Seriously, are all the comments fake? Dogs kept in fish tanks with a tiny little water bottles. Who is vetting them and where they come from? I give zero stars here!"
1,"TIP: Sit outside! You get to sit next to the strip and see the Belagio hotel right across the street. I can imagine how beautiful it must be for dinner service.\n\nHubby and I had been pondering about a breakfast buffet in Vegas but opted out since we didn't want to spend $25-$35 at Paris buffet this time around. Well I got the sweet dish: fresh-made crispy waffles served with bacon in the mix with chocolate sauce on the side. Is your mouth watering yet? The waffle was satisfying but it wasn't the best waffle I've had. (Bouchon chicken and waffles are still my favorite.) The hubby opted for the savory dish which consisted of his favorite item: corned beef hash. Luckily for me, I taught my hubby to eat poached eggs and that was also included on top of the hash. Delicious...just add some hot sauce and your set.\n\nCoffee is refillable and served unlimited. Service was great. Thanks Mon Ami Gabi for an overall great experience."
0,"I would give this place 0 stars if I could.  I was here for 2 hours, and not one person said hi to me or acknowledged that I was even there.  I was going to buy something, but if I have to flag someone down and be treated poorly then forget it.  I will spend my money at another mac store.\n\nI was excited to come to this Mac store in particular because it is a pro store, which has more colors, body paint, mixing mediums than any other mac store.  But I will just wait till I get back to San Francisco to buy my stuff.  Don't think I will be buying anything from this location even if I come back to Vegas."
0,"We ate here because it was adjacent to the movie theatre at Town Square.  I think we shall also wait a bit before trying it again - if at all.  The decor/artwork, and atmosphere was attractive and interesting.  There was a live band playing mostly country music - with a great guitar player.  The music was so loud that we couldn't maintain conversation at the table.  The menu was interesting - we are not familiar with \""lowcountry food\"" but we thought several things on the menu sounded appealing.  Our party of two sixteen-year-old boys and two forty-somethings ordered the fried alligator and the cornmeal fried oysters with horseradish sauce.My SO ordered skillet fried flounder entree, which was served on a rice pilaf of some sort.  He kept reaching for the salt during the meal and afterwards claimed that he \""could have opened a frozen dinner and had a better meal than that.\""  I had a ceasar salad which was boring.  One teen ordered the mac and cheese and was picking at it so I asked if it was any good.  He replied, \""actually, it's not\"" and admitted that he didn't like the spices in it nor did he like the way the alligator had been flavored.  The other teen liked his pulled pork sandwich.  All in all, a disappointing meal for $82+tip.  And that was with three waters and an iced tea!  When we got home, we agreed that it was too bad that we were disappointed because the restaurant has a lot of potential.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong menu items?  Then I read the previous posts.  Hope Louis' can fix their problems and I also hope their other upscale restaurant at Town Square offers better fare!  Dare we try it?"
0,"It is out of expectation for all dishes with high price..and long line \nYes, it has more international foods selection \nBut it cost about $52.00 per\nI spent 2 hours and can not tasted all....\nThe quality is poor .. It is not yummy at all..\nThe brisket and sausages are overcooked..\n\nEven you can sitting in but has been with another long line for seafoods and prime rib line...\nIt is not worth it for that $ and spent time\n the long line ..\nIt was so disappointed !!!"
1,"Great new spot in the Bethany neighborhood. Great games and cocktails, like it's sister bar Little Woody's!"
1,"4.5 Stars... I really enjoyed Beckett's table! It's a large, cool looking room with exposed ceiling and brick walls. They have a small patio and I heard they're planning to build a large patio on the side of the building. \n\nI met a couple friends there and we shared a few different items: \n\nThe drink list has some great looking combos and a nice variety of wines. I tried the Palmaire, a lemonade/pomegranite combo. Very refreshing! \n\nWe had the grilled cheese with pancetta to start... I love a good grilled cheese and these were perfect little bites. It came with roasted red pepper tomato soup. The soup tasted like pureed roasted red peppers; I would have preferred a little more balance with tomato taste. \n\nThe roasted brussel sprouts were sumptuous; intense flavor and a little crisp on the outside. \n\nThe fire roasted green chile pork stew was very tasty. The corn bread that came with had a perfect sweet contrast. I tried a bite of my friend's short rib - very tender and lean. \n\nWe ended with the creme brulee, which came with fresh blackberries. At first I passed on having bites (I'm not a huge fan of creme brulee), but they pressured me into trying it... YUM! I may be a convert now. \n\nOverall, a great pick! Shout out to Katie B. for the suggestion."
0,"Three words, service, service, service and this place sucks at all three. I mean horrible. Stopped by for drinks and appetizers at the bar - only three other patrons in the whole place and it still took 15 minutes for a beer and margarita. Longer on refills. And there are 4 people just standing around. The Manager, at least that's who I think he was, lose the baseball cap and sunglasses- seriously, this isn't your living room. Owners, wake up and visit your place, this is going to go under."
1,I went for a Saturday afternoon World Cup game for third place between Germany and Uruguay.  Most tables in front of the screen were taken but not packed so it wasn't too noisy.  Service was really slow but the waitress was authentic.  Not the best review since I ordered a salad at a pub but the salad was good & fresh.  I tried the sweet potato fries too.  The fries were a little soggy but will go back under different circumstances to try them out since the beer selection is extensive and within walking distance.
1,Yep...loved it.  One of my favorite clubs along wiht Body English in vegas.  The whole layout of this place is well thought out.  The waterfall is HUGE to the entire experience.  Makes it so much more refreshing and enjoyable.  We got a table outside near the waterfall and really had a good time.  It gave us the chance to get away from the crowd and have quality time drinking with friends and when we wanted to dance we could go inside easily.  \n\nOne other thing is the bottle service here is not like any other place we have seen.  They are extremely attentive and just go far and beyond what we would expect.  Definitely coming back.
1,"Really great sushi, friendly staff and nice cold beer.  The television is always playing something innapropriate for the place, and loudly which is a big distraction to the guests. It is terribly expensive and the atmosphere is very plain.  Still, the food and service is very good and this is the only good sushi place in the area."
1,"The food here was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I both enjoyed our meals very much. I had the Panang curry and she had the pineapple rice. As per our custom, we sampled eachother's foods and couldn't decide which one we liked better. I also enjoyed a (reasonably priced) Thai tea with my meal. If you're in the Scottsdale area and have a hankering for some Thai food, this is definitely a place to check out!"
1,"very nice store, they have everything u need\nnice people to do Business with."
1,"I was running out of contacts and needed to get my eyes checked anyway. In the past, I always went to Costco. With my new insurance plan, I had to find a doctor that was covered under my plan. They had a few great reviews and this place is a few minutes from where I live. \n\nThe inside was not what I was expecting at all. Their website looks a little outdated and there were no pictures on Yelp. The office had a lot of designer glasses on display and it was very bright and updated. The staff that I interacted with were all very nice too. \n\nThe exam went pretty well, nothing too out of the ordinary. They have some cool high-tech gadgets that I've never seen before though. The contact ordering process was pretty smooth too. The man who helped me even hooked me up with a rebate that Acuvue was offering on the contacts that I like. They offer to ship your contacts to you for free or you can pick them up. Living in a condo, I didn't want my contacts sitting out in the heat for hours so I opted to pick them up in the store. They came in pretty quickly and I was given a call when they had arrived.\n\nThe only reason that I'm not giving them 5 stars is because I felt like it was a little pricey. I'll have to do more research and comparisons on price when it comes time for my next exam to decide if I will be returning here again."
1,"Excellent,\nShaken beef, beef stew, Cornish hen, garlic noodles, crispy egg rolls and garlic butter edamame all rock!"
1,Wonderful coffee!  Very good wifi. Some outdoor seating.
1,"My go to park in the SW area when bringing kids that are just too energetic for me to handle. The jungle gym area is a cool western theme and is big enough for groups of children to run around and enjoy. There's see saws, spring horses, a tangled rope play area, a tower that overlooks the park, a swing set, some slides, and a water play area. The grass fields are real grass hills that feel cool under your feet. You could roll down them in a race like kids. There is a volleyball court too.\n\nWhen I can't make it to the gym or I want to do a quick cardio hike, I go here. The trail to the top is steep, but manageable. If you're going to go up it, wear good shoes. Your ankles might slip if you wear flip flops."
0,yikes - I guess it is true that this place is a hit or a miss.\n\nServed a raw goat burger - and then I was served a way over cooked goat burger. It came as a recommendation of the server but it was terrible even flavor-wise.\n\nAwful service- and I paid $24 for a meal  I threw out when I got home.\n\nI doubt I would go back ...
0,"This chef actually gave me a speech about how there is no scientific evidence that GMO's are unsafe.  This Chef actually wanted to debate with me about O R G A N I C foods.  I walked in and I had 1 simple question.   Do you use O R G A N I C ingredients at all? This was my first and last time I will ever set foot in that place.  He was very cocky and full of pride as he pointed to a machine on the shelf above him... he washes away all the pesticides,  said that he ONLY USES  CONVENTIONAL ingredients and doesn't believe in anything  O R G A N I C.  He was very rude.  He talked over me as I explained that conventional vegetables and fruits, etc. have been modified with DNA that modifies DNA in our bodies... didn't even let me finish, instead he continued his speech that it is washed away... YOU CANNOT WASH AWAY MUTANT DNA that was injected in the seeds and the plants to make it frankenfood... SPREAD THE WORD!!"
0,"Bad selection & owner wouldn't even look at items I brought in to sell because she \""wasn't accepting anymore at  this time.\""  She also ordered lunch on the phone in front of me when I entered the store. Not the way to run a high-end boutique!"
0,"Was there with a party of 8, 4adults 4kids nice atmosphere and clean from the entrance to the washrooms. Food was average for the price although the salad they include with the meal was awful soggy oil drenched lettuce, the worst part was the souvlaki plate (at a Greek restaurant). The meat was dry and burnt the pita was overfilled with tzatziki, the tomatoes in the pita were cut in huge quarters like in a Greek salad, lazy lazy . The lamb chops were tasty but again overcooked, the rib steak was worth the price but again overcooked not to or request. Certainly a rotisserie can get one meat cooked to request. As for the rest of the appetizers the spinach pie was great, the fried zucchini and eggplant was tasteless, not impressed for a place I heard so much about. I would be weary of giving this place another chance, but because I've heard many recommendations I probably will, maybe on a slower night."
1,"Clean rooms, and decent prices throughout the year. We stayed the second night of Memorial Day weekend here, and took the cab to the strip. Much better than one of the cheapo places closer to the action. Our bathroom shower even had a view of The Strip! The rooms are large, and the beds are comfortable and clean. ****\n\nThe casino itself feels new if you don't compare it to the brand new locations on The Strip, and has a great screening area for big games. The only downside outside of location is that it's clientele is a mix of families and seniors. Not very lively. ****"
0,"Recently purchased pork shoulder Boston butt from Sam's and the package was not properly marked. The package didn't indicate that the product was bone in. This package of meat sold for$2.48/lb. Same product from Frys sells for$1.99/lb. I don't see the discount savings. I called manager and was told product came from vendor and Sam's had no control over labeling,  of course manager didn't offer to give me a credit for my purchase. That was nearly $5.00 difference,  guess I'll have to be more vigilant of what I purchase from Sam's in the future."
0,"Tropical themed restaurant.  Been here for buffets which were decent.  Wanting to avoid the long buffet line, we opted to be seated for the cafe.  Getting seats for 6 seemed to be a challenge.  We were directed to the back and was told someone would be waiting for us to seat us.  Alas, no one was so we just seated ourselves.  What appeared to be confusion as another server asked us if we were supposed to be seated there or not.  Turns out, it was the right place.  Anyway, we waited....hmmmm... quite a while.  It seemed longer withTWO antsy toddlers who weren't shy about declaring their state of hunger.  The waiter hurriedly walked by and said he'd be right there.  He appeared to be on the verge of a hissy fit.   \nWe waited AGAIN even longer.  Finally, annoyed with the wait since we had just arrived to Vegas after roadtripping 5 hours, I walked over to the waiter station and asked for someone to bring us drinks.  \nA minute later, our huffy server shows up with no greeting and asks us for our drink order.  We were already ready to order.  \nAgain,  another long wait.  I looked at my watch and noticed it's been over 20 minutes with NO DRINKS!  This has been my worst experience at the Fremont Hotel.  Again, I walked over to the wait station and asked for assistance. \nAbout another few minutes go by and then our drinks arrive.  No apology or explanation about the delay.  \nThen our food arrives.  Now, the food was ok.  The American cuisine was pretty good.   But how do you screw up a patty melt or fried saimin noodles anyway? The Asian iterations could have been better.  The Korean ribs were not authentic.  Ok,if you like your bbq really sweet or never had true Korean marinated ribs.  \nWe noticed patrons who arrived long after us who already received their drinks and their food arrived at about the same time as ours.  NICE....\nWhile we were finishing up our food, the server tells us he's going on a break and that \""so and so\"" would take care of us.  Well it was a while before we saw this person since usually, we're introduced to the new server.\nAnyway, this new server couldnt have been nicer.  She had a friendly disposition and almost simulataneously, hubby and I exclaimed we should have had her as our server plus our original server was going on a break?   It appeared he went on a break while we waited for our drinks.  Funny thing is, we devoured our food and was out of there so soon after we received our entrees.   \nThe new server was more empathatic and tried to explain how slammed they were with a new cook and that the previous patrons gave our server a difficult time.  My point was that it doesnt take THAT long to bring drinks and explain the situation.  Plus, why are we being punished because of other high maintenance sh**heads!!!  If the food was really crappy, I would give 1 star but the buffets I've experienced in the past were decent.  At the rate we were going, we could have just waited for the buffet...it may have been faster!"
0,Never going to any Hooters again. 1) Flat Ass everywhere. Eat some of the wings and do some squats. 2) They increased the price of the endless wings for the new year yet the wings got smaller. The manager said that it is because they are being charged more. They might want to think about changing suppliers then. 3) To charge for every ranch dressing is asinine. We asked for one ranch each and she brought us a ranch every time we got our next plate of six tiny wings. Never did our server Ashlea tell us we were going to have to pay for each ranch that we did not even ask for. At least the beer was good and at a decent price. I think we will stick to Zipps!
0,"I'm normally a fan of PF Changs but this experience was not good at all!  I wanted to take my mother since she had never been.  I always bring home food for her to try.  This was not what I hoped her first PF Changs experience would be! \n\nThe beef with broccoli was over cooked, and when we asked about it we were told that's how it's ALWAYS made.  The Mongolian Beef was overlooked as well.  I had a cup of wonton soup...lets face it you can't really mess that up!\n\nOverall the service was less than stellar,the waitress was a bit rude. When the manager came over to speak with us we were asked had we ever been to PF Changs? I asked why he wanted to know he said because we were asking about the food and explained to me how PF Changs is not a \""typical\"" Chinese restaurant.  I explained to him I was a regular at my local location and have NEVER had beef cooked to the point it was basically beef jersey, nor had I ever been treated like that in a restaurant.  \n\nI will continue to frequent the PF Changs in the PH hotel/casino, but will NOT go back to this location!"
1,"TruFusion is a beautifully modern twist on yoga and boot camp!\n\nAs the name implies TruFusion is not your typical yoga studio.  There are a lot of hybrid classes offered here that are based on yoga, pilates, bootcamp, trx, etc.  Many of them are a blend that combine other disciplines as well, though they do offer a few more traditional experiences as well.  The facility is absolutely gorgeous, modern, and clean.  Each room has a different feel ranging from soothing candlelight ambiance, to no-nonsense workout attack.  The staff is helpful and friendly.  While the clientele is fun and laid back...still this seems a bit like a place to see and be seen. \n\nThe list of classes displays the abundance of styles offered at TruFusion:\nAcoustic Candlelight Yoga\nAshtanga \nBattle Ropes Express\nBlack Light Yoga/Pilates \nHip Hop Booty Pop\nHot Power Flow Yoga\nHot Yoga Blues\nKettleBells\nKettlebell Fusion\nMoving Meditations\nTRX 2.0\nTRX Bootcamp 60\nTru Barefoot Bootcamp\nTru TRX\nTru Trigger Point\nTru Yin\nTru-acro-yoga\nTruHot Pilates\nTruZumba\nVinyasa Flow Yoga\nYin Fused\n\n...whats more though is that they roll out special one time classes every so often as well...just in case you needed to mix things up a bit more!  I really enjoyed a punk rock revolution yoga session that was bold and in the face of the man as we flowed to a ton of classic punk!\n\nIn addition to a wide variety of classes the facility really is special here...from the classes to the locker room to the entryway, no part was not intentionally prepared to heighten your experience.\n\nCheck out a free class you first stop in.  I am partial to the yoga stylings of Jennifer Knox, but there are several great instructors depending on what you're into."
0,"Layover of two hours so our family chose Chili's Too for a quick lunch. Menu is abbreviated and prices are elevated. Service is less than friendly and slooowwww.\nWe ordered basics (burgers, chicken sandwich, kids meal). Our son (age 6) thought he saw something 'yucky' in his kids meal halfway through eating and it made him sick and he threw up a couple of bites of food on the floor...nothing horrendous but chewed up food...standard stuff to any parent. I informed the waitress and she said that she 'wasn't allowed to touch it' and would get the manager. The manager arrived ten minutes later and had a look of compete disgust on her face. She placed some plastic gloves on the table along with a takeout box and a few paper towels and asked us to clean it up and place the paper towels in the box!! Seriously?! I asked if there was a mop or anything and she shook her head and walked off! I refused to clean it up. I'm a nurse and wouldn't expect a patient to clean up his own vomit...it's part of my job! Clean up is part of the job of any establishment! If the guy at the bar spilled his beer, would they ask him to clean it up?! My kind husband wiped most of it up and placed it in the box and we left...no tip, no positive thoughts on the Chili's Too! We fly frequently through Charlotte and will not be eating here again!"
0,It was my first time going to TAO and all I can say it was the worst experience ever. TAO is such a small environment and honestly if there was a fire or earthquake it would be a disaster. The club was over capacity and they kept on allowing people in.
0,"I have heard so many good things about this place, had to give it a try\n\nUGH, expectations are a bad thing to have sometimes....\n\nordered a few dishes\nstarted with the cheese plate selection....bad\nthe one that sticks out was a goat cheese brie???? positively awful, kind of what I would imagine a urinal cake tasting like....had to spit out in napkin...that bad\n\nwent on to apple and fennel salad, again bad choice\nnot sure how you screw up this one, maybe a bit heavy handed with Sherry/vinegar?\nin any case, sent this back as well\n\nthird, tried the cauliflower, which was cooked ok, but the dusting of paprika kind of killed the taste for us\n\nfourth came the lamb, probably the only edible dish of the night, cooked well, but a bit heavy handed with the salt.....edible at least\n\nfifth, the paella with various vegetables, which they told us into our meal was not available (went bad?)\noffered us the remaining available one, chicken and rabbit, but by that time we were pretty much done with this place, and why take the second best of only two choices of paella available that night?\n\nI can say that the service was decent, and that even though we did not have a good meal....or any meal at all, the manager was extremely attentative. It was refreshing that he came to our table after the first two dishes were taken away and he noticed we had not touched much of either. I really hate to give the place such a low rating based on his concerns. Not too many places would show such concern, and especially on the strip, most would probably have just let us suffer. He took care of the check as well, which was appreciated.\n\nI have had friends rave about this place, so maybe in future we might give it another shot, but there are so many choice in Vegas now, hard to give this a second try......."
0,"My husband and I have been \""regulars\"" at Yasu since we discovered it. However, given the poor treatment we received last week, we will not be returning.  We were entertaining 2 business associates and I called around 4 pm to ensure hours and make a reservation. I was told that I wouldn't need a reservation for four around 6:30 pm. We arrived promptly at 6:30, but were told that it would be at least an hour wait. I spoke with the manager about the phone call, noting recognition in his eyes, but he told me that he couldn't do anything at all to help us because he had taken several reservation after I called. I mentioned that I was specifically told that I wouldn't need a reservation. He said he would be happy to make a reservation for me if I call in the future. Well, that just won't be happening. He then scurrried away and hid at the bar, allowing his equally rude hostess to deal with us, even after asking to speak with him again. The immature way in which this incident was handled leads me to believe that Yasu can't make good when they make a mistake. If they just would have made some accomodation to note the mistake of not giving me a reservation, I would not be posting this, but just can't let this go and felt my fellow diners should beware - you're SOL if Yasu makes a mistake."
0,"So I'm very dissappointed in the service and probably won't be back unfortunately. My mother and I decided to try this locale out, since I haven't since living on this side of town. \n\nWell we waited a couple minutes before anyone approached us to seat us, and then waited an additional minutes before the guy came back to give us menus. I was trying to give the guy the benefit of the doubt considering they seemed to be a lil busy but this was just a series of issues to come.\n\nI ordered the italian beef hero which was actually really good but they didn't provide enough au jus, so i seriously waited forever and a day till the guy decided to come check up on us and see how we were doing. Come to find out he was only waiting on my table and two others (that came in after us), and making coversartion in the back with the employees which was the reason why there was such delay to assist us. When he finally did make it around and I commented the need for more au jus he said he'd be back witha  refill for my mother and my au jus. Well he passed us literally 5X's before he goes, \""OH! The Au Jus\"". I mean come on dude where the heck is your head at?!\nAfter we were done with our meals, we decided we may attempt to go for some dessert so instead of waiting for him to bring the menu we walked over to the podium and grabbed one our selves. He came by and asked if we'd found something else and I asked him for a refill while we decide.\n\nHe again went behind the bar and started convo with another employee and trying to somewhat multi task- and this is where he f'd up. He took my drink and walked over to this senior couples table and put my drink down and went back to converse with the employee AGAIN. I then had to call him out and told him to come over to our table. I told him he just took my drink over to the other table and that I now longer want a refill or dessert, just my bill. \n\nI was really disappointed- I definitely won't be back. To be honest as soon as we sat down I looked up the locale on Yelp and started to see the negative comments and was like, eh I'll give it try, maybe they just happened to hit them on a bad day, but that wasn't the case the service is just bad."

1,Get the special. It is always good. The wait to get into here can be long but it is worth the wait.
0,"For the price you pay you wouldn't expect mediocre music ON A LOOP with a good song thrown in here and there. They drop foam (soap suds) from the ceiling because I guess some people like soap in their drinks and messing up their hair. We had bottle service with a very unpleasant server, a worker knocked over our bottle of Belvedere (which we paid $375 for) onto one of my friends, never apologized, the server handed my wet friend about 5 cocktail napkins instead of getting him a towel, still no apology. Remaining calm, I reminded the manager how much we paid for that bottle and he gave us a free bottle of some unknown vodka which tasted awful. Not to mention, the server took away what was left of the Belvedere. Oh and the go-go dancers are a bit over-the-top queeny but perhaps I'm just spoiled by the LA go-go dancers."
0,I ordered Pad Thai with beef A La Cart. First thing I noticed was it was a small portion.  Second thing was there wasn't much beef. Beef was a little tough but for the most part it was tasty. Different from many Thai places.\n\nI also ordered a large Tom Yum soup with chicken. Standard size amount. This too was prepared differently than most places. Chicken was tough and flavor was ehhhh \n\nPlace has seats for inside eating but restaurant is designed for take out.\n\nSmall portion sizes along with the cost makes this an undesirable place for me to return. For $23 ...I expected more
1,"Great tailoring hands down. I've had jeans taken in, dresses altered and hems taken up - all perfectly done. I will say, though, that you get what you pay for, i.e. it's not affordable tailoring.  A pair of jeans cost $20 to be taken in, and $20 for hemmed pants or dress. While I personally think it's worth it for expert tailoring, others may think it's a bit overpriced for some of the basic tailoring. \n\nAlso, the staff are all very nice and will give very helpful tailoring advice when asked. You can trust your nicest pieces here - they are in good hands!"
1,6 months ago my grandma had us goto coco's. yuk. So when we came to visit again i told my wife anything but coco's dennys etc... It was funny because we where suggesting chilis and black angus and she would bring up coco' each time. but i told my wife i am done with those type of places. So we got to goto chili's :-) i ordered the memphis dry rub ribs. Ive had them before and i love the flavor. The ribs where kind of dry and i had to rip the meat off the bone. It wasnt as dry as famous daves though. The ribs i got near home at chilis are a 5 but i can only give this one a 4.
1,"My absolute favorite place to eat when on the West Coast. There is NOTHING better than a Double Double with Cheese, Animal Style! I'm not big into the fries, and your order WILL take a while to be made, but it is totally worth it. I introduced my boyfriend to this while we were in LA and he's in love. Counting the days until I return to the US for that delicious burger!"
0,"We were told that they only had wheat and the standard breads for the 'pressed sandwiches'. That was a lie. They only had wheat. When I said \""You just said you had bread for the pressed sandwiches\"", I was told they just ran out. Nobody was in front of us. So, who took the last of the two types of breads for the pressed sandwiches? How can a sandwich shop run out of every type of bread except wheat by mid-day? They said that they had been out of the other bread for over 3 hours. WHAT?!? Extremely poor planning and horrible handling of the customers. We love you, Tom. But, you really need to get a handle on this place."
1,"Growing up in the NYC area... This spot, more than any other pizza joint in the valley reminds me most of home. The thin, crispy crust is on point. The savory tomato sauce and melty cheese are perfect. Only thing is... Make sure the slice has cooled down enough to eat it. I burn my mouth pretty much every time I'm here. The pies here are \""da\"" business!"
1,"Been going here for almost a decade.  Never had any problems.  Very affordable, speedy cleaning and I don't have that funky after-drycleaning stiff feeling you'd normally get at these cheap $2.29 cleaners.  (You know what I'm talkin' about)  \n\nThey really do a great job and don't damage your clothes by putting stickers on your clothes like they do at the \""organic drycleaners\"".  Just a safety pin with a piece of paper on the clothing label. \n\nThey only accept cash or checks. Worse case scenario, you can use the ATM they have inside their store."
1,"My husband and I first recognized Tigerlily because it was conveniently located outside our window at the hotel Roxburghe. After dinner with some friends at a different establishment a friend who was familiar with Edinburgh suggested Tigerlily. I was extremely tired because I had flown in from the US that morning and had remembered that it was across the street from our hotel...so I agreed to go for a drink or two (knowing I could leave when I wanted and just hop across the street and go to bed). \n\nIt was a Thursday night about 12:30...I guess they close at 1 so they warned us at the door and told us we were welcome to come in and then continue our fun late late night at their sister nightclub downstairs Lulu. We came in and had a few drinks at the front bar. The service was attentive yet the drinks were considerably weak, I guess you just have to ask for doubles. Even though, a half hour into our stay we were having so much fun that we decided to go downstairs and completely had forgotten about our jet-lag. Oh, and Tigerlily's decor is super modern and trendy, definitely one of the \""coolest\"" places I have been in awhile. When we arrived downstairs we were sat at a corner table with some friends who were celebrating getting married that weekend. We had a blast! Our server, even in this crazy nightclub was attentive, but gave us enough space and she came over when we needed something. The Dj was great and open to suggestions (and actually played them). That was our FIRST visit to Tigerlily and Lulu.\n\nWe had so much fun that Thursday we decided to bring different friends in on Friday. We were all staying at the Roxburghe like I said before so it was easy to get people to decide to go. On this visit we ventured to the bar in the back of the restaurant. This place on a Friday in July was PACKED! It was awesome. Lots of people my age, mid-twenties to mid-thirties, having cocktails with friends and family and most very good-looking. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. The bartenders in the back bar were great (well the guys). They always remembered what my husband and I were drinking and even though they were busy they were still very attentive. Also, after one round we opened a tab, they give you this number so you can tell them your tab number instead of your name (very cool!) and the bartenders remembered my tab number! AWESOME! They only thing I noticed was the female bartender, very pretty, but she was either new to the establishment or a new bartender altogether because it took this poor girl seriously 10 minutes to open a bottle of wine for a customer at the bar and then another 10 minutes to give them a check, probably 30 minutes in customer years (I'm a bar owner in the US). I think it would have impacted my experience had I been waiting for a drink like a lot of other people, but because of the male bartenders I was taken care of already. I know tipping isn't customary in the UK but I felt like my service was so excellent that I had to! \n\nSo to recap... Great decor, great service (at both Lulu and Tigerlily), good drinks. The only thing that was missing was that I never tried the food. Maybe next time I'm in Edinburgh. :)"
1,"After reading so many wonderful reviews, I thought I would check out Trader Joe's. I haven't lived near one before so I was intrigued and excited to shop somewhere new and possibly help out on spending less for groceries. This store is fairly new and my GPS did not pick up the street name; however, it is conveniently located on Charlottetown and Kings (in the same shopping area as Best Buy). \n\nFor my first time being in a Trader Joe's, it took me a moment to get acquainted. It was smaller in size than other grocery stores I've been to and it didn't seem to have well labeled areas because it took me a while to locate what I needed. I went in with a pretty lenthy list and found that it didn't have everything I was looking for (i.e., jalape\u00f1o, cream of mushroom soup) or offer a wide variety to select from (i.e., one type of sour cream). In addition, some of the labels look similar (e.g., writing, style, color) and it took me longer to distinguish which product was organic, free-range, etc. \n\nPrevious reviewers mentioned that it has lower prices than some of the other higher end stores (e.g., TJ's peanut butter is approximately $1 less than what I've found at other stores). I agree that many items are less expensive, but not all items. Since I wasn't able to find everything on my list at TJ's I went back to Earth Fare to get the rest. I found that some things at EF were either less or similar to the same cost (e.g., TJ's unsalted butter was $1 more and blue corn chips were the same cost).\n\nPast my criticisms...I found that I am a fan of Trader Joe's! If you bring your own bag, they enter you into a drawing to possibly be the winner of $25 worth of Trader Joe's products. In addition, I like the beautiful selection of flowers that greets you the moment you walk in. I appreciated that the store was bright and clean as well. They have a nice wine section and you may find yourself spending a while trying to select the \""right\"" one. The employees are very helpful and friendly! And if you know prices of products you regularly purchase, you can distinguish which are less expensive at TJ's and help out your pocketbook.\n\nIf you are in need of quick, staple items Trader Joe's is a great choice. If, however, you need specific things and want a variety of options you may want to go to a bigger store."

0,"I have been wanting to try this place for a really long time and I can say its Meh.  I was so excited but sadly disappointed.  First of all they don't have fountain drinks so  our drinks were from a can or plastic bottle. We  got the spicy pork (lunch) for $9.99, it was bland, lettuce wrap $5.99 but didn't get the chilli peppers, and 2 spicy tuna rolls. At first our waitress only put in for 1 order so we had to wait. The rolls were big and fat for $4.50 and worth the price. I love it when the tuna is still cold and the rice is slightly warm. That's the only thing that save Gogi from 1 star.  The spicy tuna was the BEST thing here.  I would ONLY come back for that."
0,"Okay, I do not hand out one stars very often... Here goes:\n\nFirst I want to say we were a party of 7 and there was a 2 top that was there and a 8 top that already had their food. \n\nFood: Last time I checked there weren't potatoes in Minestrone soup. However my vegetable soup (Minestrone) had decent flavor, not very many vegetables. My husband had the special, Linguine Pescatore (assorted seafood, scallops, shrimp, mussels, calamari)... he ate it all no complaint. My cousin had some Angel Hair Pasta dish, one bite pushed it aside and wouldn't take another bite. What kind of waiter doesn't inquire what is the matter? (she was worried about sending food back) My friend said the meatballs had good flavor. Another said the Veal Parmesan was really salty. \nService: There was a guy, I think he was the Busser, he had a pony-tail. He was very helpful and ran his tail off. We waited a really long time for our food. It did warn us on our menu that the food takes awhile  because it's made to order... I get that, but it was longer than I have EVER waited. Our Waiter was not very helpful and only saw him 2 times... he took our order and brought our check. (I will get to that later)\n\nBeverages: House Cabernet at 9.00 a glass... I probably could have bout the case at Costco for that price.  Not the most generous pour, then again why would I want more of it. My husband and another gentleman had 6 beers (total)  54.00 before tax and tip. There are no prices on their beer selection. \n\nNow this is where the real issue comes in... \n\nThey do not have a computer, so the writing on the check is really messy. If we didn't try to separate our check ourselves we wouldn't have noticed that they charged us for 8 meals instead of 7. He took the check and counted the meals on the check and then pointed his finger as if a teacher in pre-school counting the 7 of us. I think I can count, he served us, he should know how many of us there was. I am hoping it was an accident. My issue is that he only brought out 7 plates... he didn't even bring us 8. So I am questioning his honesty. Then he deducted the 24.00 for the mistake from the total. I had to ask him to deduct the tip and tax for the meal also. \n\nBottom line, if one of the guys that he gave the check to just slapped down his credit card without looking the waiter could have pocketed another 26.50, besides that 51.00 he got for the tip that was added in. \n\nService was terrible,  Most of the food not worth they money. Atmosphere was super quite and dreary. I found this place on Yelp, I am very disappointed fellow Yelpers!!!!"
0,"I'm sorry, but these four and five star reviews are a bit much for this place.  The cookies are good, but nothing earth shattering.  Plus, when you are charging almost $2 (ridiculous!) a cookie...they better be the best I've had, and they just aren't.  \n\nIf Paradise Bakery charges almost $1.50 per cookie then I'd say these cookies should have a street value of about $1.  Sorry, but I'll take a Paradise Bakery Cookie over an Urban cookie any day."
1,"I hung out here with friends who were tired and contemplating going to the Beauty Bar to see a band, but we ended up here instead.  The fireplaces were nice, the cocktails were strong (apparently, since I was drinking Fat Tire).  The regulars were \""fun\"" to watch.  I had a good time."
1,"My experience today at Sun Devil auto. Was remarkably wonderful. I started this morning looking for a auto shop to help me with the truck. In my third stop was the Sun Devil auto shop. I am mediately was acknowledged. By the staff. Mr Francisco Torres, ask me what brought me in. I asked if they do a diagnostic in the truck. I also ask him you can do a check on the breaks well I have the truck and the shop. . \n\nI am mediately felt like I made the right choice. The extra care and attention was absolutely high quality coming from the staff member. Mr Francisco into step by step in show me every detail that I needed to know what kind of work the truck need it. I really appreciated that. Mr Francisco is very honest and not making an upsell. I make sure that I was driving safely on the road with a safe vehicle I will definitely keep my interest in the shop for as long as I live here in Arizona. I recommend this shop to all my friends and family honesty is the best policy."
1,"I love this place.  So refreshing, like eating snow."
0,Who do they think they are? The pricing is way out of line for the quality. This is not great sushi. I have had better suhsi from the supermarket. The food is not fresh and the yum-yum roll tasted like immitation crab meat. The ENSO sushi is pure Sysco restaurant supply as best and not at all fresh. I am very disappointed.
1,"This place is surrounded by car dealerships and the closest other \""business\"" is a place where people who got in trouble by Johnny Law have to talk to counselors about why they got in trouble in order to appease the court and have their crime forgiven.  Anyway, that's just kind of setting the scene for this place and its surroundings.\n\nBurger Mania is just sort of depressing.  It has weird decorations, like this Uncanny Valley hot dog statue that is covering itself in mustard and ketchup and looking right into your eyes, begging to be eaten so that it can end its miserable life.  It wants the sweet, sweet release of death so badly.  For some reason, below the neon sign reading \""Burger Mania\"" with burnt out letters, there's these weird, I don't know, mascots, one of which is a dinosaur.  \n\nAll that said, the food is actually pretty good.  It was kind of amazing!  It's nothing extraordinary, no, not by any means... and if you're expecting that from a place called Burger Mania, god help you... but, grading on a curve, they deserve four stars.  Given all the places that look as depressing as this one, hardly any of them actually deliver on any sort of promise to actually have good food.  This one does.  And it's pretty inexpensive."
0,"I was invited to come to this place on the spur of the moment.  I probably should have declined, but I do like Indian food and I figured I could order off the menu.  Yes, they do have a buffet here, but I hate buffets.\n\nAllow me to digress about buffets briefly.  The first problem with them is that they encourage me to eat too much.  I always want to get my money's worth, so I stuff myself.  Not great.  Second problem is a bit more gross.  Any idea how many people wash their hands after going to the bathroom?  Maybe half?  And here is a row of food trays with utensils being handled by literally dozens of people, half of whom did not wash their hands recently.  And that doesn't include those who may be sick, or recently coughed/sneezed into their hands (without washing afterwards).  And those serving utensils are touching my food??  Uhhh...no.\n\nSo I order from the menu (more about the menu in a moment).  I'm not very hungry, so I just order a lentil soup with mixed vegetables in it (Sambar).  The waitress proceeds to the buffet line, grabs a bowl, and ladles the soup from the buffet into the bowl.  There's my sambar.  Served with one of those potentially toxic utensils I just mentioned.  Ugggh!  I wanted it from the kitchen where only one or two people who haven't washed their hands will handle it!!!!  Not cool.\n\nThe service itself was inattentive.  They seemed a bit understaffed.  Maybe someone missed work so they were short-handed?  Dunno.  But it was inattentive.  What interaction we did have with the servers was friendly.  The soup was very flavorful, but very lacking in lentils.  I expected to see lentils.  It was mostly broth with a few pieces of vegetable in it.  Disappointing.\n\nAnd now for the menu...it featured a large variety of dishes.  That bit was good.  But every section that involved meat indicated the meat was halal.  Some argue that halal meat is more humane, but I do not believe that is true.  There are a few brief religious ceremonies/utterances that must be done before slaughtering the animal, but basically they hang it upside down and slit its throat while it's still conscious.  It then bleeds-out (probably at least 20-30 seconds before it passes out).  I do not see how that is more humane than the typical western method of stunning the animal first, then stringing it up and cutting the throat.  There is no suffering in the latter (if it's done properly).  I'm not squeamish about slaughtering an animal for food, and I do know where meat comes from.  The only reason to do it halal is religious, and I have a problem with inducing suffering without very good reason.  Ancient traditions that aren't really relevant to modern hygiene do not qualify in my opinion.  I'm not criticizing others' beliefs, but I do not share them and don't think I should have to partake in them.\n\nThey have plenty of vegan dishes, and that's fine.  My soup I believe was vegan.  I do wish she had brought me a fresh one from the kitchen instead of one from the buffet line.  Prices seemed a tad high to me, too.  But the place was busy, and clearly very popular with Indian people (most patrons appeared to be Indian)."
1,Love their carne asada tacos! We have never had anything but great quick service and good food from mi casita. One of the workers was telling me they will probably close down when their lease is up and I truly hope they don't.
0,Don't go here if you want an authentic Harley shirt as you'll be disappointed. They sell Harley Davidson Cafe t-shirts.
0,I have mixed feelings. I love the food but the restaurant is ran by kids. You ask them a question and they look at you like a deer in headlights and unable to provide a solution. In the future if you have a large party please offer a solution for example: employee: I'm sorry and we appreciate you coming in we are very busy. I have a few options are you ok with splitting your party up or we have available outside seating. Only option we were left with was to leave. It's sad business owners don't appreciate the power and importance of customer service.
0,"Took my puppy here after seeing the great reviews. Unfortunately the dog groomer Bo, had cut my dogs eye then argued with saying that I brought my dog in this way. I now have to put three different types of medicated drops in my dogs eyes because of a mistake he made. We have yet to hear from the owner abut the situation."
1,"They left us a delivery menu under the door to our room at the Rio. It said 'fast delivery' and they were open till 5am. We ordered a Large Supreme Pizza and Wings + Fries. Total was $36 + tip.\n\nThe pizza was freaking huge! It was flavorful, the ingredients seemed fresh and it was pretty delicious! But my favorite thing were the wings! We ordered mild, but they were pretty spicy. Despite the heat, they were tasty, fried to a crispy goodness and big! They've probably made it to my top 5 favorite wings list. \n\nHere are the downers: The delivery wasnt really 'fast'. HOWEVER, I understand I need to add some extra time because the driver needs to find parking and then trek up to our room, right? So the hour it took to get our pizza was probably actually really reasonable.\n\n1 piece of dry celery and 2 pieces of carrot with my damn wing order? Disappointing for sure.\n\nOverall, Its about a 3.5 star for me. Yes, Id definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Vegas and wanting something other than hotel room service or restaurant food!"
1,"This is an extremely nice spa.  I had a facial and a mother to be massage while I was there and they were both fantastic.  The receptionist was very friendly and informative and both the facialist and masseuse I saw were friendly and professional.  The facility itself was beautiful and relaxing.  I do think they should consider a lighter weight robe for the summer months because walking around in a heavy thick robe when it is 107 degrees outside and not much cooler inside was quite unpleasant.  I was also surprised given the heat and the robes that I was offered hot tea.  I nearly laughed out loud as I could not think of anything that sounded worse at the time.  That being said to each their own.  If there is some wackadoo, nut job out there that wants to sit in 107 degree heat wearing a thermal robe drinking hot tea more power to them I suppose.  My only real complaint about this spa was the prices.  I have been to several other spas of this caliber and not one if them was this expensive.  On average it was at least 40-60 dollars more expensive per service.  Overall I would definitely return to this spa if I were ever in the area again.  Just one word of advice be sure they charge your spa services to the correct credit card.  I used my own card to book the spa services, and my husband used his company card to book our rooms in the resort and even though I told the girl checking me out that I did NOT want the services charged to the room somehow she did this anyway instead of to the card I used to book the services.  A simple mistake I'm sure and it was easily fixed once I found our what had happened.  I'm just glad my husband didn't have to try to explain why there were almost 300 dollars of spa charges on his company card!"
0,"Was looking forward to dinner here with girlfriends but was very disappointed. We arrived early with plenty of open seating but they sat us in the bar anyway.  Hostesses should gauge the type of diner when choosing a location in which to seat them, not just server load management. Not overly impressed with menu, especially the dinner salads...more like lunch-size, but tasty.  Waitress not very friendly, seemed indifferent at best.  Bar got crowded and\nbecame so noisy we could hardly hear each other.  Looks like a good place to go if you want to eat meat and drink, but not for a \nnice 'catch-up' dinner with friends. Used a Groupon to try the place... but probably won't be back."
0,"Want to see people change clothes??\n\n\nThe actors in this show look very much like the women they portray on stage.  Besides that, I can't really say anything positive about this drag show.  \n\nThe actors lip synch and move about the stage the entire show in their respective costumes.  I would have liked it much more if they were actually singing too.  \n\nFrank Marino, the host is comfortable on stage and charismatic, but his stale jokes feel used up and done to death.  They should really update some of the material, and consider adding some singing to the show.  \n\nI was very bored watching a group of actors wearing different outfits and lip synching.  I wouldn't recommend this show.  \n\nYou like Celine or Cher?  Chances are they're in town, go see them."
0,"They stopped making Canolis and they are inside of Anthony's it looks terrible with the checkered table cloths in Anthony's. It just looks weird to have this place inside a fine dining place.  You get confused as to Anthony's or Marinelli's. I do not like the high tables, very uncomfortable. It took Anthony's down several notches in my book!!! Just not the same."
0,"I wouldn't recommend anyone stay at this Low Quality Suites. I started to stay there, but couldn't finish. Not wouldn't. Couldn't! I was able to check in, unpack, shower, change and head to a football game at ASU. That's when my stay ended and some other dude's stay began.\n\nWhen I returned from the football game my room key wouldn't work, so I went and told the front desk attendant. The manager came over and for 5 minutes they looked at their computer together, at me (separately) and then back at the computer to share a WTF moment. When they found the courage, they advised me that they had mistakenly rented the room to someone else. The manager apologized and said he could give me a free room upgrade and proceeded to check me in. I said I wanted to get my things out of the room first.\n\nI went with the manager to my/our room. The manager tried the key, but couldn't get in. The door was apparently barricaded. He tried calling the room and either didn't get an answer or didn't like the answer. He knocked on the door and said, \""This is the manager\"", but the person inside just knocked back. We shared a WTF moment. I wanted my stuff, so I called the police. \n\nI waited outside while the Tempe police went in and talked to the manager, sharing a WTF moment. The police were finally able to get my roomie to open the door and let me in to collect my things, although he resisted a bit. Seemed to be a homeless man who thought he'd made a big score. Denied. My belongings in hand, the manager again offered to put me in a \""nicer\"" room. He understood when I told him what he could do with his \""nicer\"" room. \n\nAside from the horror, the problem with the Low Quality Suites is that it is a motel-type property being passed off as a 2-star hotel on travel sites. Read the previous negative reviews. All of those complaints apply, and when you add an incompetent staff that double books a room and then doesn't know how to resolve the problem, I feel obliged to leave my first ever feedback online about a hotel. I hope nobody else has to go through that."

0,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  wow nothing good to say at all about this dump. Ordered a dinner dish. A ceaser salad and spaghetti. They gave me iceberg lettuce (crap) with a side of ceaser dressing. About 30 minutes later my meal comes out.  Sauce was cold.. Ten min later they finally bring it back...ABSOLUTE garbage for being in seven hiLLS. OH and you get to see the employees smoke cigs outside while your eating right in front of them. Its all can good food..i'd rather eat at pizza hut or cicis
0,"Well, what can I say.  Wow!  This was the WORST restaurant experience that I have had in my 43 years on this earth.  I am not exaggerating.  It was very, very painful.\n\nIt started with the hostess.  A \""5-10\"" minute wait was all, she said.  25 minutes later we discovered that she had mistakenly crossed out our names.  OK, no problem, mistakes happen, we understand.  She says we get the next 2 person table.  Cool.  As we are waiting, I notice a couple being seated that came in much after us.  After some questioning, she allegedly crossed out their names too.  Umm, really???  The girl had no clue.\n\nFinally got seated and the waitress tells us the kitchen is backed up and to be patient.  OK, we are patient.  We order our food, a spicy chicken sandich and a tuna sandwich.  As we are waiting, and waiting, and waiting, we hear the waitress scolding customers.....\""I told you if you didn't order right away it would take longer, you chose to wait.  Really????   At another table she says the same thing.  The table next to us, once they get their food, complain and leave without even touching it.  Oh my!!!!\n\nApparently the kitchen is small and can't handle a crowd.  The 2 sandwiches mentioned above, took 70 minutes to get to us.....YES! 70 MINUTES!!!!!!!!  I can't believe we waited that long.  We were so mad, but at some point we were too invested.\n\nOnce the food comes.....no chips.  They will be along in a bit but they were not ready yet.  Really!!!!?????\n\nThe food was decent, no complaints there.  Every single table, though, was mad and upset about the wait.  It was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant, and I eat out A LOT!\n\nAnyway, stay away from this place.  They don't deserve your business.  This, by the way, is also the first \""bad\"" review I have ever written.. They should be ashamed!"
0,"Went here for a haircut today, hair dresser did a great job, Very friendly staff.\n\nHowever, when it came time to pay for my cut, I was informed that I could only pay for my haircut with my card, but my tip had to be left in cash.  Apparently, their terminal has a tip feature that can be turned on, but the management of the business refuses to do so.  \n\nI was recommended to use the ATM outside to take out a cash advance which would cost me extra bank fees since the ATM is not with my bank, not to mention the higher rate I would have to pay on a cash advance transaction vs. a sale.\n\nSuffice to say, this is a violation of MasterCard operating rules and I have filed a complaint with MasterCard.  If a business advertises MC acceptance and I present one for payment, you have to accept it for the full payment (including tip), end of story.\n\nI work in the Credit Card industry and it's very unusual for me to carry cash on me at all and was embarrassed to have to leave without tipping my hairdresser for a job well done. I will now have to return when I have cash on hand (another inconvenience to me) in order to pay out the tip he deserved.\n\nDebit and Credit cards are more secure, plain and simple and I shouldn't be forced to use cash at a business if they advertise the fact that they accept one of the cards in my wallet.\n\nI will not be returning to this establishment for this reason; it's a shame since I'd otherwise be more than happy to give business to the great people who work there."
1,"A very nice casino on the south end of the city.  There's definite pros & cons to staying here.\n\nPros: Spacious, attractive hotel room.  HDTV, couch, table, etc.  \n          Casino floor is huge and the carpet is comfortable to walk on.\n          There's a great Mexican Restaurant and a great big pool.\n           Bowling alley, movie theater, & arcade to keep kids occupied.\nCons: Far from the strip & paying $25 per cab ride either way to/from.\n            Buffet is bland - no taste...\n\nWorth your stay if you don't mind or would rather be away from the bustle of the strip.  Not worth it if you have to commute back drunk.  Busses stop running at midnight.  So plan ahead.  Best place to catch the bus is at Barbary Point."
1,"when me and the hubby is in the mood for some Thai food this is the spot we always go to.  I was introduced to this place by a friend of mines who has been going here for many years.  I've never been disappointed with any of their dishes.  But honestly we always seem to get the same  things chicken pad Thai, fried chicken, green curry and fried rice which seems to be the staple Thai food. \nmy parents were here for a short vacation and the also loved it! mind you it was there first time trying Thai food."

Haven't seen it this bad since 7th Avenue \""soul food\"" fried-till-they-bounce de-presented plate presentations.\n\nBYOB with no corkage fee. nice.\n\n# Stuffed chicken breasts were the usual sterroid- and hormone-induced gargantuonomous meat hunks which are sadly the norm these days. Boring.\n# \""Root vegetables\"" were these sad little dried plantain-things\n\nLittle better than amateur home-made.\n\nWith the closure of the best french bakery in metro phoenix, Is there *any* proper restaurant in this part of town?\n\nSorry, Flapjacks. Stick to breakfast?"
0,"Service was def 5 stars.  But the food was probably 1 star.\n\nAnd they are great at asking if you want more.  They were very accommodating with our kids.\n\nBut the fish and rice were def off.  And I mean really off.  I can't imagine it just being an off night because overall AYCE sushi is not that good and they weren't even close to being at the AYCE acceptable level.  I have pretty low standards for sushi.  I expected to be as good as Island Sushi and Grill in LV or Midori in Ventura County (CA).\n\nWorst hamachi, salmon, albacore nigiri that I've ever had.  White tuna was the best nigiri that I had that night.\nRolls were really bad.  I mean how do you mess up something that has mayo, sauce, and rice?  Too many to mention.\n\nThe tempura was just okay.  The quesadilla is a waste of food space.  The gyoza was good.\n\nWish the food was better because they are awesome people.\n\nOnly been to Island Sushi and Grill before Koma.  Island is good for AYCE (not great) but Koma isn't even as close.  If this place is really the 4.5 stars that everyone raves about, you should give everyone else 10 stars.  When I come back to LV without the kids I think we're going to have to Goyemon."
0,"New in Ahwatukee area and probably a great example of why Restaurants have such a great failure rate. A great concept very poorly executed!\n\nWhile my \""Test Breakfast\"" was absolutely awful, I was more interested in the comments of the people around me. \n\n\""Very slow service.\"" \n\n\""Doesn't taste like a pancake.\""\n\n\""Even the coffee is awful.\""\n\n\""This sausage tastes like bologna.\""\n\nMy \""Test?\""\n\nSausage Gravy and Biscuits. Seems for a place named \""Biscuits,\"" this dish should be a trademark signature dish. Absolutely awful taste! Made with link sausage and the fellow \""breakfaster\"" was correct, when he said that the sausage tasted like bologna! The gravy was pasty and tasted like flour with no sausage taste at all. Not even a butter taste to it. Quite possibly the worst I have ever had! \n\nThe biscuits you ask? Awful as well, being thin and tasteless bordering on way too salty and equally inedible.\n\nIncidentally, when asked \""how was everything\"" I replied \""not good,\"" the Cashier didn't follow up to ask what was wrong, she just gave me my change and said \""thanks for coming in.\""\n\nThey will have to get lots better in order to make it. I won't try it again, but my prediction is they won't last."
1,"This is a cool place to go. My husband has a Harley Davidson and we love riding there. The ribs are good, the hush puppies and the burgers. We also like the appetizers. Check it out!"
0,"We had dinner there last night for my birthday. The waiter was not attentive at all. We were waiting for about 25 minutes before I finally flagged one down & asked him to wait on us. Then he stood behind me as I tried to ask him questions about the menu. I had to tell him I to come around because I couldn't twist anymore and I was uncomfortable.\nThroughout the meal, we had to keep looking for him. He never once came to the table to ask if we needed anything. \nI told him that we needed to split the bill bc we had a large party. He brings the bills and put someone else's food on my bill. I brought this to his attention so he could correct it & he brought me back the same bill. I just paid the bill bc I was tired of dealing with him. Probably some of the worst service I've had ever. \n\nAsides from that, everything was a bit overpriced. I know it's off the strip but nothing was so phenomenal that was worth the high prices. \n\nThe only thing that was good was the band."
0,"Came here to celebrate New Year's Eve, a birthday, and anniversary. I made reservations online and they greeted us happy birthday when we arrived. Asked for window seat which they happily moved us to. Food was average, waitress wasn't as friendly as I would hoped as I asked for recommendations and she didnt suggest what I read they were known for (lamb and wine). Came for the live jazz music but was disappointed as I overheard they would arrive later in the evening (we came at 7pm) and no music provided until the end of our meal when they played it through the speaker system. \n\nThe decor is really intimate but the food was average for the price. We had the seafood tagliatelle and steak and frites. \n\nMaybe I had high expectations since this was a three-in-one celebration dinner, but I don't think our first experience here deserved any higher than 2/5."
0,This seems like a mailed in effort from one of my favorite local chefs.  My breakfast sandwich was absolutely average and exceptionally messy given the fact that you are likely going to be eating it off your lap.  The bread was heavy and bland; I wound up discarding it.\n\n\nOne general complaint about the overall new restaurant plan.  I am absolutely a fan of the local restaurants in the airport but as I was in the Southwest terminal I couldn't find any reasonably priced dishes.  I find that interesting given the fact that the Southwest terminals are usually ground zero for families and young kids.  I feel bad for the mom of 4 who has no option but to spend $15 for some french toast at Barrio or LGO.  What happened to  the cheaper options?
1,All I can say is Perfect!  I come to Montreal for business from California......it is now a necessity that I dine at this restaurant each time i come here.  There is nothing I can complain about...... Barroco is just fabulous!
1,"I loved the decor. Jimmy Hendrix can hang over my bed any day. Cymbals line the hallway as reflectors for the lights. \n\nThe bed was incredibly comfortable, but beware! If you have allergies to down, like I do, the pillows, blanket, and mattress pad were all down. No wonder they were so comfortable! They were once meant to keep the ducks all cozy warm. Make sure you take your Zyrtec, or other allergy meds. \n\nThere were a number of pools, surrounded by little sand beaches. It was a different vibe then I've seen at other pools. Even though it was early afternoon on a Thursday, all the lounge chairs were taken, or supposedly reserved for future occupants, by their buddies. 'Oh, I'm saving these for someone.' The pool drinks are EXPENSIVE! A dollar an ounce for a pool drink! Between the two of us with 2 drinks and a tip, we spent 70 dollars!\n\nThe casino itself is shaped in a circle with the restaurants surrounding. I was surprised that this hotel, the Hard Rock being so popular, wasn't on the strip. What I really liked about it was that it didn't smell as smoky as the rest of the hotels and I returned home smelling less like an ashtray than I normally do on a trek to Vegas. \n\nI would definitely stay here again!"
0,"Holy poop, they are sooooo slow. They tell you it will take 20 minutes, and you're there for over an hour. The only chance you'll get fast service is if you're the only one there. They will also try to sell you extra crappy services you don't need (wait, everyone does this). However, they quoted me $70 (I knew I needed some extra crappy service), charged me $120, and then \""did me a favor\"" by taking 20 bucks off. $100 for an oil change and changing light bulbs. That's very effed of you, jiffy lube. I should have given you the new bulbs back and gone to an auto parts store to buy my own d*mn bulbs. ARGH."
0,"Bought a tape duplicator (Telex ACC 4000) on eBay and the tapes were coming out a bit \""worbly.\"" I took it in, put down a deposit, and they said I'd hear from them in a couple days. I didn't hear from them, so I just decided to go in, as I live close by. Firstly, the audio technician decided to tell me that the quality of the tapes I would make with the unit would be sub par. I know many tape labels that use this same unit, and told him so. Then he told me that the parts I needed may not be able to be found. I went into panic mode, as I desperately needed to get this in working order, and asked what kind of parts he was looking for. In an attempt to shrug me off, he was vague, and claimed I probably wouldn't be able to find them. \n\nI did.\n\nI called back and informed him of this, but said that if he could find the parts domestically (as what I found was in the UK), to let me know. I wait the weekend and call back to inquire, but as the phone is handed from the girl working the desk and the owner, I hear him say, \""Can we just give this back to him?\"" I was shocked at this kind of attitude towards a customer that was nothing but perhaps a little too persistant. After an unpleasant exchange, including a crack about my mental stability, I decided to pick it up.\n\nThe story gets crazier here.\n\nWhen I go in, I'm in a VERY poor mood. I ask for the tape duplicator, and ask why this was such and issue and why I had been  treated so poorly. I had been thinking it, but I decided to call him out on his incompetence. The unit did not include a plastic bag I had given it to them with, so I demanded one. This resulted in the man giving me a very threatening motion and insulting me. I repeated my demand, got the bag, exchanged insults, and left.\n\nThen I realize he didn't give me the power cable for the unit.\n\nI called back and demanded it, but his reply was to say that I forgot it, and that he wouldn't return it. I threatened police involvement, but was told that he had already contacted the police to file a harassment suit.\n\nI almost went in the store to confront them, but decided to be proactive and call the cops myself.\n\nNeedless to say, I got my power cable back. In exchange, they banned me from their store.\n\nI think I came out on top."
1,"Epic Painting = Epic Service\n\nAfter a hail storm thrashed the wood trim of my house, I was in the market for a painter.  The contractor that was doing my roof repairs did not offer painting services.  That contractor recommended that I contact Epic Painting, and I am really glad he did.\n\nUnlike many of the other painters I contacted, Josh from Epic Painting promptly returned my phone calls.  He worked closely with the insurance company adjustor regarding the repair work that needed to be done.  His crew was very professional and Josh always kept my informed on their progress.  We have a lot of landscaping around the house and none of it was damaged during the repair work.  \n\nI was so impressed with the repair work that Epic Painting did, I contracted with them to paint the trim that was not damaged by the hail.  It's been a year after the work has been completed and the house still looks great.  The quality of their work is really top notch.\n\nI enjoyed work with Josh and the Epic Painting team and strongly recommend them."
0,"Being a three dog Mom and fostering dogs on the side I often find myself in Petsmart just not generally this one.  I went in looking for two specific items, a Zoom Groom and a shed blade.  I asked Eric, the store manager, if they carried these items and because every store is set up a little differently where I could find them.  He was rude, short and abrasive.  Said they didn't carry anything called Zoom Groom and to check at Bed Bath and Beyond and anything else would be in the back.  He was an *ss but I figured check out what they had anyways since I was there.  \n\nIn the back I run into another employee, Ira, who offered his help and suggested even checking with the groomers to see what they suggested.  I did this and what do you know, about five different colored Zoom Grooms they sell and the store manager didn't even know it.  On my way out I made a comment to him that he should know his merchandise and he said he thought I said Zoom Broom.  Really!  Even if that's the case as a manager wouldn't you say something like, Do you mean the Zoom Groom or let me show you what we have?  I have been in plenty of Petsmarts and have done product demos in a variety of pet stores and fortunately Eric is not your typical employee as most go out of their way to help you.  But due to his lack of customer service skills this is one Petsmart I won't ever step foot in again."
0,The worst steak I have ever eaten. Applebees has better steak. This place was absolutely terrible. The prices are extremely ridiculous for what you get. Go out of business already.
1,"This place is addictive. When I'm on campus during the school year I go here literally at least once a week. Because of the lack of options that the good ol' U of I does NOT provide, Chipotle on Green St. is the place to go if you want good food and have nowhere else to go. The steak fajitas here never disappoint, and you're always in for a treat if any of the ingredients are freshly laid out (especially the meat!) However, I've noticed that the burritos here are somehow much smaller than the burritos I get when I'm home for the summer...hmmm...seems like another way U of I screws over its consumers and students. Nonetheless, this is a fabulous place to go if you've become addicted to Chipotle. But for $8 for a burrito and a small drink, it's hard to justify going here too often."
1,"This place is a palace!\n\nI love the arena.  The banners of championship teams, retired numbers, and even the Montreal Expos retired numbers are awe inspiring.  There is also a picture of a Canadiens great above every section.  I was lucky enough to be sitting in the Jacques LeMaire area (Go Devils!).\n\nThe game I came to see was vs the Sabres and it was a 2-0 loss.  I really wanted to experience a goal, but it was a great game.  I had gotten myself a Brian Gionta (ex-Devil) jersey and rooted for the home team.\n\nThe concourse was huge, packed to the gills during intermissions.  Luckily the bathrooms were also huge and clean.  With enough places to go, it moved quickly.  The Molson was good, and the concessions were plentiful.  The place is always sold out from what I understand, and it looked amazing.\n\nIt was easily found from my hotel and a fairly short walk.  Just get your tickets early, I got mine on Stubhub and paid double, which I heard wasn't too bad.\n\nI cannot wait to go back!  Hopefully I can see a game vs the Devils, before Brodeur retires."
1,"Came here while on a recent vacay in Vegas... Primarily came as I'm a big Bobby Flay fan. Overall enjoyed the food but have to say it wasn't as good as Mesa Grill. This place overall ranked as a nice fast food type of place. Similar to hook burger in LA. However that being said service was excels  and staff were friendly. The food was good but fries and onion rings didn't stand out from any other place I've had them. Ordered the grill cheese for myself which was perfect - crisp bread, gooey cheeses really well made. The wifey had a turkey burger but thought is was over cooked...would recommend if you're hankering for a quick bite but can't really say this one hit it out of the park."
0,"This was another restaurant that I really wanted to like. The wait for the table wasn't a big deal at all, it was a Friday night at 7 - needless to say, we knew what we were getting in to. But the hour wait after that to get food was awful...  especially when you are only getting a couple of tacos. Very tiny tacos at that. Then it took and another 30 min to get the check and pay our bill - no bueno Between our small party, we had duck, snapper, shrimp, steak, lamb and chicken tacos. All were 'meh', nothing to come back for. My friend said the lamb was good, but not something going out of his way for. The specialty drinks were equally unimpressive, and the very average house margarita was still ten bucks. Just for me, 3 tacos and 2 drinks was 37 bucks, for food that was tiny and nothing special to boot! \n\nThe design of the building was very cool, well done ambiance (but some really douchey people congregating at the bar who wouldn't move out of the isle as I am trying to walk by with my 4 month old sleeping baby.)\n\nThe tequila list looked impressive, but I am not going to spend $200 on a single shot of tequila. Again, everything was in place for a cool dining experience - then the food and service got in the way. (Although either the manager or owner who sat us was very kind and accommodating)"
0,"I went into Flame Kabob for the first time today. I ordered the Beef Shish Kabob and a soda, it was $12 for the two. That right there was a bit too steep for lunch in my opinion so I hoped the meal would make up for that price. To my disappointment, it took FOREVER to get my food! I wasted half of my hour lunch just on ordering and waiting for the food to be done (note: I work next door practically!). The meat wasn't cooked throughout and the rice was just meh. The only thing that saved the meal was the freshly prepared taffoon bread. That was delish. So that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just one.\n\nAll things considered...I will definitely not return to this restaurant. It was worth a shot but I rather take my $12 somewhere else."
1,"Oh Goddamn. This place is the best place in Vegas for breakfast. Do you like alcohol? Check. Do you like good food? Check. Do you want to try the beautiful invention that is mash browns? Check. Do you like freedom? Gottdamn muthafuckin check. \n\nI can't even say how amazing the food is, but the bottomless mimosas flowing keep everything moving in the right direction. Sherolyn kept us going and was an awesome person. Tip your waitress 30%."
0,"Meh... Average pizza to me. Ordered a slice of cheese, and nothing special could have went to sbarros for the same thing. Can't say anything about the other food items but I would expect the same quality. \n\nStaff was somewhat welcoming, after our order was completed they all huddled to the back and conversed amongst each other. Gentleman who served me warned me that the pizza was hot, but it was barely warm. \n\nDrink prices are outrageous for the sizes, and the tea machine didn't even function. Just poured water out. Also, there are no prices posted of anything, besides the drinks.  \n\nAll in all, the likely hood of me eating here would be either it's the only place open at the time, someone else is buying, or I'm drunk and any pizza sounds good."
0,CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS A LOT OF HELP!!!!\n\nCustomer service is a nightmare and Managers need to focus on there performance. I am not a complainer but when your online orders consistanly are wrong and when told to call an order in from now on and then they constatnly hang up on you then you are forced to find another place to eat. \n\nFood is great but they have to seriously work on customer service!! \n\nCafe Rio has lost our loyalty!
0,This was our big dinner after the big race and our pre-party. \n\nWe came here exhausted and hungry. And we were all craving for meat.

0,Good service & cold beer. I would recommend drinking here and eating elsewhere.
1,"Really cool atmosphere. I had the watermelon rose cocktail, which was awesome!, and the albacore tataki. The appetizer had a bit too much dressing, but the concept and presentation, and the taste, was great! Definitely a cool place to grab a drink or a meal after shopping."
1,Good service and yummy French food! I had the Gazpacho and the vegetable crepes and they were both delicious.
0,"This place isn't what it's cracked up to be. We were downtown and decided to go. We heard from some friends that this place was really good. They said they have the best carne asada but it's actually just mediocre. \n\nIf you want really good Mexican food you should try out Los Taquitos, they have the best Mexican food in the valley. They were also featured on diners drive-ins and dives, so that gives them a little bit of cred."
1,"Best burgers. Nothing more to say.\n \n\nAlright, I will say it again - Best burgers."

1,"Great Bar with your usual upgraded bar food.  The food is not 5 star cuisine expertly prepared by a chef that has a manicure and a show on Food Network, but it is actually not that bad.

You do not really go for the food.  \n\nThat would be like visiting Hooters for the wings.\nThat would be like going to church to pick up chicks.\nThat would be like going to a funeral to pick up chicks.\nThat would be like admitting yourself in the hospital for the free tongue depressers.\nThat would be like drinking whiskey out of a wine glass (you just look stupid).\nThat would be like going early to a Stones concert and Michael Bolton is the opening act.\nThat would be like going to a library to practice drums.\nThat would be like going to a petting zoo on the first date.\nThat would be like bringing your laptop on a 3 hour cruise.\nThat would be like shaving your body in the winter.\nThat would be like getting married when she isn't even mad at you.\nThat would be like curtain shopping at Bed Bath and Beyond and expecting it not to suck.\nThat would be like going to Amsterdam and having a job interview with drug test the day after you come home.\n\n....don't expect the food to be mind-blowing, just enjoy the bar atmosphere for what it is."
1,Best indian lunch buffet in town!!! You will not be disappointed.
0,"The food here is beyond terrible and overpriced.  I honestly don't see how people are actually giving this place decent ratings.  The staff brings EVERTHING and that included the to go boxes out on a bus cart.  The salad (if you can even call it that) had no green in it whatsoever.  It consisted of only the inside pieces of iceburg lettuce mixed with what I think might be trying to pass as ham.  All though my dinner companion theorized that it may be catagorized as spam or bologna.  The pizza was covered in burnt cheeze and the crust was undercooked.  It was so tough you couldn't bite into it, instead it had to be cut with a steak knife.  Their Italian beef sandwich was cold and the meat was completely dry.  The fact that we were there at what should be peak dining hours on a Saturday evening and the place was totally empty should speak for itself on the popularity of this place.  I honestly can't say that I've ever had worse Italian food ever in my life.  \n\nIf you want good Chicago style pizza drive a few more minutes east to Old Chicago Pizza.  At least there you won't have to worry about an upset stomach the next day."
1,"Nice alternative from most Vegas attractions and a good way to kill the afternoon if you're not hungover. Not appropriate for all ages, obviously. Definitely gruesome in some parts. The Valentine's Day Massacre display was pretty intense. Museum itself seemed like new."
1,"I've been to the Grand Cafe a few times. Every time I'm staying at the Palace Station, I have to stop by the cafe. They have great specials! If you're a boarding pass member, you even get more for your money. I came here with some friends and Brian was our server. He was patient with us and super attentive. He was friendly and awesome to converse with. He's also really cute! I ordered the open faced turkey and it was amazing. Everyone else in the group was satisfied with their meal. We had a pleasant dining experience and left a generous tip for our server. Definitely give this place a try."
1,"Always a good bet to come here if you're in the mood for reasonably priced Thai or Chinese food. Everything in the menu is delicious. I really recommend the 'beef jerky'. The place is consistently busy, which is always good sign."
1,"I had no idea that there was a Green Restaurant so close to me!  I must say that I prefer the location in Phoenix as far as decor even tho this is the original.  I took my meat eating friend and he loved his special.  As usual the food was great, but I decided to try something different this time and got a Chai Tiramisu Tsoynami.  Note: As I was warned by the server, it tastes nothing like Tiramisu (which is my favorite dessert), but I got it anyway.  It was interesting....it had crushed animal crackers and a taste of ginger.  It was fine but I wouldn't get it again."
1,"Amazing service. Really. I've never heard of this burger chain, but hadn't eaten in 12 hours and 12 states. I just wanted a burger. The menu was a befuddlement of strange ways to make a burger. I picked a Cali burger but without the house sauce (careful due to egg allergy). It tasted weird, really...weird. The tomato was a glop (fire roasted apparently) and the onions were more like egg noodles - wet cooked strings. \nI scraped it off and tried again but it still tasted weird. Megan, my attentive waitress, asked if everything was good. I expressed my opinion. Although I didn't like it I didn't blame the restaurant. Sometimes things just aren't to your taste. However my  surprise and delight the manager immediately swooped in, organized for me as close to a \""regular\"" burger as they were able to construct - which was basically burger, bun, lettuce, raw onions. The manager also brought over a selection of sauces on the side. She asked if I like mustard. I said don't even go there I only like colemans. 3 minutes later she showed up with a side dish of English mustard! The new burger was much more to my liking.\n\nSo there you go - it's not my kind of restaurant - but that's no-ones fault. This place went above and beyond to make it as right as they possibly could. Epically amazing service."
0,I don't think I will be staying at the MGM again. They always mess up my reservation and when they messed up my reservation for my bachelorette party that was the last straw! We booked a queen suite attached to a regular queen room and the paranoid person I am...I called multiple times to confirm this because I had 10 girls and we all wanted to be together. I arrive Friday at 9 AM only to find out that there are no more queen suites available...I was SO UPSET. They told me that it was first come first serve...WTF I RESERVED 2 ROOMS AND WAS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT I WANTED AND PAID FOR IT! After a hour of waiting they finally came up with something: a king suite attached to a queen room -_- We took it because we had no choice and some of the girls slept on the couch and a couple on the floor...to make things worse they didn't even give us a cheaper rate! SO LAME. \n\nMGM will definitely not be my first choice in the future...this experience made me not want to come back!
1,"A sexy little bar that's perfect for snuggling and getting cozy! Since it is situated right in the middle of the casino, you get a pretty good view of everyone gambling and misbehaving. Service is excellent, prices are high (big surprise!), and the chairs are so comfy."
0,"This review is for the Easter Brunch/Dinner. We went here for Thanksgiving and our experience was 5 stars. From the food to the service, everything was on point. However, Easter was a whole new game. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation time, but we weren't seated until 45 minutes after our reservation time. During our wait with a room full of other eager people with reservations, the girl seating the tables, accepts money from a gentleman to be seated earlier. That was just not cool. You want to push a customers reservation to keep people happy, I understand, but accepting money when there is a room FULL of people is unacceptable. The food was average. Maybe my expectations were high after our Thanksgiving experience, but I was disappointed. I don't think we will be back for the Easter Brunch in the future."
1,"I haven't been to the Tornado Club in about 5 years but this was always the special occasion restaurant we frequented in college.  All of the steaks are excellent and well cooked.  They got some good beef in the midwest ya know.  This is the first place I tried venison and its been the best tasting and least gamey I've had anywhere.  The best dish on the menu here is the coquille st jacques (sp?).  The mashed potatoes, the scallops and the sauce are perfectly married and served elegantly on a cleaned out shell.  Its the perfect dish and many of my friends have ordered 2 - one as appetizer and another for main dish.  If you're a fan of frog legs and escargot you'll be happy to know these dishes also shine.  I guess anything with a lot of butter and garlic is bound to be good but these are especially lovely.  \n\nThe last time I was ever there during graduation weekend a bat, yes a bat, started flying around the restaurant.  It got through an open window in our dining room.  You've never seen so many 21 year old guys jump underneath a table so quickly.  Anyway we eventually shooed the bat out the same window.  For our inconvenience we got free liquor and free desserts.  Not a bad deal for some starving hungry college kids."
0,"Sorry in advance for the ridiculously long post...\nIm not sure where to start... the mediocre food or the mediocre service. We stopped by on a Sunday night with a reasonably large group (10). Since we wanted to see the Bellagio Show before is ends at 12AM we stopped by Hash House to check on the wait. We were told there was no wait and in fact they were slow. We asked to put our name down for a reservation and were told they dont take reservations (ok). We cam back round 11 and were promptly told it would be 20-25 minutes. We were not please but decided to wait because we where here and staying close by and all wanted toi tyr the food. After a 10 minute wait the greater came and told us it was going to be at least another 25 minutes because they only had one large table available and that table just received their food. Annoying, I should have taken this as a sign, but the majority of the group was fine although a little annoyed. One friend decided to walk around and saw that they were in fact very slow (almost no tables occupied) and also had a back room with a large table available. He asked the receptionist if they could put tables together since almost the whole restaurant was empty or let us sit in the back. All we receive was a \""no, we cant do that\"". Cant or Wont? Still we waited on. 15 more minutes pass and surprise they open the table in the back section. So I guess they could do it. Finally we are all sitting down starving and ready to go in on some delicious food... Or were we. We placed our orders based on their \""late night menu\"", which is lack luster at best (about 10 items). The waiter came round and although he was polite seems a little slow based on how unbusy they were. Heres were it went south quickly. I ordered the Sage Chicken Benedict and asked for the eggs poached, cause who the hell scrambles eggs and calls it eggs Benedict?! The wait for the food again seemed long for how slow the place was, 20 minutes, but for good food I would gladly wait. First thing I noticed when they bring my food is eggs are not poached. I ask the waiter to fix it and he graciously takes my plate back. 10-15 minutes pass my whole party is eating (although one guy got his food alarmingly later then everyone else). The waiter brings back my plate and it looks disheveled and clearly reconstructed. I look at it and touch it to see if they remade the plate or just switched out the eggs. The waiter quickly snaps at me \""I had them remake the whole plate\"" to which I reply \""I highly doubt that, because its not hot.\"" The icing on the cake and what made it so blatant that the food was not remade was my poached eggs were not even on the dish... they came on the side in a sad lonely little bowl. They remade the whole plate... really? There was no apology no admission he just carried on as usual. We received the check (tip already included because of the size of our group) and he went on about his business with out offering anything to compensate for the poor service and blatant lie. His name was David BTW, I was so pissed off I made sure to look it up so I could mention him, by name, in this review. The final nail in the Hash House coffin, the food aint that good. Its OK at best. Its over sized and over sauced and the taste is underwhelming. Its like they put extra portions of mediocre food on a plate cover it on bacon, mashed potatoes and sauce and call it spectacular. I know good food and this is no where close. Not a single person at the table seemed to be impressed, only one person even took left overs. The most impressive thing about the food at this restaurant other then the portion size was the huge branch of sage sticking out of their plate. That was pretty awe inspiring. Total restaurant fail."
1,"As far as I'm concerned, Flo's Chinese Restaurant can expand their mini dynasty into MY neighborhood!\n\nI'd heard largely good things about Flo's and decided to take it in, myself.  Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall, but a quaint one at that.  The interior is sorta (sub)urban-chic.  It's a mix of upscale and low-brow with linen table cloths and throwaway paper napkins.  Cool enough for adults, yet casual enough if you're bringing the kids.  I was fortunate in that unlike some other Yelpers, I had no trouble finding a parking spot and the decibel level was comfortable.\n\nThe hostess was smiley and seated me right away.  The server and busboy (or is that bus man???) were quick to have ice water, crispy won tons with duck sauce and a complimentary side salad (iceburg, romaine, carrot slivers) on the table within seconds.  It's evident they are aware the lunch crowd may not have time for a long wait.  I didn't go crazy, sticking to a couple of \""safe\"" options ordering the orange chicken with steamed white rice and the Triple Chocolate Mousse.  The dessert was pretty, but just OK for flavor and texture.  However, I have to say the chicken was fantastic; moist without too much batter!  I've had orange chicken at many other restaurants before and have been served lumps of fried dough with an indiscernible amount of actual chicken.  Not the case at Flo's!\n\nThe portions were good and the prices very reasonable: just $7 for the lunchtime entree!  Next time I'll take advantage of the $5 special on a Saturday!"
0,DO NOT COME HERE. This was the WORST food I've EVER had in Vegas and I've lived here for 19 years. I literally almost vomited and requested a refund through Eat24 because I sure as hell wasn't going back there!
1,Great salon prices are black and white and they don't try to bribe you into other things! Very friendly
1,"A steakhouse is a steakhouse is a steakhouse.\n\nA Las Vegas Strip steakhouse is a great steakhouse is an expensive steakhouse. \n\nYes, the beef was very fine. The doneness was spot on. The mushrooms were delish. The cocktails were perfect. The bill was exorbitant. Yadda yadda yadda. That can be said for just about any steakhouse on the Strip (and I've been to several).\n\nWhat sets the Old Homestead Steakhouse apart and will make us repeat diners is the wonderful service we received that made our evening.\n\nWe stopped by here after being told there was an hour-and-a-half long wait at Mesa Grill. The hostess remembered us from the night before (we had tried to stop for a nightcap the previous night, but were told by the assistant manager that they were closed). She said there were cancellations and she could seat us immediately. Nice. We were shown to a table, brought bread and water right away, and told that our server would be Kevin. \n\nKevin turned out to be one of those industry pros, he'd been a server with the Caesar's restaurant for 30-some years. We took to him immediately as he matched our mood and temperament, and was happy to chat with us and give us the time and interaction we were looking for, even though he had at least two other large parties he was taking care of. The smallest of gestures caught his eye. He anticipated our needs. He was there with a hot finger towels after I was done gnawing on the bone of our NY steak. \n\nA quick note on the steaks - they had some interesting bone-in cuts you don't usually find at other steakhouses. The bone-in filet is on my bucket list.\n\nThe assistant manager came by at one point to apologize again for having to turn us away last night and thank us for coming back and giving the restaurant another change. \n\nWe had to commend Kevin to the manager, Perry, who was very gracious and gave us his number for future reservations. Kevin said he'd make sure we got a better table next time too, although I didn't think there was anything wrong with the table we had. We didn't have dessert, as nothing in particular appealed to me and dinner was quite satisfying already. So we finished with port and scotch instead and I had the hankering for a bit of chocolate to go with my scotch. Kevin came to the rescue again, bringing me some dark chocolate curls that hit the spot. \n\nThe Old Homestead treated us like regulars even though it was only our first time there. I think there is something to be said for a steakhouse or any restaurant that can make you feel that way on a first visit :)"
1,I could not have asked for better service. Alex was very polite and helpful on the phone.The food from UPs restaurant was excellent and was delivered right on time by a very polite and friendly deliveryman. I would highly recommend Happy Bellies and look forward to using them in the future.\n\nNancy D.B.
1,"After going through 2 other exterminators, I was at my wit's end. I had found 20+ scorpions in my house. I was stung in bed and both my dogs were stung on other occasions. A friend referred me to Responsible Pest Control. They took the time to answer all of my questions over the phone. I booked my appointment and they came out within a timely manner. The technician was amazing, friendly, knowledgeable, and thorough. After treatment, I found about 10 dead scorpions. Luckily, my house lease was over shortly after that and I definitely moved! The only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the contract that must be signed unless you want to spend quite a bit more money."
1,"this review is gonna be all over the place cuz there's a restaurant, a club, and a lounge. the best thing about this place is the restaurant! too bad i was not more hungry so i could finish that fuckn meatball. that damn thing was the size of my head! i shared it with lobster bisque and veggie sides. everything was sooo good! some of the best i've had in vegas. all very rich tho (butter! cream! olive oil!) so very filling. it's best to wear a bubble dress :P just get wine with the food, there's no alcohol in their cocktails. shit is like kool-aid. they even come in a kool-aid pitcher if u want a pitcher. the service was awesome. we had like 10 waiters come up to us. apparently they all were clamoring to get us plates and water. we pretty much got asked twice for everything...ha ha. they were all good looking and fun so it was cool ;)\n\nclub is 2 stars. it looked too crowded on the main floor and the music was just regular cheesy dance music. u know, like miley cyrus. \n\nwe were gonna bounce but the first floor lounge had some bad ass hip hop. so i had to stay for just one song....and then ooooh one more! and then i ended up just staying period. only a handful of people were dancing here & thre but i dint give a fuck! music made me wanna *move*. wish people were groovin to it too tho..."
1,"Although I won't be given a 5 star review, I would easily say that the Cornish Pasty in it's own special way fits in my top 3 restaurants I've been too in Phoenix.\n\nI had never tasted pasties before until meeting my girlfriend and had doubts as to the potential quality of \""British\"" food but I was truly blown away and have always left happy and never dissatisfied with my meal. It's hard to not stick to your favorites (the pesto chicken) I've personally also enjoyed the Shepherd's pie and chicken Alfredo as well. They also have a decent list of import beers which caps off the experience.\n\nMeal aside though, in terms of the complete experience, meal, atmosphere, waiters,etc, that is were it loses it's one star. First off the location isn't very big...and they only have one location (this is a positive...but at the same time, just like Pita Jungle, with it's many locations and consistent quality, I would love to see another one arrive and I know this is the case soon). Secondly, and it's nearly impossible to avoid due to the size of the restaurant and the proximity to the kitchen, the place can get a bit hot and stuffy. But otherwise, whether a resident or a visitor wanting to try a \""recommended\"" place, I would put my money on Cornish Pasty for a very delicious and filling meal."
1,Why do I like this place? Because it just doesn't feel like Las Vegas! \nThis place has an amazing vibe to it and the bartenders are really good. There are no slot machines here...just some great food and drink...it allows me to escape from Vegas and it takes me to a tropical place in my mind. \n\nDinner is great here...do not pass up the Cheese Burger in Paradise...it is one of the best burgers you will find...plus I highly recommend the Ultimate Margarita. We also sit at the bar and enjoy talking to the bartenders. They are fun bunch up there and make the night enjoyable. \n\nRecently they added breakfast here and I was able to swing buy and grab a bite before work. I sat at the bar on the second floor and the bartenders that worked up there were fantastic. I had an amazing 3 egg white omelet is so nice not to eat at an all you can eat buffet in Vegas. The cooked to order breakfast was really good. I was amazed to see other people at the bar drinking Margarita's at 9am...I guess that is how you start your day in the desert of sin city...my liver was hurting for them.
1,Love this place!  Great service and good quality work. Drive from east mesa to get my nails done here :-)
0,"What was I thinking to step foot in this dump? I had family in from out of town that wanted t-shirts to take home to Nebraska. Bonanza has t-shirts, really good ones if you like lame knockoffs and hoochie mama type shirts but nothing you'll want to be seen in outside of Fremont St. much less wearing it in Lincoln, NE.\n\nIf you want 25 different Las Vegas themed shot glasses, CSI knockoffs, used decks of cards from Harrah's, and 6 different colors of dice you'll find it here. You'll also find overly aggressive security who treats everyone as thieves in waiting, and a checkout process that is a bit archaic. Oh and there's somebody at the door to check your receipt like that's going to keep someone from stealing something? And the staff has to be one of the most sourpussed group of unfortunate souls collecting a check in the city. \n\nAfter stopping here I kinda wish that all the demolition on the North end of the Strip, ie: The Frontier and such had been done a little bit further North. Perhaps once the SLS Las Vegas revives the Sahara some developer will come in and remove this crappy place. While I'm all for preserving Old Vegas, pictures of this dump will suffice vs. keeping the real thing. \n\nThis review is for the Gift Shop only and not the liquor store. Which might be about the only redeeming quality for this place."
0,"Gross! I ordered a turkey sandwich. Just awful. The bread was falling apart and hard, the meat tasted terrible, like plain ol' lunch meat. Overpriced and definitely not worth it. Don't waste your time or money!"
0,"Honestly you're probably a hotel guest if you're staying here and you got a free voucher or whatever for the buffet. \n\nBased on the free experience it's decent. I came at 1145 on a weekday and they were sadly getting rid of the breakfast stuff already which is the hardest thing to mess up. \n\nUnfortunately, replacing eggs, bacon, pancakes, and potatoes was a BAKED POTATO BAR. And I don't know about you but who gives a shit about baked potatoes. They have tons of toppings, but then again you don't go to a buffet to get a giant baked potato.\n\nAs for the \""regional BBQ\""... I have no idea lol I only tried the pulled pork and it was meh. \n\nA lot of random, mediocre items throughout the buffet. \nBut again, if it comes with the hotel it's decent. Otherwise I would for sure never pay to eat here. \n\nService was outstanding."
0,"I spied a 75% off rack at Amy, Inc. I decided I should go and look. I found some wonderful clothes. The girl ringed me up and as I looked at the receipt the accounting looked wrong it was for $155, however I had figured roughly about $120 max. So I reviewed the receipt and I explained to the girl that two of my shirts don't show the correct amount on the receipt. She then just tried to explain it away 3 times to me, but it still didn't make sense. \""Ok, I asked do you mind just re-ringing it up because you see it doesn't make sense and I am trying to understand\""? \""Sure, let me go get the owner\"". \n\n The owner looked put out and annoyed. Why did she have to bother with me and with this little order? She looked at me up and down and said to the girl \""we do it this way to save the customer a few cents, but we will re-ring it all\"".  I thought wow, turning dollars into cents interesting and I ask \""this isn't going to hit my account twice, is it\""? \""No, she said anything that gets voided before mid-night it won't go against your account\"". So she re-rang the clothes and the amount came to $95. Cool, I thought pleasantly surprised. I smiled at her and chuckled \""that was a little more than just a few cents\"". She looked at me like I was something out of the movie Pretty Woman when the character Julia who is a prostitute tries to spend her money at an expensive store and gets refused. So I am uncomfortably looking down at this point and then I hear \""NO! Don't do that we will never see the money\"". I looked up at her and told her I am standing right here and I would think from an establishment such as this one that I would be treated with more respect. She started interrupting me loudly telling me that her customers are generally more patient and that she told her girl that because she was going to override the system and process the transaction. So I said \""well you either way you can imagine what that sounds like to me\""? \""I say...there is plenty of money in my account, can you try again\""?  \""She says we did, if you have so much money in the bank I can call them for you\""! I finally replied \""I can easily go and get you cash, but I would never spend my money here, keep the clothes\"" She replies \""I don't have time for this\"" and walks away and so did we.\n\nWe found out the hard way our account had been hit 3 times once for $155 and twice for $95 so our bank put a hold on our account all weekend long for those amounts and because of the multiple transactions they thought it was fraud so we had to get our account off of lock down. At the same time all that money was going to be held until Amy, Inc. cleared it up on their end. \n\nTuesday I get a call from my husband, in which he informed me that they actually charged us $155 to our account! For clothing I never left the store with! So I called them dealt with the same two people (the employee and the owner) and explained what happened and asked them to credit our account, no apologies or nothing just a disclaimer that she didn't know how long it would take until I got my money back. (Ended up taking 5 more days).\n\nMoral of the story never shop at Amy, Inc. in Scottsdale."
0,"Service in the dining room is just bad, especially for a restaurant of this supposed quality. Food is mediocre at best. As a local familiar with many of the fine restaurants in Vegas, I know I won't return.\n\nDon't go there. There are many other great alternatives, such as Vic & Anthony's in the Golden Nugget, Del Frisco's on Paradise Ave., (both are 2 of the best in the city), Brand in the Monte Carlo, Strip House in Planet Hollywood, Botero at Encore/Wynn. You'll get much more for your money at all of these and many others."
1,This is a nice concept. Bring your own bottle. We stopped by SAO and got us a bottle of a Saint emilion red wine. It was very good. The service was good as we were seated immediately. We started out with the lamb carpaccio. I think you have to acquire the taste. Then we had main course -veal chop. It was tasty. The dessert was chcocalate something. See photo
0,"Recently, when we've shopped at JSM, we've had the unfortunate experience of returning home, excited to use/or are in the midst of using a product, whereupon we notice one of the following: 1. Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \n\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \n\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \n\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. \n\nDeli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker \""clean\"" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \n\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \n\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a \""freegan\"" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small \""mom & pop\"" businesses, but I have standards & limits. JSM has surpassed both. It's unfortunate since we like the place, or rather, we want to like it, but there are just too many problems."
1,I am surprised that the newly revamped show is pretty awesome!   the new giant eruption plus the drum synced fire makes this one of the better free shows/attractions on the strip for me!
1,"Lustige Kneipe und Restaurant in der N\u00e4he vom Euro.\n\nGanz nett, um mal mit Freunden ein Bier und/\u00f6der K\u00f6lsch zu zischen. Das Publikum ist bunt gemischt und hier sollte eigentlich jeder auf seine Kosten kommen.\n\nIm Sommer bewirtschaftet das Dom das Sommercaf\u00e9 an der Karlsburg in Durlach."
1,"I tried Boardhouse for the first time today due to fantastic reviews on yelp and...they were right!!! This place has delicious sammiches! I had the Charlie Tuna, and while it was quite tasty it didn't have the mango chutney on it (hence the 4 stars). That was a little disappointing as that is the whole reason I got the sandwich...but alas, mangoes probably aren't in season right now. My co-worker got the Chicken Bruschetta and said it was basically life-changing (okay, so he didn't REALLY say that...but he acted like it). I got the coleslaw too and that was a little on the bland side, not bad per se, but not full of flavor. All in all I would say this place is fantastic and a definite must to try (I patronized the Boardhouse located on Craig in North Las Vegas)...you won't be disappointed.\n\nUPDATE (25 AUG): Got the Charlie Tuna again...this time it had the mango chutney and it was AWESOME!! Definitely a perfect flavor to off set the saltiness of the tuna...unfortunately the bread was different this time. It was on whole wheat loaf bread, as opposed to the hoagie type wheat bread (which was WAY better btw)...either way - a MUST try! OH, and lest I forget, they have a rewards card that allows you to earn \""cash\"" towards sandwiches every time you order!!\n\nOH - so I finally figured out that when you get the short board combo for the tuna it comes on the sub roll, not when you order just the sandwich. Also, if you ARE getting the short board combo you have to ASK for the mango chutney (50 cent charge)."
1,"Good...with some caveats. \nFood can be outstanding... service at times uneven... a very nice looking restaurant.\nJust watch out for certain dishes, they can be exceptionally rich, ie- the beef stroganoff (this coming from someone that normally has a cast-iron stomach).\nAnd ordering wines by the glass gets you a very small pour... question the amount, and you receive a rote reply... \""it's an automated measure,\"" so nothing can be done.\nHey.. BS is still BS, and a light pour gets the house numerous additional $10 charges from the same bottle.\nWill visit again.. just be more aware of ingredients & their preparation.. and order vino by the bottle only."
1,"Mark Rich's NY Pizza IMHO is rated way too low. I know, haters are going to hate no matter what, but dang people if you're going to hate make it for the right reasons. \n\nMy wife, 2 year old and I checked this place out last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Ok, being a pizza snob it's not Settebello. But sometimes you want a pizza without fuss that you can customize and with a thin crust. And that's what I got, a pizza with a reasonably thin, hand tossed crust. I watched the guy toss it and he's good at it. And when you add fresh veggies and tomatoes and more it's not going to be as dry as a cracker, it's going to be kind of wet. (Notice I said wet, not soggy, there's a vast difference there!)  I ordered a NY Combination, tossed the bell pepper, added green olives and tomatoes. What I got tasted great. The green olives added just the right amount of saltiness so it was like a combination meets a Mediterranean pizza. It was good. But I wasn't the only one liking it as my 2 year old didn't spit it out and he ate very good here. (This is also one place where I even ate the crust as it was really good)\n\nMy wife ordered manicottis which I tried and liked but had to stay away from as I had that massive pizza to enjoy. Our appetizer included mushrooms, zucchini, and mozzarella sticks. The zucchini was off for me but my wife loved it, and the mushrooms and mozzarella sticks were quickly gone.  \n\nService was really good. I did have one time I had to ask for an ice tea refill but that was it. Service with a smile? Yep, got it here in abundance. Oh and one other little detail, the fork I was using had seen better days. But beyond that, I have nothing else I can gripe about. \n\nOverall, I liked this place. And I will be back. While Old School Pizzeria, Grimaldi's, and Settebello have their place, Mark Rich's NY Pizza is worth a look too."
0,"It's weird that they would not serve my girl friend and I after the Dbacks game at the bar. My friend who I was with is 6'1 and I'm 5'0 and I had to jump over the bar stool to get into my seat because of the crowded bar, and 5 minutes later the manager said they could not serve us because \""we were falling over the chairs\"" clearly we were not. There was no slurring of words nothing, they didn't even start a conversation with us to see how our speech was. But obviously the management haven't taken their liquor cert. title 4 to look for things in an \""intoxicated person\"" thank god we didn't spend our money on this establishment."
1,"Amazingly delicious veggie cheesesteak sandwich.  Shared a $12.75 20\"" sandwich and we were both full.  Comes with cheese, peppers, and onions, if you want mushrooms, there is an extra charge.\n\nI deducted one star because they need a better restroom situation."
0,"I wanted to eat here because I have always heard the Rio had a great buffet...\n\nI wish I had not wasted my time. \n\nI waited in line for about an hour just to pay, then another 10 minutes to be seated. \n\nThey provided no way to crack the crab and I ended up hurting my fingers. The rest of the food tasted pretty much like cafeteria food. For 40 bucks a person, I feel is was entirely not worth it. Plus the Rio is really run down looking so I didn't even enjoy hanging around after eating."
1,Yay I am fan too!  I saw this place open recently and knew I would get in to try it eventually.  Well last week was my chance... I actually came twice last week that is how much I liked it.  The owners are extremely nice and attentive and the sandwiches are spectacular!  I have to say I am a condiment hater... manly just one kind of condiment mayonnaise or any variation of that:)  What I loved about this place is they have a tuna salad with no mayo!! it is awesome!  they also add capers to the tuna salad which add such a great flavor.  I had them add some pesto and olive tapenade to my sandwich... it was sooo good I basically had to force myself to stop eating it.  I will definitely be back... cant wait to try a different sandwich and some crepe's too!
1,"This is one of the best shows in las vegas due to how different it is. Compared to the other Cirque du Soleil shows in Las Vegas, Ka is the most visually stunning. While I appreciated the other shows like O and Zumanity for its physcial stunts of the performers, Ka takes it to another level with its moving stage. I sat in the fouth row center, but as some of the performances are in the air and on the side of the theater, it may be better to sit further back, so that you can see the actors easily."
1,"It pains me to take away one star from this place, because I loved it so much the first 4 or 5 times. But this last visit was the reason.\n\nThe lady who works there was ALWAYS friendly to me. In fact, I remember her being warm and jovial. However, the last time we went, it was like she did a 180 and was a totally different person. She was curt, short, awkward, and borderline rude. In fact, I totally agree with Steven P's review of how she acted. \n\nIf it wasn't for the first few times, I would probably also give a lower rating, perhaps 2 stars, based on this last interaction. But with my past experiences, and the fact that I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, I took away only one star with the intention to go back again. However, if service was anything like the last time, I would probably pick another spot in Chinatown to eat from now on.\n\nTo be continued..."
1,"I had a good experience flying Frontier. I bought a last minute, one-way Frontier ticket because of the decent fare. After buying it, I read the many negative online reviews, so decided to build in extra time at Sky Harbor before my flight and lowered my expectations (and paid close attention to the number and size of my carry-on and personal bags- made sure I had room to fit my purse inside my suitcase so I could stowe my carry-on with books and computer at my feet.)  I ended up having 2 great, on-time flights, an easy connection, comfortable seats and an all-round satisfactory experience.  I fly often and like it when expectations and the experience are in sync."
0,I use to love the place. However the past few times I've been the sushi just hasn't been normal quality or flavor. They do have a good happy hour. Cool place to stop and grab a drink with and enjoy the atmosphere. I hope they get better.
0,I love my starbucks! this place was about 40% more than your typical non tourist area.\n\nThe lady messed up my cinnamon dolce latte to a vanilla latte! She also messed up on a tall medium blend coffee with a shot of expresso. Come on! its pass 7am and I dont need this. Plus 6 people behind me didnt need this either.\n\nmy cinnamon dolce was water down.It didnt taste heavy like it should. \n\nBut overall I wont be back to MGM and that means I wont be back at this starbucks!
1,"Came here for the $10 AYCE sushi event for Sushimon's 10 year anniversary and it was awesome.  The fish was good and they were ultra-fast!  We ordered 4 orders of 6 types of nigiri and it was sitting on our table in 5 minutes tops.  I really enjoyed the garlic tuna nigiri and the cajun albacore nigiri and make it one of my frequent orders that day.  Didn't want to order any rolls because I was more focused on hitting up the nigiri and making sure to get my monthly nigiri fix.  My buddy ordered 5-6 orders of uni sushi (usually one order per person at other sushi spots) as well and got it just as fast as I did!  The food was pretty fresh and my group and I left super full from definitely stuffing ourselves with all the yummyness we could.\n\nOn a side note, we had to wait for 4 hours, but with the AYCE price this low and one hour of AYCE madness, I wasn't suprised or mad BECAUSE IT'S $10 DOLLARS!!  Just because some people don't have patience and/or didn't make an effort to come down earlier does NOT mean that Sushimon deserves a 1-star for not catering to you.  They took the price cut to give the public a nice treat and were simply overwhelmed with the response.  Yet, they turned up the production to 11 and kept the event going as best as they could.  No one was entitled to the $10 AYCE price and I definitely didn't feel like I was.  I came in as soon as possible, waited my turn, and got to enjoy the event as intended.\n\nI give them 5 stars for dropping their price low, good foods, and giving us the best service they could while dealing with snooty ungrateful people.  Definitely stopping by again; Sushimon has made a customer out of me."
0,Ok.  But from slow for a place that you order the counter.  Even with just a few people the service at the counter was slow.  And then another wait.  I couldn't help and notice that some people didn't like their food.   Frankly I expected more from the Bellagio.
0,"Odd. I thought this place was pretty well respected for its BBQ fare. \n\nRibs were overcooked. Fall off the bone is nice, but not fall to pieces and get delivered in a pile of mixed bone and meat. Sauce was old. No smoke flavor. At all. \n\nBrisket was the same. Moosh. Nasty coagulated fat. No smoke ring, no smoke. Dry. Food service grade meat per the coarse grain with the marble cooked out of it. \n\nFried okra; moosh. Tasteless. \n\nMac and cheese was tasty, but swimming b\u00e9chamel. \n\nBest thing I had was.......the Texas toast. \n\nVisited at 7:15 pm on a Thursday. Pretty empty. \n\nMaybe the other location(s) are up to speed but this visit reeked of par cooked nasty."
0,"completely appalled, i went to the salon for a cut and i  cut about 16 inches my hair, the stylist that i had,her name was (haley) asked me if i would like to donate to locks of love i told her yes. she then proceeded to make little comments that she wouldn't because she wouldn't want anybody else having her dna! are you kidding me! do you know how completely ignorant you sound?  locks of love helps thousand of women and children who may be suffering of cancers or any illness in which they may have lost there hair.. you should be ashamed of your self for saying such nonsense i hope everyone reads this and gives you dirty looks,  and when i get done talking to the salon i hope they alleviate you of your duties since common sense and human decency is not a strong suit for you! next time haley keep your dumb comments to your self!"
0,"I've visited Nando's 3 times, each time has been progressively worse. The first was back in April '13 food and service was OK, not great. The last time (Oct, 13 '13) was the worst by far. We were there about 6:30 PM and by 7:00 PM the staff was clearing tables for the night, as if they were closing very soon. As mentioned by others the salsa tastes like it came out of a bottle with very little flavor, the steak for the tacos carbon was very chewy and the beans tasted like something out of a can. My judgement could have been impaired since the week before I was in ABQ where every Mexican place was outstanding. However, the wait staff was very inattentive to the point where I had to ask another server if I could get a drink refill. Needless to say I left a very small tip less than10% and vowed to never go back again. Too bad really, this side of town needs a good Mexican food restaurant and I wanted this place to work out."
0,"The girl who helped us was rude and obviously didn't want to be there. The donuts were dry and hard, not even edible. We ended up throwing them away, what a waste of money. Never again!!!!"
0,"It looked artsy and independent from the outside, but once inside I realized they were trying way too hard.  The person who took my order didn't do more than just grunt to me and didn't tell me that I could pick up my drink along a separate wall.  It was a bustling Saturday afternoon and the place was empty.  You would have thought he'd been more happy to see me.\n\nWhen the barista handed me my drink I realized they'd gotten my order wrong.  Somehow, my order for iced coffee became a chai latte.  I can't really blame the French/English barrier here as they were both speaking to each other in English.  When I pointed out that my order was incorrect.  He sighed and said that he wouldn't be able to redo it until his manager came back because it was a different price and he didn't have the authority to change it in the till.  What?\n\nNot knowing when he'd be back, I decided just to leave and make my way back to the hotel...in 90 degree F weather...with a piping hot chai latte.\n\nWhat saves this from the 1 star category is that I'll admit that it was a darn good chai latte!  Spicy and frothy at the same time.  I would have liked it much better on a chilly day, but I'll take it."
0,Whack. At 52 dollars a person I would expect better. The line is very long. I had to wait over 2 hours and another 30 minutes to get to the seafood line. The ribs were burnt. The beef brisket was too salty. The shrimps were good. The taco station was good. They make parties with handicapped persons wait in line.  It was not worth the money and especially the time for this place.
0,"Yuck!!!  If I wasn't starving and about to crash from my lean diet, I would have never came here.  \n1.) the meat is rock hard since its been sitting under the heat lamp for WAY to long.\n2.) the supposed crab legs didn't even look like crab meat.\n3.) the servers seemed to be grumpy/hate their job.  (I was thinking hey lady I didn't force you to do this job)\n4.) the asian ribs were pure fat, not even a trace of meat.\n\nI will never come back.  Save your $25 and go to Yolos Mexican Restaurant (especially if you need to keep it lean for the pool scene)."
0,"Roast duck and rice is quite good. The congee is OK. We also went back today to buy takeout, and the lady at the counter was rude as hell, being impatient in explaining the menu, and really turning me off in wanting to ever come again."
1,"A little house filled with delicious food, quaint seating and a cute patio. This pretty much sums of Coronado Cafe. I have been wanting to visit Coronado Cafe for quite awhile now and finally today was the day! This little house also reminds me of a little elf's cottage but in a really cute way. \n\nI like the food and atmosphere here. I tried the veggie wrap with chicken and it had a very delicious vinegar added to it. It was the perfect tough. I really wanted to try the goat cheese salad, but there is always next time!"
1,"Amazingly impressed with the customer service here.  I had been to 4 other stores to buy a new pricey appliance and left each time because the sales staff were rude or didn't know about their products.   Stopped by this store and I felt like I was dreaming it was so easy especially compared to the competition.  They not only price matched the other stores lower prices but threw in free shipping.  Staff answered all the questions the other guys couldn't and everything went off without a hitch.   Who knows if the rest of this store is this good as I dont often shop here, but way to go to the appliance folks!"
1,"Not typically the kind of pizza pIace I usually visit. It's a very whole in the wall type of place. I droveright past it when trying to locate it. With the amount of yelp reviews that it had and how late it was, I HAD to check it out. I was not disappointed!\n\nI ordered the spinach pizza (take-out). Delicious, not too oily and not too salty. I only wish that the bottom was less soggy, but I guess some people like their pizza like that?\n\n4/5 Would come back for late night pizza"
1,"Love this place. Family-run, family-friendly neighborhood Italian restaurant. Their take-out/delivery is so-so in my experience, so dine in--I've never had a bad meal. Their red sauce is distinctive and the pasta tastes home-made--no corners cut, nothing from a can, so far as I can tell. Warm, friendly atmosphere. Occasionally they have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. I've always gone with my 3yo in tow, and they've always been patient and kind with him. Excellent place for parents who want a civilized meal at a place where their kids will be welcome."
0,Hair in my salad. No refills. Didn't ask how my food was or how my steak was cooked. Unpleasant waitress. Need I say more?
1,"To modify a page from the Hooter's playbook, Ichabod's is \""Delightfully Creepy, Yet Refined.\""\n\nThe inside of the this place is creepy dark, almost to the point of tripping over furniture.  The small Tiffany-esque lamps on the tables and huge, heavy-looking furniture add to the quirky atmosphere.  To top it off they have someone playing a piano to a Casio-style beatbox!  It's a fun spectacle that must be experienced to be appreciated fully,\n\nI had the Neptune wrap for lunch today.  It was quite tasty.  The avocado was fresh and the French fries are coated with something that give them a little extra crunch.  I think the Strawberry Fields salad is on the agenda for my next visit.  I was offered a candied walnut from the salad by my lunch companion and it was sweet, but not disgustingly sugar crusty like your typical candied walnut.\n\nMy only real complaint is that they are used to working with a senior citizen clientele here, so service can be a little slow.  However, when we told our server that we were on a time crunch to get back to work on time today she was pleasant and incredibly helpful.  \n\nIchabod's is definitely on my list of favorites when work takes me to the east side."
0,"The first thing you notice is the smell.   If I hadn't have been starving, I would have walked out.   The place is dark and dreary, with a wait staff to match.  Clearly they have their own little dramas going on that trump customer service.  But to be fair, they do all call you \""sweetie\"" and \""honey\""  once they get around to showing up, there's the consolation. My meal came fairly quickly, so no complaints there.\n\nThe food was actually decent.  I had the smoked whitefish salad appetizer, which was a nice plate for a single diner like myself.   The platter included a nice helping of whitefish salad, cream cheese,  lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, capers, olives and pickles along with a toasted bagel.   The salad was very smoky and  tasty, and everything seemed fresh except for the olives, which were very strange and mushy.\n\nThe problem with trying to eat in a place that smells so bad and looks so dirty is that it's hard to get past all of that to really enjoy the food.  I just kept wondering what state the kitchen was in.   So, despite the decent food, I have to give this place a two star rating.   Maybe call Robert Irvine!   Unless it's freshened up and the smell is gone, I'm not going back.  Not even for such good whitefish salad!"
1,"Must see!!!! It took me back to my High School Days, I enjoyed every second. Recommend this to everyone that loves music and a great time. Boys II Men put a show that I'll never forget. Fun from the start loved the East Coast swag. I felt like I was watching my friends from back in the day."
0,"Worst place for a pastrami sandwich I ever went to, the pastrami itself was tasteless and bland it was not even pastrami it had the taste and consistancy of sizzlean, an insult to call this dried out jerky new York pastrami. Shame!!!"
1,"I visited 2 other dermatologists here in Vegas before making an appointment with Dr. Thomas. I was begining to lose hope in medicine all together based on my other experinces...but all hope was restored with Dr. Thomas. Although it took 3 months to be seen, he was FANTASTIC. He addressed all the issues I had in ONE visit, his bedside manner is wonderful, and his nursing staff can't be beat. I found a winner here and would HIGHLY recommend him."
0,"Plus side place very clean. Downside asked what kind of milk is used in the Vegan flavor. First answer I got was Whole Milk, when I stated vegan wouldnt have whole milk the guy replied he didnt know. I then asked the girl that worked there I got the same answer. Staff should know every ingredient! If they dont know then there should be a book that lists it. so I didnt get to try anything"
0,"Confused that the Yelp listing is not Todd English's Olives, as the restaurant signage, menu, and promotional materials state. I guess Todd himself dined here and had an experience similar to mine, and didn't want his name associated with the place.\n\nThe food ranged from tasty cheese on the charcuterie board and surprisingly good espresso martinis, to average/mediocre everything else- and we ordered a lot. Tables are initially served a breadbasket with three mismatched breads, and a tray of olives and two tapenades- the green is best.\n\nCHARCUTERIE BOARD: two types of tasty cheeses (one was a blue), two types of meat (salami and prosciutto?), dates, candied walnuts, and crisps. Wish I could tell you what type of cheese it was, but all dishes were presented without any sort of explanation or comment.\nFOIE GRAS: served with fresh fig (singular), port reduction (gross), and truffle crema (tastless, certainly no truffle here). Served without any sort of crackers or bread, and our breadbasket was empty and no one ever refilled it.  Did not care for the texture, flavors seemed off. Would have shared this with my server, but we never saw him.\n\nBRICK OVEN ROASTED FREE RANGE CHICKEN: served with a potato cake and green means, all amid a sea of tasty jus, but the chicken itself was bland. Recurring issue with dishes here. Again, even just salt would have helped this dish.\nBONE-IN NY STRIP SPECIAL: served with green beans and fingerling potatoes, steak was plated with a giant puddle of some sort of cabernet sauce? Guess it was meant to hide the fact that the meat was flavorless aside from gobs of fat in every bite, and unseasoned to the point that it desperately needed salt. No char or sear at all. \n\nMUSHROOM RISOTTO: decent-ish side, mediocre version of a favorite dish. The table ate the entire portion though.\nCRISPY ZUCCHINI: no menu description, expected a roasted version but received a plate of tempura zuke covered with cheese. Hard not to like that but odd considering the rest of the menu. \n\nAs you can see, we had issues with the service. The restaurant wasn't that busy, yet we rarely saw our server. Literally went 20 minutes wanting a martini that I couldn't order because he never came by. When he did, he didn't seem to care at all. We were asked what we wanted to drink, what we wanted to order, and if we had any questions- no intro, no script, no explanation of specials, devoid of personality. Didn't even ask to see a dessert menu because we were so put off by the flavorless food and nonexistent service."
1,"Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, NV was a perfect match for my recent Vegas vacation! It was was located on the Vegas Strip, within walking distance to great attractions like the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and many other great hotel/casinos. It was close to the tram access and only a short ride from McCarren Airport. The hotels amenities included numerous great restaurants (2 by Hubert Keller), clubs (Mix Lounge has THE best view of the strip), tons of pools to lounge by and even a shark reef! As for its affordability, it was a steal. I booked through southwest.com (thanks DrivenJess & DrivenTia for stalking their website). The package included airfare, hotel stay and tickets to a Cirque Du Soleil show for what I would have planned to spend just on the hotel. Split that three ways thanks to roomies and I had a little bit left over to try my luck at the tables. Tripadvisor.com gave the hotel 4 out of 5 stars and was helpful on figuring out which restaurants to try and what attractions just weren't worth the time. The room had a great view from 32 stories up and even helped us plan our walking trip to the In & Out Burger located just off the strip. Comfy beds, a big tub and the oh so lavish telephone in the john made me fell like I was in the prince's suite but only paying the price of a pauper."
1,"This tour is great. You learn a lot about Las Vegas casino history and get to see lots of beautiful old neon signs. Eventually they want to have the signs restored and working, which will be incredible. In the mean time you can see several vintage signs they've saved down on Fremont St. \nGo take the tour and contribute to the Museum....it's a worthwhile endeavor!"
1,"Decided to try a new place ,so we came here. We're seated and waited on quickly. Ordered two patron margaritas and cheesy crisp with green chile. Salsa and chile very mild but not bad. I ordered burro favorito carnitas red enchilada style. My wife had combo platter. Besides the mild chili it was awesome great flavor and good size plate. My wife loved the combo platter and these bite size what I can only explain as a ball were great tasting had oozing cheese and pieces of green chili fried in a crust. And our server Patrick was the best server we have had at any restaurant we have been to. Friendly, attentive, and alway\nMade sure we liked everything and that we were doing good. So if you come here you might want to look for this guy. Great customer service."
1,Amazing food! Some of the best french toast I have ever had! The staff is great particularly the owners. I would definitely recommend Luci's!
1,"I can't count how many times I have eaten here. I left Vegas a few years ago and every time I visit, I make sure I eat here at least once during my stay. You can't go wrong with a capistrami or a bobbie. Both are delicious."
0,"You get what you pay for, I guess.\n\nIt's two blocks from the Strip, so it's convenient. However, it's so close to the airport that the noise of helicopters and airplanes passing over you as you try to sleep makes you want to kill yourself.\n\nThe rooms are small and very below average.\n\nThe service kinda sucked too.\n\nIf you're looking for value, go elsewhere."
0,I've stayed here over ten to fifteen times over the past 5 years.  Sometimes for up to three weeks at a time.  But I am fed up with the nickel and diming.  \nThe last straw was the throttling of the internet down and an extra fee for higher speeds.  Is it not enough that we get charged for it in the resort fee?  \nI could barely check emails and god forbid I tried to surf two pages at the same time.  For a good connection I'd have to shell out another $8.99 per day in addition to the $25.99 resort fee.\nNo thanks.
0,"This has to be one of the smallest Wine and Spirits stores in the city. This place doesn't even compare to the one in Shadyside. The wine selection is decent for the size, and the people behind the counter are always pretty nice. It's a decent place to stop in if you're in a hurry and in the area, but otherwise I would recommend going somewhere else for your liquor and wine needs."
0,"I've been here a couple times and time and time again I've been let down. They have a decent selection but the staff can be very rude to the point that it would be bullying..\n\nThe first couple of times I didn't mind dealing with it. I was dealing with the owner and his intentions were genuine and he only told you what he knew.\n\nThe third time I went, a staff member named \""Bruno Mastantuono\"" crossed the line. I was a bike mechanic through highschool and I knew what I needed was a quick adjustment of the gears and a new pair of brake pads. I just moved out here and I don't have the tools here yet.\n\nHe told me I had to replace my crank, chain and hub. I told tried to explain to him that no that is not the case. He rebutted by saying he's been doing this for 32 years and rudely began hurling insults my way. He continuously cut me off while speaking as well.\n\nI decided I would only take the brake pads as I can suck up sticking to one gear.\n\nI asked him for a pair brake pads (MX2) and he says I have to take them off so he knows which is which.... for those of you who don't know, disk brakes write the type of pads they take on the outside of the lever. This is very standardized and most hobby cyclists know these as well.\n\nAnyways, I really needed the pads as mine were bare. So I took off the front wheel and he mocked me and continued to tell me that MX2 was not a thing and that I was \""stupid\""  whileI was trying to remove the pad. Fortunately a mechanic came out and rolled his eyes and passed me the brake pads.\n\nHe didn't seem too pleased with Bruno either. Anyways I have to say I have never been bullied by a salesman and he clearly knew nothing about bicycles. I ended up at a shop down the street later that night."
1,"Don't go here.  I repeat do not go.  This is the best BBQ in AZ and I want you to stay away.  Seriously.  If you go messing up my secret BBQ spot I'm gonna be seriously mad.  If you do go, do not try the brisket, the pork ribs, the beef ribs, the sausage, the turkey, or the pulled pork.  Just have like pickles and bread or something.  If you do you're gonna come back and mess up my secret BBQ spot in AZ.  Also don't talk to the owners.  They're really nice people and you'll like them and want to promote their business because it's ridiculous BBQ run by ridiculously nice people.  Then you'll tell all of your friends and they'll ruin my secret BBQ spot in AZ.  \n\nSo what I'm really saying is I already hate you all for making me wait in line for hours a few months down the road once you don't listen to me and ruin my secret BBQ spot in AZ."
0,This hotel is just mediocre. Nothing special about it. Besides the fact that it's across from saks. Rooms are very clean. Beautiful views. Long check out and check in lines.
1,"The location is right on... across the street from UNCC and next store to Brueggers, I have spent many of nights cramming for a test or getting my caffeine fix before work. Since this Starbucks is very small and always busy you have to keep you eye on a table and pounce when one comes available. The baristas are my favorite in Charlotte, they have pretty much memorized my order. They're speedy and always friendly. Good thing Starbucks is building a larger location in the same shopping center."
0,"Butterjoint has the space and atmosphere of a dive.  Which is great, right?  Well, in a word, no.  Butterjoint is not the dive that you love but rather the dive that you never want to go back to.  It has a reputation for making good cocktails, or so I've been told, and I can only imagine that reputation is used to mask a food menu that is uninspired in both design and execution.  I have eaten here twice, once with friends and the other time with my girlfriend.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.\n\nAmbiance: See above, I know of hole-in-the-walls just south of Washington Square Park in New York that have more ambiance in the limited curb appeal than this cramped and hot space.\n\nService: The service was fantastic the first time I went but I accredit this to the fact that my friends knew the people that worked here.  The second time, without that built-in relationship and rapport, my girlfriend and I were consistently ignored throughout the entire meal.  We were not greeted at the door.  We were not shown to a table.  It took ten minutes before anyone noticed that no server was taking our table, during which time our soon-to-be waitress gave a great big bear hug to, wait for it, someone that she knew.  No silverware was given with our meal.  The list goes on.  The bottom line is that quality of service is not measured by how you treat the regulars but how you perform on a consistent basis with any random customer.  Butterjoint would do well to learn and observe this maxim.\n\nFood: I've eaten better burgers at the chain restaurant Five Guys.  The perogies might as well have been Mrs. Ts from the freezer.  And the fries, I don't know how they tasted because they were cold and not worth even trying.  Burgers are an everyman type of food that is genuinely hard to make bad.  Butterjoint is impressive in that respect since it managed to do that very thing.\n\nPrice: Unreasonable cost for a burger that tastes like this.  I'd rather go to Five Guys to save money and have a much better burger.\n\nThe reputation for good cocktails: I can't speak on it since I ordered a beer; not a cocktail.  Given the aforementioned comments, I have to believe there are other trendy spots in Pittsburgh to quench my alcoholic thirst than this place.  \n\nIn summary, if you're hungry look elsewhere.  If you have a craving for a cocktail, I'm sure you can find a place that combines an inviting and comfortable ambiance with tasty concoctions."
0,Lucky I got free ticket. The lines where so long I did not even attempt to wait. Just terrible. I was going to ask a few friends to go with us. Thank goodness we did not. I would have felt terrible if anyone paid money to get in.
0,"The name \""Palatte\"" is purportedly a combination of \""palate\"" and \""palette.\""  Sadly, I found nothing pleasing to my palate here and any aspirations of artistry are just that.\n\nI had heard good things about this place and I brought the BF here one afternoon to give it a try.  We won't be back.  My guess is that Palatte is the first restaurant that Christine and Edward McHale have run.  This operation is amateurish and in desperate need of a good short order cook.  Perhaps the owners can poach one from Matt's Big Breakfast.  \n\nLet's start with the whole \""service\"" concept.  We showed up toward the end of lunch and there were several staff members lurking about.  We kept looking for a host stand and the staff saw us obviously trying to figure out what to do, but no one offered to give us any guidance.  Finally, we made our way into the house and the BF figured out that we had to order at the counter.  Palatte has decided to go with the lazy approach of making customers order at a counter and schlep a numbered marker to a table for the \""server\"" to find later for food delivery.\n\nWe decided to start off with a pineapple upside down muffin.  It turned out to be bland and dry.  Since Palatte desperately tries to lean toward the French, they should mix in some \""sucre\"" so that their baked goods actually have some taste.\n\nThe BF and I decided to split the sweet potato pancakes after hearing so much about them.  The menu proclaims that the pancakes combine sweet potatoes with mascarpone cheese, pecans and maple syrup. The end result is an abomination.  The pancakes must have been seriously over-mixed as they were absolutely rubbery and yet tasteless.  When a restaurant's signature dish is this bad, things can only go downhill.\n\nI ordered The Potato \""Mish-Mash,\"" which is really a $9 plate of scrambled eggs with potatoes, bacon, spinach, onion, Gouda and Monterrey Jack.  It was okay, but the portion was tres, tres petit.  The Breakfast Potatoes on the side were a disgrace.  They were par-boiled potatoes that had been sitting around for hours.  I know because I saw a huge pile of them in the kitchen when we placed our order at the counter.  The kitchen barely warmed them before plunking them on my plate.  They weren't even showing the faintest hint of brown.  Sacrebleu!  If you want real breakfast potatoes, go for the hash browns at Matt's Big Breakfast where you can get a decent breakfast in downtown.  But back to les pommes de terre aux Palatte; they're served with creme fraiche for dipping.  When Edward brought my plate to the table, I asked for a side of ketchup.  Edward directed me to try the creme fraiche first before he would bring me the ketchup.  Here's the deal, Ed.  I've eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the world.  I don't need to be coerced into trying your creme fraiche and it actually works better on the scrambled eggs.  I asked for the ketchup to try to mask the taste of your pathetic potatoes.\n\nA faux French vibe permeates Palatte.  This place looks like what Sage Antiques might look like if robbers broke in during the middle of the night and cleared out everything of value or perhaps a vintage southern home after the estate sale.  What's with the pile of old barrel drums in the corner of the yard?\n\nFor over $40 for two, we could have gone to a Arcadia Farms for a delightful brunch.\n\nBonne chance, Palatte.  You're going to need it!"
1,"After living in Italy for 4 years I have been on the hunt for good pizza. The pizza here is pretty close to the real thing. It had a nice thin crust and good toppings. The service was good, and the place looked really nice. I will go back again. The only thing I could say is the pizza needed to be just a little bit bigger."
1,"Went for Mothers Day brunch ... AMAZING view, great food, good service.  I can't wait to return!!"
0,"I cannot express how terrible the service was during brunch.  Our waiter completely ignored us, served all the tables around us even stopped to chat basketball with the teen next to us and flirt with the table of 30 something women next to us while our drinks were empty and we had plates piled on the table.  He brought refills and the off the buffet orders to everyone else, we never received our second off the buffet order, after over 30 minutes of waiting we gave up and asked for our check.  The dish staff brought us refills after passing our table a few times.  The food is great but we won't be going back."
1,"GREEK LEMON SOUP.  It is what is supposed to be, delicate, soft and gentle comfort food.  5 alarm chili it is not.  Lemon soup it is."
0,"Ok. Staff is not friendly at all. Often coffee canisters are empty. Surprisingly long wait for a toasted bagel (5+ minutes). They never clean toaster or slicer so every bagel you get tastes like onion. So if you buy a dozen, I'd recommend slicing them at home."
1,"Disclaimer: \nI'm not a tea expert. I don't own a diffuser. I prefer my tea iced and plain because, frankly, I'm sweet enough. \n\nIn search of the ever elusive 'thoughtful' Christmas gift for my picky sister I stopped in at Fleur de Teas in the hopes of finding something special. I wasn't disappointed. \n\nThe shop, located next to the Phoenix City Grille, is small and cozy. Don't let the size fool you, this small spot is bursting at the seams with a huge variety of tea, tea accessories and beauty products. \n\nThe staff was friendly and very helpful, walking me through several different varieties of tea until I found exactly what I was looking for. Needless to say, the gift was a hit (and very reasonably priced). \n\nI'm not a tea expert, but Fleur de Teas makes me want to be. I'll be back!"
0,"I went in to have a key that had become stuck on my MacBook fixed, and was met with an annoyed staff and made to feel like my visit was an inconvenience. I love the brand, but having worked in the service industry for over ten years, I can tell you one thing - Apple Store, West Towne knows very little about customer service. It's very upsetting to see Apple clouted by such a poor representation of what they claim to stand for."
0,Again another Chinese restaurant that pre cooks their sweet and sour chicken and anything that is deep fried. The sauces on the food were mediocre and the meat was dry and overcooked because of the precooked nature of the food.
0,"I really, really want to like The Diamond. It's cheap, convenient to my house, and my friends like it. Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things, but I'm just not even impressed enough to want to go without being decently drunk first. The first two times I went, I got breakfast food. Breakfast is kind of why I go to diners, I love it. Unfortunately, the Diamond can't manage cooking scrambled eggs. They came out rubbery and overdone both times. \n\nMy friends agreed that their breakfast is terrible and said I just had to try their lunch/dinner menu instead. Well, I gave it a shot with one of their signature sandwiches, a pork burger with onions, bacon, and cheddar. Three bone shards later, I decided I couldn't finish my pork burger and moved on to the sweet potato fries I had paid an upcharge to get. Mushy. My friend's regular fries tasted great, but they didn't get the sweet potato ones right. \n\nThe $20-for-2 dinner bill would have been a consolation if only the service had been quick enough to bring us our bill and the extra meal we had ordered. Unfortunately, just like some of our party's drinks and silverware, the server had forgotten and we had to wait another 15 minutes while they hustled it out of the kitchen. Meh."
1,"I went in last weekend for family and friends and was completely surprised! We were blown away with the atmosphere and decor we even sat down. We grabbed chairs at the bar, ordered a custom flight (choose your own 4 beer tasters), and sliders. Papago's Coconut Joe stout was my favorite. The sliders came with a quail egg and Bearnaise sauce. These are now something we get every time. The salmon was also awesome-- not your average salmon dish. And of course dessert was perfect. We have a gluten allergy and to our surprise, we were able to order a gluten free brownie with ice cream. Holy COW!! The most rich and chewy brownie. And to make it even better, the sweet baker sprinkles in her own toffee for a little crunch! We will be back again, and again."
1,"It is hard to stick out when you are a burgers and fries sort of spot.  These guys do it though - by having a great menu.\n\nI've eaten here at normal dinner hours, late night, and for lunch and I've never had bad service.  The staff has always been friendly and attentive when I've been there, but I don't ever expect miracles.\n\nSo how could I complain about good burgers and great beer?  My fave is a pint of Dales and their Morning Ride burger, with a salad instead of fries.  Awesome.\n\nTheir sides are great, don't want fries? Get tots, or sweet potato tots, or both, or a salad.  One of the best burgers joints in town.  Hope they stick around."
0,"I made a bad mistake today, I let the wife decide where we were going for dinner. She picked a Brazilian Steakhouse.\n\nNow I actually like the concept, lots of meats, cooked well, full of flavor...And way over priced....\n\nI love meat, beef, pork, chicken, hell give me deep fried budgie (google it Americans) in garlic and I would be happy.\n\nSo I am left conflicted, lots of good meat...for a price that's lets face it folks, in Vegas you can get a very good steak for, i'm sorry, but when these restaurants started showing up in Vegas dinner was $25 -$30, now they are $50 and up...Seriously, look long and hard at what you are getting, they just don't make sense...But I let the wife pick dinner...\n\nSo, after a quick \""no\"", \""But you said I could pick\"" conversation she headed of to groupon, where she came across a deal for this place....Plus she had a credit with groupon that covered the cost...\n\nOk meat plus a meal I had already payed for..Works for me.\n\nService was good, seated quickly, waiter friendly, diet coke delivered quickly, though the refill took time to come...\n\nBut it's the food you want to know about....Well frankly, the meal was \""free\""...And I think we were charged to much.\n\nThe meats were dry, the fish were cooked to death, the shrimp tasteless.\n\nThe one saving grace was desert (yes we went to an all you can eat meat place and still wanted dessert, that should tell you something)...I had the tiramisu, the wife had the cheesecake, they were both very good.\n\nIn the end there are far better Brazilian steak houses in town."
1,"This is hands down my favorite go to restaurant for any occasion.  Even just for the hell of it.  \nI've been here about ten times, I have yet to be disappointed.  By far my favorite item is the Sweet Potato Agnolotti.  I hope it comes back with the fall menu.  I've had it 4 times I've been there.\nThe bone marrow and pate and definitely another go to of mine.  My husband swears by the mussels.\nPlanning another girls night here VERY SOON!"
0,"Worst service, no room to stand in line, and crappiest sandwich I've had in a while. \nFor starters, the drive thru means there's only 4 parking spots for this tiny place. And once you make it inside, there's really only room for about four people to be in the building at one time- there are chairs and counters along the perimeter of the dining area for those who want to dine in, but there really isn't a way for people standing in line to NOT constantly bump into the seated diners. Bad floor plan.\n\nService was crappy and borderline nonexistent- I was asked what I wanted, and if I wanted it toasted, and if I wanted veggies, and then told my total. Employee was female and young and rude. After paying for my order, she handed me my receipt and walked off- no thank you or good bye, and she didn't even hand me my sandwich, which was practically behind the register. Awkward.\n\nAdd to this that there are several signs up promoting their jalapeno cheese bread, and they were out of it when I went in-- at noon on a Sunday. On top of that, when I finally ate my sandwich, there was hardly any meat on it and it was clumped in the middle with bites of bread and veggies at either end- of a six inch. \nTried the chicken enchilada sandwich and it was underwhelming. I'm confident that I had around seven Fritos in the entire sandwich, and I am not sure whether she forgot to include sauce on my sandwich or chose not to put it on- because it was really dry."
1,Steak was fantastic\nBeer selection was very good \nServices was very good. \nLocated in a great casino
1,"I like the cleanliness and the decor is just amazing. They really took the time to design the interior of this restaurant with materials imported from Vietnam. You will not be embarrassed to take a date, your friends, or family here.\n\nAs far as food I enjoyed the spring rolls and do like their Pho. Their servings are generous and the broth tasted really good. I wasn't too impressed with their crepe. We all loved the coconut with the jelly inside. I'm not a big dessert fan but boy this was quite enjoyable. So if I'm in Vegas and crave a good pho this is my place.\n\nOwner was very friendly and I was surprised their prices were almost the same as the whole in wall places we go to in LA."
0,"Don't go here if you are gluten free. Our server was pretty clueless and they couldn't prepare gf sushi. My food was cooked in the back, came out cold and I had half of what everyone else had. Had a reaction to my food. Def got glutened.\n\nAlso had to ask several times for water. My friend got the complete wrong sushi order. \n\nNot a great time at all."
1,"This restaurant has such a family feel to it!\n\nWhen we walked in, the tables were all packed with huge families and friend groups, showing you that this is a place you share with loved ones.  We were seated quickly and when the waiter came over, he asked if we had any questions about the menu (considering that half of it is written in an Asian language, I'm sure this is probably a concern!).  We ordered the Japchae, Combo plate, and a spam masubi.\n\nA few seconds later, the waiter comes back with all these complimentary apps!  What?!?!  Awesome surprise.  There were boiled peanuts, anchovies, bean sprouts, and radish/cucumber/bok choy kim chee.  I liked the bean sprouts the best; the dressing on it reminded me of seaweed salad.\n\nThen we got our food.  The spam masubi was a nice huge chuck of rice, spam, and seaweed.  The Japchae was a very large serving and it had some out of this world mushrooms and bulgogi in there.  The noodles were sweet and slightly chewy; an interesting texture.  The combo plate was excellent, a great way to try a little of everything so you know what you like.  The BBQ chicken was my favorite, and the kalbi beef was juicy and flavorful.  The Jun meat was not my cup of tea, I didn't like the egg batter.  Of course, I was really excited about the mac salad: very tasty and black peppery.\n\nI have to say someting about the waiter, because he is really what made this such an enjoyable experience.  I think he knew it was our first time there, so he kept giving us hints about what was good and how to eat some of the stuff.  He was sooo laid back, kind, funny, and welcoming, like we were best friends or something!  At the end of the night, the door opened and a big gust of cold wind came in.  My husband, who refuses to wear jackets, shivered and the waiter gave him some tea in a to-go cup to warm him up on the way to the car.  How sweet is he?"
0,Meh. What's all the hype about? It's hard to believe it's run by the same people as Monty's diner because the service and food quality are so much lower. Not worth the wait.
0,"A bunch of incompetent crew.  I called to make an appointment 4 days prior to getting the oil change.  However, the guy on the phone told me to \""just walk in.\""  So I did, and of course they told me that it would be 2 HOURS wait.  What a stupid a$$.\n\nI've decided to contact the other location and they took the appointment right away.  \n\nI will never go back to this location on 10127 W Charleston.  And if you don't have to, I would suggest you go somewhere else."
1,"First time here, friendly staff, great service and equally great food. The guacamole was awesome. The decor is very quaint and the the carne asada was good.  I would definitely recommend it, it was a great deal, especially with the coupon I found on restaurants.com. It's a little far from where I live in the southwest, but the friendly staff and good food make it well worth the drive."
0,"Just take a cab unless you like being told a 15 minute window they might show up in and then have them show up 20 minutes after the end of that window, have them damage your bag in their rush to catch up to their schedule and then subject you to listening to bible stories blaring over the radio in the shuttle. Like others have said, take a shuttle from the airport and a cab back."
1,"when i lived in california, we would travel 30 min. to hit up black bear diner.. it was a really popular spot that people would line up and wait for.\n\nwhen we moved to vegas, we were stoked that there was a black bear diner that wasn't 30 minutes away... yet was totally all that the black bear diner at home was: AWESOME.\n\nthe portions are huge.. from the breakfasts to the lunch salads.. HUGE as a bear.  \n\ni love love breakfast.. [it's my favorite food] me and my son  usually always order the grizz or i personally love the california omelette which is soooo good.  \n\nanother great from this place are the biscuits and gravy. duuude, so good.\n\nmy daughter loves their french toast and their taco salad which comes in a huge huge crispy taco bowl.  \n\nhusband loves the big foot which is a humongo chicken fried steak smothered in gravy. \n\nwe love to come here on random weekends when we feel like a big ass breakfast for brunch... it's a good place to knock out two meals because of the portions.\n\nstill love this place, in cali or vegas..."
0,Me and my family came here to rent a hotel at the HARD ROCK hotel and one of the workers just came up to me and basically keep wanting me to show my id many times I felt very discriminated by them. I talk to the AFRICAN AMERICAN security or whatever he is he thinks he owns this place and felt an anxiety from him. I felt harassed and discriminated by this place and I don't recommend the Hard Rock to anyone bad customer service and the staff needs to be retrained.
0,"After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close."
1,"I'm not sure if Safeway is a national thing (let's just say I've never seen one of these babies in Manhattan), but it's definitely needed in Phoenix and Tucson.\n\nI would drive around the city, looking at all the strip malls and low-end manicure chop shops and wonder, \""Where the hell do people go grocery shopping?\"" And while Trader Joe's is GREAT, I'd be hard-pressed to do all of my shopping there.\n\nSo thank God for Safeway, right? Although Safeway is generally a little more expensive than other grocery stores, you can pretty much get anything you need there. This particular location was so clean it was beaming! Or was that just me?\n\nIt had everything you'd expect from a Safeway--from a lovely floral department to a mini-Starbucks to a sizeable deli counter.\n\nYay for Safeway and chain shopping!"
1,k...  Here is the deal.  I would give this place a 5 if I had never had east coast italian.  Fot italian food anywhere I think this is a great place though. Really cool decor. Loved the bar. Our bartender Frank was a really cool guy.  \n\nThe fact that this place is a cougar heaven makes it extra cool (Cougars need lovin too!)\n\nI think the best italian I have had in phoenix.  Had a spinach salad and bruschetta which was SO good.  Bruschetta was one of the best I have had anywhere.\n\nHad a Sausage and peppers in a red Cream Sauce.  Very very tasty.  Food was way better than I thought it would be.  \n\nJust might go for happy hour today because I am cravin the itailian and the cougar atmosphere is a good one.
0,"I'd agree with Amber, I rarely give 1-star reviews, but if I could have given this a negative I would have!\n\nI decided to try this location as it's technically closer to where I live and I wanted to avoid the craziness of Settlers Ridge during the holiday season (I regularly go to that Sport Clips and love it)...  what a mistake.\n\nWalking in, I was rudely greeted by having a sign in sheet pushed my way without the cashier even making eye contact with me.  The wait was ridiculous for having 4 stylists going at once, and I quickly found out why.\n\nWhen I was called, I immediately knew I was in trouble.  My stylist had to be one of the most unkept people I've ever encountered.  As she walked me to her station there was hair everywhere and her tools were scattered across the counter with the cords resembling the knots she had in her hair.\n\nShe seemed far more interested in anything BUT cutting my hair, and as soon as she began, I had to immediately ask her to stop.  Her trimmers were so dull that she literally was pulling my hair out.  After asking her to change the blades, she grabbed another stylist's set (I should of run then).\n\nThe rest was a nightmare...  cutting a long story short, she provided the wrong service, billed me for the wrong service (not even the incorrect one she rendered), and my hair was a disaster.  Without getting a chance to look over it, she put a mass of gel in my hair (with all the trimmings still in it - she didn't blow dry them out, nor wash my hair like I asked her to) and slapped a ton of baby powder on my neck (so much that I had to change my shirt when i got home).\n\nAfter doing a little research, I found out that these are franchised...  hence why I'm guessing the experience was so different.  Heed the now consistently bad reviews and STAY AWAY!"
1,"This restaurant has a creative, tasty menu and very pleasant atmosphere.  We had a group of four that sat outside and feasted.  We started with the goat cheese appetizer, and it was amazing, probably my favorite dish of the day.  We also had the roasted cauliflower that my companions raved about.  For entree's, I had the Moroccan meatballs, an excellent choice.  My companions had the pulled pig sandwich, which was good, the risotto, and the definite winner of the the day, the pork chile verde with two eggs on top.  That dish was simply amazing.  Also, we tried the caramel toffee pudding, half of us loved it and half of us left it; it is very sweet.  One caveat, this is not a business luncheon place:  service is very, very slow.  We were at leisure, so it was fine with us, but this was a two-hour lunch from the time we sat down until we paid out.  But if you have time, go for the goat cheese appetizer and the pork chile verde, I will!"
0,"We went to Mimi's because other times the food and service has been exceptional.  This time however the server was rude and seemed not to care about us at all!  She walked away abruptly before we had completely given her our order.  When my food arrived it was not correct.  Instead of offering to make it correct she argued with me about \""that's always the way it comes out.\""  When I mentioned to her that it was not what had been stated on the menu she said that she would have to get the manager.  By the time he came over we were half way through our meal.  A replacement meal for me meant that I would be eating alone and my family would be sitting there with nothing to do.  Another point of contention: As we were waiting for the waitress to come take our order we could hear the manager correcting her for something - loudly!  Very UN-professional to correct an employee where guests can hear.  It made us all very uncomfortable!  It will take quite a lot for me to consider going back to this Mimi's!  When a restaurant doesn't really take care of its guests it is a sure sign they don't want my money.  There are plenty of mediocre restaurants around - I want one that is great!"
0,Over priced at $21.99 per person.  Food is gross . . . extremely noisy . . .kids running around like it is a playground.  I will never set foot in this place again.
1,"This Albertsons has a better beer selection than any other in Vegas I've visited.  The beer section is split up into two parts and the small beer section has more unique microbrews.  All cold, which is one of my complaints about Total Wine.  Most of the beer is warm at Total Wine.\n\nThe layout of this store is a little squirrely, making things hard to find.  But definitely a good place to go for unique, cold beer."
0,"It's hard to write a review for this place considering my friend and I were here for 1 minute before we were rudely shoed out. We came for drinks and the hostess said we could find at the bar. The bar was empty with the exception for 4-5 people sitting on stools. There were no more seats so we kindly asked a couple at a high top table if we could borrow their stools and bring them to the bar to sit down. The second we brought them to the bar to sit down, an employee rudely ran over to us and practically yanked the chairs from under us saying that \""those chairs can't be at the bar\"". He immediately put them back at the table and my friend and I just stood there confused and upset. He walked away and we (still standing at the bar) weren't sure what to do. The bartender stared at us and we walked out, clearly pissed, and not one employee looked at us. An absolutely horrible experience and I will make sure myself and anyone I know will never give this place a try again."
1,"Bro. After a long night of dancing, this is one of the best things you'll find around Marquee N.C.\nMy friend (who lives in Vegas) took me here after a long night... and BOY WAS I GLAD that I found this \""secret pizza\"" joint.\nIT's SOOooOOo funny that there isn't a name for this place though...\n\nPeople were asking us \""where'd you get that!?\""\nAnd I'm just like..... \""It's a SECRET MAN!\"" hahahah I'm jp.\nIf you're a rookie at vegas... U ain't gonna find it. \nIt's straight up new york style pizza and my buddy that was from New York (or they pronounce it 'new yark') said it taste just like it.\nMannnnn. seriously... just try it out (especially after  Marquee). Pepperoni, cheese, w/e you want. They got it and it's bomb. It's not even expensive... ESPECIALLY since it's in cosmo. \nWIN-WIN sonnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!\nIt tastes like 4 star. But the convenience gives it +1."
0,Me and a friend ordered some breakfast a few months ago. The service was ok and I would've given them 4 or 5 stars but the waitress forgot to supply us with eating utensils. We had to hail down a staff member to get it. I'll give this place another chance but if they fail to meet basic expectations I'm done.
1,"My wife and daughter took me to Secreto's last night for Father's Day Dinner and we were all very impressed with the menu, service and food.  There were a couple of missess, but for the most part, it is a good example of what ethnic cuisine done right can do in the \""Tuk\""!\n\nWe ordered the chips and salsa, the shrimp and the pepper and cheese apps.  They were all delicious, fresh made and promptly served.  Mind you, it was after 9pm on a Sunday, which in Awhatukee is the equivalent midnight in other neighborhoods but service was still prompt and consistent.  \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the scallops and chorizo, mw wife had the enchiladas and my daughter ordered the shrimp pasta dish.  All were expertly prepared and served piping hot (almost too hot) to the table.  My wife was a little disappointed with the crispness of her enchiladas (the tips were blackend from the hot oven) but enjoyed the taste.  My scallops with sauteed spinach and chorizo was a first for me but undoubtedly something I will order again.  My daughter is planning on having the rest of her pasta for lunch today so nuff said on her opinion.  All of the portions were sizeable  but the dinner salads got a thumbs down.  Ranch dressing with Romaine was too strong and left a bitter after taste for all of us.  \n\nGood selection of wine by the glass and beer but their signature drinks were not printed on the menu which was a miss because they have great Pear margarita's.\n\nOverall, good experience and we will definitely be back.  Affordable, good service and good food.  What else can you ask for in Awhatukee???"
1,"I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant, I was a little disappointed in the service. I was also disappointed because other people on here were able to eat the beef patties and they did not have them when I went there. This was one of the main reasons why I went there....I really wanted one. But I also ordered the curry goat because of other reviews  which was really good and also tasted the Jerk chicken it tasted more like a BBQ sauce I expected a little heat. I loved the rice and fried plantains. I overheard another customer say that the food did not taste the same like like the pervious times that she had went there.  Overall, I enjoyed the food that I ordered, I would try this place again and see if things changed and will probably call ahead of time to see if they have beef patties available. Also I would have loved to have some music playing...I love reggae and all I heard while waiting was a sports channel on a TV by the bar."
1,Great Location!!!!\n\nFree rooms?!?!?!?\n\nBathroom is large and roomy with the tub separated from the shower. Yes!\n\nOne of the cafe's sell a really good lox sandwich. They don't give out tapwater though :(
1,"Items Selected:\nWee Chicken Finger Pizza - Blue cheese, chicken fingers, and mozzarella cheese\nWee Back Home Pie - Thick tomato sauce mixed with mozzarella cheese and oregano, topped with pepperoni, sausage and Parmesan cheese with a garlic crust\nPizza Logs - Hand rolled egg roll wrappers stuffed with pepperoni, mozzarella and red sauce\nCannoli - Filled to order, two large pastry tubes with espresso mascarpone, whipped cream, chocolate chips, chocolate drizzle\n\nUsing the term 'divey' as gently as one can it would be hard to describe Moondoggies on Arville in any other way, the space itself a brick box housing old televisions, two lifetime allotments of cigarette stains, a straight-out-of-the-80s soundtrack, and the sort of patrons already drunk enough to dance and sing by noon on a Monday - plus Chris Palmeri's scratch made Naked City Pizza.  Considered by locals and even Food Network celebrities to be a local gem and decked out with Buffalo sports d\u00e9cor telling the Chef's roots it was to self seating and questionably hung over service that my family entered the makeshift dining room and presented with menus plus recommendations our order took form, a surprisingly 'artisan' quartet of items soon to roll out of the kitchen with plenty of grease but smooth pacing and just enough polish to make it work.  Starting out with smile-inducing \""Pizza Logs,\"" essentially an eggroll impregnated by a calzone, before testing out a pair of pies it was to the tunes of Tainted Love that the spicy chicken finger iteration arrived and teaming with blue cheese plus white sauce over a crispy semolina-spiked crust I immediately swooned, a 'specialty' pizza justifying its novelty while far outperforming the subsequent \""Back Home Pie\"" which tasted good but suffered texturally under too many meaty toppings and red sauce muddled by cheese and grease.  At this point duly impressed with later plans for dessert it was just as we were about to settle the tab that our server suggested the cannoli and describing them as 'filled to order' I couldn't resist - a duo of crispy tubes stuffed with espresso-mascarpone proving twice as good as those at Carlo's Bakery at nearly half the price as Duran Duran played on."
0,"I was underwhelmed with my experience at Matt's Big Breakfast, although I visited the place prompted by reviews from others.  The location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh, organic ingredients.  The breakfast fare here is nothing spectacular, although they do simple brunch foods well.  Don't expect anything fancy or fusion.  \n\nMy waffle was perfectly adequate, and while I thought the almost spaghetti-like hash browns were interesting/tasty, the rest of my table disagreed.\n\nStandard breakfast fare done simply, nothing to write home about."
0,The food was ok but nothing special for the price. The ambiance was ok. The biggest beef (no pun intended) was the overpriced wine list. I mean $55 for Liberty School is just price gouging.
0,"Overall decent.\nFor the price this place is average.  I guess in DC they have significantly better Thai.  The rice wasn't even very good.  Pad Thai has an aftertaste akin to dog food.  Milkbone's to be exact.\nPurchased Pad Thai and some mixed veggies and some special new dish shrimp and calamari peppercorn ....  We were starving and it still left something to be desired.  I'm sure some people will think this place is awesome and thats understandable,  I just think there are other places I will be visiting before heading back to this food."
0,"Food is average, just about the kind of Indian food one would expect. Since this in located inside the Rio, its prices are through the roof! There are better places in LV for Indian Food"
0,This location is CLOSED. It's an empty building.\n\nI am only putting one star up because I have to in order to post.
0,Worst service ever by Rob and the manager. \nJust asked for no chili mayo and I get a give minute speech about I better not have allergies or they can't serve me. The manager needed me to confirm I can eat everything in the burger and then substituted the fry dip even though my friend could eat it.
1,"For me, it's always been a challenge to find a really good Chinese restaurant that isn't just a buffet or takeout.  Usually I can only find these places in bigger cities like Chicago.  A couple of years ago, I discovered Jo Jo China Bistro in the Stonecrest shopping plaza and I've been back several times since, bringing local friends and out-of-town guests. \n\nJo Jo offers an upscale, yet casual, Chinese dining experience.  Its decor is modern, its menu is extensive, and there is plenty of seating in the dining room or at the bar.  I usually start with a sweet plum wine and hot and sour soup (Jo Jo makes some of the best hot and sour soup I've ever tasted).  Follow that with one of the spicy chicken dishes (and maybe another plum wine!), and I've had a satisfying Chinese dinner.  \n\nThe service isn't always fantastic, but the ambiance and food make up for it.  Say no to Chinese takeout and say yes to Jo Jo!   It's no downtown Chicago restaurant, but it's as close as you're going to get in Charlotte!"
1,"Really good food!  My friend and I shared an artichoke, bow tie pasta salad with other vegetables and aromatics in it, and a breast of chicken with spinach, tomatoes cooked with garlic, served over a pile of mashed potatoes.  Large portions, satisfactory service (would give it five stars if it was better), excellent baklava.  If I lived close to a Pita Jungle, I'd go back again and again."
0,"Now a lot of local residents will exclaim, \""Pete's Fish and Chips is the BEST!\"" but I will have to markedly DISAGREE.  It is one of the ONLY fish restaurants in the area but honestly you are better off with a chain like Red Lobster than going here.  \n\nOriginally from Southern California, I was craving fish after moving to Arizona so I asked colleagues where to find good fish. They recommended Pete's.  I ordered a TON of food in anticipation.  I was disappointed with everything I ordered.  Does NOT taste fresh, breading is HORRIBLE and you need hot sauce to cover up the fishy taste and flavor of what they serve. Extremely disappointed.\n\nIf you've lived in the desert your ENTIRE life and never ventured elsewhere or really don't know what fresh fish is MAYBE(highly doubtful) you will enjoy Pete's. If you are from the coast, don't waste your money! \n\nOh, and if you go, bring CASH.  They don't take debit cards because....hmmmm.mmmm...actually I can't think of a reason?  Oh wait! I think they make money off you using their cash machine...SWEET!(for them)."
0,"I went here with my fiance to get copies made for our wedding invitations. We waited 15 minutes. When we finally being helped, Kevyn (the employee) took another 15 minutes messing with his computer, came back and said \""can't do it\"". Cant do what? Make a copy? We took our business elseware. He also bent and smudged our wedding invite. Thanks, Kevyn."
0,"The photos your \""photographer\"" took at my brother's ceremony were absolute garbage. Your \""photographer\"" should go back to school and relearn the ART of photography and a little basic info on photoshop because i took better pictures on my canon rebel.. Sad. My mom paid $100 for a group photo and your \""photographer\"" was so terribly RUDE and made us feel we were inconvenicing him... When that was your purpose... You were providing a service and working for the couple who was getting married. Your \""photographer\"" did not even take a picture of the couple and their best man/maid of honor... Very little to absolute NO editing was done on these photos and my brother and new sister-in-law are very dissapointed about these photos and that's a darn shame because this should be one of the funnest parts of getting married, seeing the after photos. Our family lives far apart and are not together often... The most important photo we wanted to get was a decent family shot and you did a pathetic job, a D- effort. You made NO effort with trying to get the kids to smile... I do a better job in my sleep and am just a SAHM with a standard DSLR. Reverend was great but everything else was little to be desired... the rule about no photos inside of the rings or boquet was obserd... tip of advice: place the rings on a decorative surface,a delicate fabric or on the boquet and use a zoom lens... a countertop is tacky... Wouldnt recommend to a friend EVER which makes me sad because this place has such a good rep and we really really really expected so much more."
1,Amazing service! One of my favorite recipes is the baked lobster Mac and cheese. It's delicious! And a great appetizer are the pot stickers!
1,"Great discounted price! They have a wide selection of Ray-Bans. I wished they had more D&G's though and a separate section for men. Sheryl was very patient with me. She knew the style I wanted, the moment I described to her the look I was going for. Got my new glasses in 1.5 hours."
1,Great place for Sunday brunch. Blood Mary's very good.
1,"Stop the insanity! I'm not sure why The Haze has been hit with so many mediocre reviews here, because I really think it's one of the coolest and most innovative BBQ places I've ever been to. Pick your choice of meat, then have it prepared Eastern-style or Western-style (accompanied by either rice or Texas toast) - what could be simpler yet more brilliant than that? And the food is excellent - similar to the standards of the other Muramoto restaurants but at a lower price, while still maintaining locally-sourced ingredients.\n  I suspect that to a lot of people out there, BBQ means dousing a piece of meat in brownish-red glop and throwing it on the grill. Maybe they're just not comfortable with this alternative take. Or maybe it's high expectations, or jealousy at the Muramoto chain's success: I don't know! I probably would've given 4.5 stars instead of 5 if I could, but there is NO WAY this place deserves to average 3 stars! I'd hate to lose one of my favorite restaurants because of a bunch of knuckleheads."
0,"I have avoided this place for a long time because of price.  I always go to Hot Dog Heaven because they have the best prices on this side of town and they are always consistent.  \n\nBUT this review is not about them...I decided to try this place again last night and was very disappointed.  The service was good but here were the issues:\n\n1. Biggest issue, I was told I could not just order a hot dog by itself.  I wanted just 2 dogs by themselves.  I was FORCED to either get 2 dogs with fries or 2 dogs with a drink at a cost of over $9.00\n\n2.  The buns were not kept in a warmer so they were cold and the pickle was so cold it made the dogs cold.\n\n3.  Very little seaseme seeds only on top so the buns are not the same as a traditional dog.\n\nAt Hot Dog Heaven which I will go to today, you can get a dog for about $2.75 without being forced to purchase anything else.  At the place above I was told that a hot dog with fries which is close to $6.00 that the only thing he can do is take .50 off which still makes a dog twice as much as a dog at hot dog heaven.\n\nBeing from Chicago I really wanted this place to be successful because it is close to where I live but over the years, the prices keep going up and the frills keep going down....sorry but never again for me at this place..."
0,"People talk this one up, but to me it was pretty gnarly. I am definitely biased against chains, so take this for what it is, but if you're going to have locations in multiple states- please do breakfast right. Corned beef hash was not good. Not even like it could have been helped. It was not good. Won't go back unless under duress."
0,the positive reviews must have been written by people with the munchies. The tamale was decent but the donuts were heavy and the girl at the counter had no clue of what she was selling. They are currently looking for someone who can make donuts. Sign at the door said experience is not necessary.
0,"My friends and I always choose Hard Rock as the hotel to stay at every time we go to Vegas.  Our prior experiences were great and fabulous until the last visit last May of this year.   I was so livid when I checked out of this hotel. First of all, we stay at HR because we like the fact that we can go to Sunday Rehab without any problems and get in for free. As we checked in the hotel, we were told that the policy changed and we need book our room for Sunday night to get the same privileged we had before.  The front desk was trying to charge us the regular rate and said the Rehab entrance fee was about $100-$250 per person.  We opted for another room and managed to get in ourselves for free at the door.  We felt like they were trying really hard to get us to stay one more night and pay a higher room rate.  \n\nI was so livid when I checked out of the hotel.  One thing for sure is that I will not stay at Hard Rock going forward.  I feel that they use the pool party to act \""big and mighty\"" and lost their great customer service they once had.  \n\nNext trip will definitely be at Encore and my Sunday Rehab days is over.  This experience totally turned me off!!"
1,"Had the flank steak and grilled shrimp. Steak was a bit chewy for med rare, but shrimp wad delish. The strawberry pi\u00f1a coladas are good with an extra shot of 151! We had half off coupons for our entrees and the Yelp checkin offer for a 2 for 1 drink - can't beat that!"
1,"The new location passes the smell test!  We had the red curry chicken and the chicken pad thai.  I really liked the consistency, flavor and spiciness of both of the dishes.  They could have been a little more generous with the chicken and shrimp.  \n\nThe bathroom is nice and clean.\n\nI like the new location and I like the decorations.  However, they need to break the space up a little bit with some divider walls or hanging dividers and lights that come down from the ceilings on the tables.  It is a little too much like a big open auditorium.  \n\nThe service was fabulous!"
0,"My first review although true was unfortunately filtered so if you would like to see it please read the filtered reviews. I also wanted to update my experiences. Although everything that I said in my original review is true, the customer service has become a bit better. I also noticed that things have been in stock more often. In the past month or two new managers have been running the store and that may be the reason why. It's not where it needs to be yet, but headed in the right direction."
0,Claim to be the Best steak in Las Vegas years in a row. I would rate their steak with IHOP or Denny's. Poor quality meat. Tasted tough definitely needed a sharp steak knife. I think the only thing to get  there is breakfast and even then it doesn't seem like anything special. The decour was interesting and retro.
1,"The wife and I ate here on our first trip to Las Vegas before we got married. I can still taste the ground pork and ginger pot stickers, drizzled with a soy glaze and thinly sliced scallions.  This is were we both fell in love with sushi, and for  good reasons. It was here where we dared to use chopsticks, and haven't looked back since. Thanks Wolfgang,  it was at your restaurant where are love for dining started together."
0,"As happy as I am that I'm married, I have no happy story to tell thanks to Vegas weddings!  My fiance and I wanted to quickly get married in a fun way to take care of some legal stuff before our actual real wedding in a year and a half, and we discovered that not all Vegas weddings are like the fun ones you see in the movies and Vegas commercials.  First off, do not even try to joke about the sanctity of marriage or you might be thrown out.  My fianc\u00e9 and I are both pretty sarcastic fun loving people who just wanted to be fun and sarcastic together for the rest of our lives and we did not appreciate the lectures that we got from the pastor and the very sour and unfriendly staff about how we were in a serious wedding chapel.  Secondly, come with your own pocket flasks because you will be waiting a long time and will be met with condescending glares should you mention alcohol.  Lastly, stand firm my friends, no posed picture after the ceremony is worth $10 a photo with a minimum purchase of ten photos.  This place is all about squeezing as much money out of you as possible.  If you go for one of the cheaper packages expect horrible service!  Go to one of the million other cheap looking chapels on Vegas blvd.  You are sure to have more fun!!!!"
1,"What a Steal! La Tour Belvedere Suites Apartments was. It is exactly what  how it sounds, it is a suite apartment. It's very big and spacious for a Studio Queen which is was i purchased for my gf and I during our stay in Montreal. I can only imagine what the Suites were like space wise. I kept my eye out on Booking.com for there flash deals and low and behold they had a deal that came out to $83 dollars each night, we only stayed for one. Upon arrival the concierge's at the front desk were very prompt and got us sorted away quickly and even took the time to tell us where to go in the city, directed and made marks on one of the tourist maps (seriously A triple plus for that type of help) When we got upstairs into the room i was extremely pleased, didn't realize how spacious it was and it had a nice balcony for us to go outside and enjoy the fresh air. Balcony wasn't the cleanest area but no big deal. I really had no complaints about the room, the bed was decent pretty comfortable, nice couch, small tv, even a kitchen with a few glasses, kettle etc. the basics if you bring back food or drink to the room. The shower was a bit small but honestly really was no big deal. \n\nI think the biggest plus of this Hotel was the service, on top of that it was a street over from Rue de Saint Catherine were most of the night life occurs and Boulevard De Maissoneuve is the second main street so there is alot going on , on this strip as well. Also it was across the street from a 24 hour eatery which came in handy late night for my gf and I who were starving. Also i liked the fact that unless you had a card and you were staying at the hotel, after hours (late night) you couldn't get into the hotel with out swiping, very very very good security measure. Honestly i thought this hotel was great for the value and i would absolutely stay there again, one thousand percent!"
0,"Not very good. Lady behind the counter was really standoffish while I was asking my questions. Best part of the whole meal was the side of sliced avocado. Beans and rice were unflavorful and the beans taste canned. However they gave me a ton of food, so if you like quantity over quality this place might be good for you."
1,"Well, I must say that I was surprised by this store when I walked in. I thought it was going to be a dinky little store with really crappy items. Boy was I wrong. This store is almost a full on grocery store! They have a lot of name brand items, which I was amazed by. \n\nI wouldn't buy produce here as most of it is bad or 1 day from going bad. The store kind of has a faint smell of rotting vegetables, then again, I do have a very keen sense of smell. \n\nI think it's funny that they call this a 99\u00a2 store. When I looked at my receipt, every item rang up as $0.9999. Since when do we carry out the price of things four decimal places? I mean, I thought gas stations were the only weird ones...apparently not. I mean, they should just call this a dollar store or the .9999 store. Haha. On their bags, it says they're open 9 days a week. Cheesy. \n\nAnyway, I bought some hand sanitizer, some otter pops, and 15 egg cracker gadget things to resell. My total bill was $18 and change. Not too bad. \n\nAside from the poor produce section, the store was pretty neat and well organized. It was also well lit and spacious."
0,"The only good thing about this place is that it's open Saturdays and a very nice dental assistant. Other than that I would not suggest this dental office. My husband and I went in for a dental exam/ cleaning/ X-rays - or so I thought, they just took exams and gave us a list of what was wrong with our teeth and the cost. The receptionist was not easy to talk to , and it was hard to understand her when I asked questions."
0,"Slow as molasses and got my order wrong. I ordered one iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla. How do you mess that up? I was the only customer in the drive through and it wasn't busy inside. No excuse for the incompetence. After reading the other reviews, they just don't care here apparently."
0,"Denny's.....slow service, ok food....expensive prices....but cheaper than a fine dining experience.....I won't be back.....I'm a foodie, and I prefer to spoil myself on places like N9NE"
1,"This is a new restaurant in the neighborhood. We were hesitant at first. However, once  our salads arrived, the taste was great and the veggies on it were generous. My daughter had chicken on her salad, the chicken was an entire grilled breast, much more than expected!!!\nThe spicy Thai salad dressing was great. We will be going back. My only suggestion would be to have more veggie options for the build it yourself salad, like cucumbers, carrots, mushrooms, etc."
1,"I brought in a bike tire for repair because new tubes kept going flat. Within minutes they had it pulled apart, discovered a metal bur, filed it down, and installed a new tube with the existing tire. I purchased a few other items while I was there and left paying less than $18. I did not find them pricey at all. The time and hassle they saved us from doing it ourselves was priceless! Very knowledgeable, friendly, and fast.\n\nNo bike parking because the City of Surprise prohibits it."
0,"Manager was far from happy to be at work today.  Sewage smell very strong when you walk in and in restroom. General cleanliness issues.  Trashcans smelled horrible. While waiting for a fryer to be available, frozen chicken was placed on fryer shelf which had grease buildup on it."
0,"Running through the neon lights of the Strip at night.  A fun adventure for family and friends to tag along. It's an alluring concept.  I can see runners still signing up DESPITE THE HORRENDOUS REVIEWS FROM THIS YEAR. \n\nIf you're one of those brave (or foolish?) runners, go prepared.  Here are my tips on what I'd do differently, if I only knew! \n\n1.  TAG ON VACATION DAYS AFTER THE RUN, not before. The run is Sunday, so it's tempting to want to have a vacation weekend by arriving early.  But if you're a serious runner, you can't drink, you can't overindulge in foods out of your routine, you shouldn't smoke second-hand--you basically won't get to do any of the things that make Vegas fun!\n\n2. LINE UP YOUR PRE-RACE MEALS AHEAD OF TIME--and have back-up plans anyway!  Room service at the hosting hotel (Mandalay Bay) on race day was 1.5 hours backed up.  The line for most restaurants and buffets in the vicinity was about 1 hour just to get seated, with food service delayed.  Even the ready-to-eat carbs were mostly gone at the cafe--I grabbed the very last sandwich and scone at 11:55am, 4 hours before the race!  I suggest pre-ordering room service the night before or making reservations AND placing your order at one of the non-buffet restaurants beforehand, and still have a couple of back-up PBJ sandwiches and bananas just in case things don't work out.\n\n3. LINE UP DINNER POST-RACE AHEAD OF TIME. Getting out of the race area took hours, after which it took more hours to find food.  I suggest arranging for room service ahead of time to avoid the mess of people.\n\n4. AVOID GEAR CHECK. It was a disaster trying to retrieve items at the end.  For race start, your friends/family can go all the way to the corrals with you, so you can hand them your jackets then.  Or just buy something from the thrift store you can throw away.  For race end, grab plenty of space blankets, and have family/friends bring you lots of warm layers (and a thermos of hot chocolate perhaps!).\n\n5. CHECK OUT THE FINISH AREA AHEAD OF TIME, and scout a way back to your hotel or a meeting spot that is FAR AWAY from the shortest/main route indoors.  This was a major disaster as all the runners and their family and friends headed towards the Mandalay Bay after the run--understandably so, as it was COLD.  But the jam just to get to my room (at the Mandalay Bay) was almost 1 hour.  Not only annoying--but seriously DANGEROUS.  Many runners passed out.  As the runners mixed in with the Vegas revelers in the crowd, I kept worrying--one drunken scream of fire, and there would have been a major stampede.\n\n6. HAVE ENOUGH OF YOUR OWN WATER FOR THE ENTIRE RACE.  Many runners got sick this year because the water handed out by volunteers was very unsanitary (from big trash cans).\n\n7. FULL MARATHONERS, MAKE YOUR TIME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN THE FIRST HALF.  The second half, just be mentally prepared that you'll be merging into 40,000+ half-marathoners.  You'll find out how narrow the Strip really is.  (The half marathon starts 1.5 hours after the full, on the exact same course.  Unless you're an elite who can run the first half in less than 1.5 hours, you can't avoid the merge fiasco.) \n\n8. BETTER YET, JUST DO THE HALF MARATHON INSTEAD.  The first half is through industrial Vegas--you might as well be in Detroit.  Only the 2nd half is on the Strip, and if you're fast, you can maybe outrun the crowds and the merge fiasco.\n\n9. WEAR A HEADLAMP.  There were stretches of dark areas--both in the first half and second half--with serious potholes.  (They gave one out as a freebie this year, but failed to mention its necessity in any communications to runners before the race.)\n\n10. BOOK YOUR MASSAGE SEVERAL WEEKS AHEAD OF TIME as they fill up.  If not, call the morning of and see if there's a cancellation (that's how I got mine).  I highly recommend the Spa at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay, as they have hot and cold tubs you can soak in before/after your massage."
1,"The ribs here are superb! Honestly, I haven't ventured off of them to the rest of the menu. We have been there LOTS and I get the ribs every time. With sides of broccoli and smashed reds, it really can't be beat! I don't know what they do to them, but I crave them often!  \nI gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because sometimes the food is only good, but most of the time it is great! The service also varies from good to great!"
0,"At first I thought this place was awesome because of the AYCE option and their extensive menu for AYCE, but food portion and service are horrible here.\n\nThe nigiri were really tiny, probably the smallest pieces of nigiri I've ever seen. I don't know if they did that on purpose or what. The kimchi fried rice, uni, and fried banana dessert were my favorites of the night. I usually love poke, but their poke had a couple of tuna cubes and lots of seaweed. After about an hour of service, our waitress didn't come by our table anymore. I'm sure some of us were still hungry, but the absence of our waiter and food was long. The longer we waited, the fuller we got. Maybe they did this on purpose?\n\nOur orders of soft shell crab and scallop roll never came out even after telling our waitress three times . Needless to say, I'm never coming back."
1,I just spent 6 days at the Signature and I am pretty sure this is my new favorite!\nI have stayed at the MGM Grand many times in the past and have always enjoyed it but this was my first here.\n\nThe good: \nPRICE!! I went through a suite owner and got a nice suite for about 25% less than a normal hotel room with no resort fees.\nVery nice staff and amenities\nStarbucks right in the lobby of tower 1\nYou don't have to trek through the casino unless you really want to\nVery short walk to the monorail\n\nThe bad: \nIt is pretty far away from everything...honestly this is a plus AND a minus in my book\n\nThis place is great if you are here for business or conventions when you don't care about time in the casino's.\n5 minute walk to the Monorail station and a 10 minute walk to the strip are worth it in my book.
0,"I came here with a buddy of mine around 6:00 in the evening on a Wednesday. Against my wishes, we sat in the dining area instead of the bar. \n\nThe booth - WAY TO SMALL. I'm a skinny guy - 6' tall 165ish. I had to sit \""side saddle\"" to feel somewhat comfortable. For those who don't know what that means, I had to sit SIDEWAYS with my legs on the seat, and my feet hanging off the end. \n\nThe atmosphere was devoid of life, and completely drained of energy. There were two other tables seated in the section. \n\nThe waitress had no idea what beers they offered, and had to read off a list. She also had no clue if they offered any season selections that might of had fruit flavoring of any kind.\n\nWhen she came back from \""investigating\"", she said they offered a hard apple cider. I ordered one along with an Italian beef. I've worked for a NNY in the past, and thought it to be a safe bet - bread, meat, cheese, au jus, fries. The sandwich could of been taken out of the salamander sooner, as the top had some burning to it.\n\nMy friend had boneless wings - I'm not even going to waste time talking about deep fried, frozen commercial \""meat chunks\"". \n\nI don't go out to eat very often, but I do work as a chef. In aware of the difference between a horrible-great place is; I've worked for all in-between.\n\nI knew I was in for low quality food, but for as DEAD as it was, I'd expected to see them at the top of their game.\n\nThis was mediocre at best.\n\nAt least the hard apple cider was good."

1,"YUM!!!!!\n\nThis is one of my favorite Thai places - especially at lunch! My whole company (4 people) can eat here for like $30! \n\nThe pad Thai lunch special is insanely tasty and leaves me full for the rest of my work day. If you like Thai, give this little place a go!"
1,Love it...spicy and flavorful!  Great prices!  Service is a little slow but it's worth the wait!
0,"On a morning breakfast hunger, we didn't feel like eatting buffetts with the regular eggs, sausages, omellettes.  We had a craving for some good old fashion \""Jook\"" aka rice porridge.  We didn't wanted to go to Mandalay Bay which charges $25 for a Seafood Jook as compared to $4 in SF Chinatown.  So we picked the next best thing...in LV Chinatown and came about Sam Woo.  \n\nWe ordered  a Fish Porridge which still had a strong fishy smell and taste, (usually removed with ginger) and the porridge was extremely watered down.\nWe also order the \""Sam See\"" chow mein (Duck; Chicken; and BBQ Pork)  It was ok, but tasteless...probably by the extreme amount of water sprouts!\n\nSomehow, when we got back to the hotel that night, our stomach wasn't feeling too good."
0,Don't know what I ordered here but it was dirt cheap. Probably less than $3.\n\nYou get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy. There's an 80% chance that Sam could be serving you. Say hi.
1,"Do you wear light flannel in the summer and listen to Decembrists? This place is for you! \n\nBut really, if you're looking for atmosphere maybe you'll go to Michelangelo's. But if you want straight up well made coffee and vegetarian breakfasts, this is the place."
1,"This place is the ultimate place for an awesome great tasting american style mexican food. \n\nI was introduced to this place by a knockoff in vegas, that was soon replaced with the real deal and have yet to find anything in this place i do not like. \n\nEveryone I have brought here has loved it and become a fan. The enchiladas are awesome and my wifes favorite. I like a pork burrito with mild sauce black beans and rice....the flavor will stick with you forever. \n\nI highly recommend this to anyone! I do wish they would open up more locations in the valley so I can let my other family members in surprise fall in love.\n\nI even had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner..."
1,"Yelp, your mobile app has taken me home again!\n\nIt's nice to have a spot that has not significantly changed in the 20+ years that I have been a patron...even tho nearly 20 years has passed between my last visit and my most recent.\n\nCasey Moore's Oyster House patio was the spot one of my instructors selected for the lecture portion of his class.  Every Tuesday, from 2-3:30 PM, we sat at a table and discussed designing costumes/lights/sets/sound for ASU theatre productions.  Between the munchies and the black and tans, our discussions became quite animated and we certainly considered more creative design concepts.  It was quite cool to be able to have class and a beer (or 3) at the same time.\n\nFast-forward from 1989 (my first experience at Casey Moore's) to 2011 (my return to Tempe for work).\n\nThe food is still outstanding, the location is easily accessable, the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable.  The prices, unfortunately, are a bit higher than other places."
1,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. If I lived in Montreal, I'd be a regular here. Looking for a good late night meal, my boyfriend and I came here around 1130 pm-- 30 minutes before closing. I expected to get dirty looks  from staff who wanted to close up shop and to be rushed through our meal. Instead, we were greeted warmly, given great service and the food was top-notch. \n\nWe tried the corn fritters, which were super yummy. I had the braised beef, while my boyfriend tried the bangers and mash for entrees. We could not have asked for a better meal. \n\nThis is a must-go-to place for locals and visitors alike."
0,"Great coffee, good croissant, but horrible service. Skip this place and head down to Le Cartet which is ten times better and  amazing service."
0,"I was so looking forward to trying this place. The decor is awesome. \n\nHere comes the bad news i guess if you dont drink alcohol at this restaurant you get bad and slow service. They wanted us out of there pretty quick the waiter took one of our plates before we finished, they took our dishes pretty quick. The food was bland i couldnt believe it. \n\nOverall i would not suggest this place unless you order drinks first. Maybe i should of worn a suit and tie."
1,"Kiss The Cook has one of the best (if not the best) eggs benedict I have ever had, given that I'm a huge fan of eggs benedict. The gravy is amazing! Sausage is not too salted (which is usually the case at other places) and eggs are perfectly poached in a way that yolk is still runny but doesn't spill all out when cut. The mini muffins offered before the meals are ridiculously delicious - not too sweet, not too oily, and not to filling. I would definitely come back if I visit Arizona again."

1,"Tucked in a strip mall on E. Sahara Avenue, Lotus of Siam is a major hit for excellent Thai cuisine. We experienced this little gem on a Friday night and, at least that night, I'm glad we had reservations. The restaurant was packed. So, consider yourself warned ... we were told they would only hold reservations for five minutes. You snooze, you lose.\n\nThe restaurant is somewhat casual, so shorts and a tee-shirt would have sufficed, but a few of our group of four were dressed for a show and gambling at one of the upscale properties. Each of us would have felt comfortable either way.\n\nThe delight of Lotus of Siam is not the decor or the layout; it's the food. Sooooo good. And there are more selections than one might need -- but who's to complain?! We ordered four entrees: Garlic Prawns (at the suggestion of the server); Chicken Panang; Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles (again, at the suggestion of the server); and Pineapple Fried Rice.\n\nAll were excellent choices. The Garlic Prawns topped with ground black pepper were oh-so-lightly deep fried in their paper thin shells. No need to peel these crispy little delicacies -- eat 'em shell and all! The Chicken Panang contained plenty of thinly sliced chicken breast medallions soaking in a heavenly, light curry/coconut/basil/chili sauce. You may need to keep the sticky rice bowl handy, as the Panang and sticky rice mix well together. The Sea Bass with Drunken Noodles had a nice contrast of flavors between the fresh chili and Thai basil, while the fish itself maintained the mellow flavor characteristic of good sea bass. And, finally, the Pineapple Fried Rice containing curry powder, pineapple, shrimp and chicken was a good little addition -- especially with the contrast of the pineapple to the traditional Thai flavors of the other entrees.\n\nI can't eat Thai food without a Singha lager beer, which I enjoyed. Others in my group shared a bottle of wine from a reasonably long list of wines from various areas of the world. (They selected a Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand -- which at least is from the same hemisphere as Thailand!)\n\nThis was the best Thai food restaurant that I've been to, hands down. And I've been to Thailand!"
0,"I usually love love love this place, but my experience last week was underwhelming. We visited on Friday night and made a reservation for 9:30 through opentable.com, even though we probably didn't need one, as the restaurant was emptying out. \n\nWe usually order a range of the small plates and sushi. Friday was no different. I ordered the TNT roll, tuna tartare, and the rock shrimp tacos. \n\nAfter a long wait, the tuna tartare was served first. It was tasty, but needed some salt. Also, it didn't taste particularly fresh. It should have been served colder. \n\nThe TNT roll was good, but it was not particularly special. \n\nThe shrimp tacos came last. The tiny shrimp were ice cold. We sent them back, even though we never send food back. They served us a fresh set of tacos and they were fine. Nothing special. \n\nTamari has been one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh. The first floor looks shabby. It could use a paint touch up or some deep cleaning. \n\nOur service was off. At times we couldn't find our waiter. \n\nThe weirdest thing was that manager/owner (big man in a big suit) was running around checking on the kitchen and talking to workers, as he has done each time I have visited Tamari. As the kitchen is open to the diners, it stuck me as odd that the big man in the big suit has never ever approached one diner to ask about their experience any time that I have visited."
1,"Always excited when I drop in at Cugino's! I get my favorite sandwich, which I don't believe is even on the menu. The Donny Special...you can't go wrong. It's a secret so shhhh. Of course they get it right with their pizza. This place is authentic which is tough to find in Vegas. Frank, Donny and Company are awesome! Thanks for the great food."
0,"I seriously have no idea why people eat here where there are 100 better alternatives for Mexican food in this town. We had a shredded chicken chimichanga, green corn tamale, and chicken enchilada. All 3 were bland and tasteless at best and all three were very greasy. If you think Taco Bell is great Mexican then this is your place, otherwise, steer clear, go home and pop open a can of processed tamales from Del Monte, you'll get a better meal."
0,We a group of 4 were seated at a booth. They brought our drinks and told us they had a party of 8 that walked in an we needed to move to a small table. How rude is that. They just wanted the 18% gratuity at the cost of loosing customers. They did not ask kindly they just wanted us to move. Unreal to be treated this way. I guess we will never go back.
1,"After bouncing around from mediocre to mediocre salon experiences for years, I decided to solicit the help of yelpers a few months ago and dig deeper into finding a stylist I actually like in Scottsdale.  I found a ton of amazing reviews for Eric Flotta at Green With Envy... but when I called they told me he had actually just opened up his own salon across the street inside Sachi called The Green Room.\n\nI'm so glad I tracked Eric down, because he is as awesome as his other reviews say!  He's great at what he does, totally down to earth, and easy to talk to.  I loved my haircut, and the salon was beautiful without being too characteristically Scottsdale pretentious.  \n\nI live in LA but Scottsdale is home, so I'll definitely be booking appts with Eric whenever I'm back in town."
0,"Save your money and skip Salty's... This place went downhill with the new spot. Customers service was a joke, to-go food was lousy to say the least (chicken fajitas undercooked, dried-hard rice.. and flour tortillas when the menu reads CORN tortillas) I finally had to flag down a server and ask her to check on my food. The bartenders where too busy flirting with the staff to offer another beer while I waited or update me on the food.\n\nThere are plenty of spots in Old Town... I doubt I'll be back"
1,"Excellent location, just around the corner from the Metro. Better to get a higher room and away from the street noise. Breakfast bar was great, staff was friendly. Highly recommended"
0,"First of all, I come here with my family and walk into a crowd of people in line.. There was an older lady, Im guessing the \""owner\"" that came to help us,I got 1 kids scoop and 2 regular scoops of Ice cream.. I was getting ready to pay when the lady handed me my last scoop of ice cream saying \""Have a great day\"".. too me I thought that these scoops of ice cream were on the house being as the bigger group before me was still in front of the cashier paying.. I said \""are you sure?\"" to the lady when she replied, \""Have a good day\"" In my head I was thinking.. wow what a kind lady to give us free ice cream.. then I walked away and sat down with my family.. I told my husband this and he said he would leave some tip just because he wanted to be nice.. As we walk out and my husband places the tip in the tip jar, the lady said to me.. \""oh I still need to ring you up, right?\"" I was in shock... on top of that I felt so humiliated, thinking that these scoops of ice cream were on the house... She asked me if the tip my husband left in the jar was the money we were going to use to pay for the ice cream.. I told her no, he wanted to leave tip.. She was gonna ring me up with two kids scoops and a regular scoop.. I corrected her saying two regular scoops and a kids scoop and paid my $9 bill.. I am not the type of person to run out on my bill and I was more than happy to pay in the beginning.. She confused me soo much on top of making me feel like a complete idiot.. maybe I missed her saying to pay later on top of the loud crowd, but I was humiliated... Horrible customer service... She also gave me \""expired\"" coupons, telling me it would still be valid.. which if I ever go in here and get humiliated again by having expired coupons.. I don't know what I would do... Needless to say.. I am never going to this baskin robbins again after the customer service that left me feeling horrible!!"
1,"Its a Vegas landmark. Everyone in the nightlife industry comes here after work, 5/6am for breakfast.\nHUGE portions, but rather pricy for locals. But its a retro diner type, it has an intertesting decor andthe food is ok. \nService is a little slow at times.\n\nCome around 2/3 am and its full of drunken tourists :)"
1,Great food. Good atmosphere. good prices. Highly recommend this place!!!
0,"It is nicely decorated though I think the plasma TVs in the dining area playing an Arabic version of MTV are out of place.   Their mezze, an assortment of appetizers, seemed outrageously overpriced at $24, so we ordered baba ghannou, roasted eggplant with lemon juice and garlic dip served with warm pita triangles.  It was good, but I thought the addition of olive oil detracted from the taste and texture.  My wife's entre was kafta kabob, minced lamb with chopped onion and spices and served with tziki sauce while I ordered lamb kabob.  The kafta kabob was too light on the spices.  I ordered the lamb kabob medium rare and it ended up being both fatty and overcooked.  Our entrees were accompanied by rice and a bland salad."
0,"Unfortunately, my tapes were not there.  They must have been the ones that Clayton took to his home in Queen Creek to work on.  I called his wife, Angela, and ask her to do the \""right thing\"" and just collect all the tapes that are around the house and take them to the \""downtown mesa association,\""  but apparently she doesn't think she has any involvement."
0,"I'm sure Dr. Gentile is a fine doctor and a good person but when when my husband and I were interviewing pediatric offices I found Dr. Gentile to be annoyed by our questions about alternative shot schedules and he stated that they only follow the APA's vaccine schedule and then he proceeded to tell me what horrible things might happen to my baby should we not follow the schedule. \n\nI understand that vaccines are important but we chose a different pediatric office because we live an organic lifestyle and chose to go with a variation of Dr. Sears' shot schedule (our kiddos do get all of the shots, just more spread out), and this other office was willing to work with us. Dr. Gentile's office was just not right for us.\n\nBy the way, we chose to go with Desert Shores Pediatrics, they are great!!!"
1,"KMLE Country is one of my fav's to listen to.  They play modern country music, not that \""twangy\"" old school country stuff....not to say that's bad, but I'd rather listen to the newer stuff.\n\nAlso, they put on some great events with Country Thunder and the 8 Man Jam.  Both of those events rock!\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
0,"The item you pick for your dinner can quite literally make or break the experience here.  That is, your cheesy, Americanized Mexican food experience.  I tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful.  No cheese anywhere, no flavor, just HOT.  Ok yes, the menu indicates this a \""spicy\"" dish, but it didn't indicate its high degree of suck.  \n\nUnfortunately on this particular visit we didn't get a hot waitress.  Instead we got a disenchanted guy who apparently didn't want a very big tip.  His heavy sighs, eye rolls, and general lack of even being around 99% of the time led me to believe he was channeling his inner emo and couldn't be bothered.  \n\nWe were sat next to a group of teenage girls, which by automatic default says \""we hate you and want you to die.\""  They talked very loudly about their sexual escapades and did that annoying screech laughing.  I get it, I was a teenager once too, but if I could go back in time I'd kick my own teenaged ass.  \n\nThe food, service, and ambiance was like the time I fell off my motorcycle and got really bad road rash.  I hope I won't be doing that again any time soon."
1,"At first we were a bit put off that the wait was going to be over an hour but there looked like there were plenty of open tables. We assumed that there was a large party reserved. They offered us a table off the bar area that was better than most of the tables in the regular dining area. Great view of the people walking by and coming in to the restaurant. Our server, Dennis, was excellent. He was very attentive and courteous. It didn't feel like we were sitting at the bar at all. He even noticed when one of us dropped a utensil and came right over to check up on us. The food came out at a decent amount of time and was very good too. We hope to visit Aria again soon."
0,"The place stinks of smoke like when it was the Imperial. The rooms are tiny. The WIFI works about half the time or less. The casino area is small, the only saving grace is the staff are attentive.\nThe bars and restaurants on the walk way are all nice."
0,"What a joke. Worst service I think I've ever received. I feel bad for the owners of such an awful establishment. We went because reviews on yelp. Awful. Vegetables weren't cooked all the way through. We were one of 3 tables and had to wait 30 minutes for food. We all ate cereal at home it was so bad. Cold, not cooked, no flavor. Shame on Susie."
1,"Carne Asada fries!! That's it. Get those and you will love yourself. They are enough to share with someone.\n\nThe tacos are good too, but I'm just saying. I liked the tacos al pastor and the asada ones. The chicken tacos were my least favorites. But they were still good. \n\nI came here with a party of 8 HUNGRY people--and they did a great job getting our stuff together. There was a little confusion, as we were missing some tacos, but the employees there were really friendly and were helpful."
0,"If I could no stars I would. We Wanted to try out the new local Zipps but were sadly disappointed. We were seated quickly and just sat there for 16 minutes without a single server to even take stop by with a simple \""I'll be right with you\"". The table next to us had been could tell of our frustration and the gentlemen said they ordered burgers 45 minutes ago and still hadn't received them.."
0,"Great selection of products, fairly expensive but about the same prices as other health food stores.  However the staff overall is apathetic and unfriendly.  I visit this store every couple of weeks and each time I go in no one greets me, and if I ask where something is the staff appear annoyed to be bothered and point me to the aisle.  The cashiers are pleasant, but no one looks happy to work there.   I expect that kind of customer service at Walmart, but at a place where one can easily spend $100 on two bags of groceries I sort of expect better staff attitudes."
0,"Went to the chocolate factory had delicious samples and decided to buy some chocolate, while I was looking to see which ones I wanted their was an elder lady I believe her name is Judy. She rudely asked if we where ready so we told her we where still looking she rolled her eyes and sighted loudly throwing her gloves in the trash annoyed. When she came the second time around to see if we where ready we told her we had a question and left us talking to ourself and went to the cash register to fold boxes. Then a young African American lady came and helped us very nice lady. I was shocked at how rude she was I wanted to talk to a supervisor but my husband just wanted to leave and didn't let me."
0,"If you are just looking for great smoothies, then this is the place. Anything else, SUCKS! \n\nCase in point: I took my wife and two boys there for lunch. I ordered the wasabi roast beef, my kids shared a salad, and my wife got a turkey sandwich. The sandwiches were about 6 bucks and some change. The salad was about the same price. This is where the FAIL is. The sandwiches were very small. I would have to eat at least 3 of them just to get rid of my hunger. The salad itself actually looked more satisfying then my roast beef and my wife's turkey! At 6+ bucks for a tiny sandwich I knew I wasnt coming back here for their \""food\"". I had to get a mango magic smoothie just to get that \""satisfied\"" feeling in my tummy. As the name implies, smoothies are the only thing good that they have here, hence the two stars.\n\nService was so-so. My wife asked about their soup of the day. The cashier said they ran out. Really? Its only 12:10 in the afternoon and you ran out? The truth was they obviously didnt make any cuz I noticed the big container you would normally put soup in was ridiculously spotless. If they ran out then the container would have some evidence of something right? Dont tell me yall actually cleaned it right as it ran out!\n\nSo from now on its nothing but smoothies for me if I ever venture in to any one of these places."
0,Food was pretty poor. Service was also bad. Constantly being rushed to clear out. Would not recommend.
1,Really enjoyed the taco salad I got. Authentic food and fresh tasting. Really enjoyed the dressing on the salad.
1,"I think this place can be considered a hole in the wall kind of place since it is very tiny and the only beverage served here is water. It's open and bright but I still had a claustrophobic feeling the whole time here. \n\nThe menu is very limited and more limited than the picture of a menu posted a while back.\n\nI tried the chicken shawarma plate that came with two sides and picked what they called spicy carrot salad and eggplant. The chicken was moist dark meat that differed from other shawarma I tasted because it was more almost nutty tasting and less of that tang taste that some shawarma has. The portion was monstrous as I ate a bunch my husband ate some and I took over 4 oz home. Maybe they just wanted to use up that batch and let it all go on me? I don't know? The eggplant was tasty and tasted like you fried onions with eggplant in a pan. The carrots were skillfully chopped into the tiniest cubes and seemed to taste a bit like coriander but weren't spicy but flavorful. I liked the spicy sauce that came with the plate it wasn't too spicy but was very flavorful and it was long and lingering and interesting.\n\nBoth of us were blown away with the beef kabob. It tasted better than we were expecting so it was a pleasant surprise. It tasted like the juiciest better tasting burger you can imagine. A thin nice sear and very moist lightly packed beef that was very good. My husband said if we ever go back he will try a hamburger from here. The kabob plate came with two sides and my husband picked fries and salad. The Fries were COLD AND SOGGY and might have been leftovers from the large take out order before us. The salad was finely diced tomatoes and cucumbers that they call Israeli Salad but according to Wikipedia Arabs also call this salad Arab Salad and Palestinians call this salad Palestinian Salad so it seems the Mid East is also fighting for bragging rights over this salad.\n\nOur waiter offered us some pita bread with tehini. I have to say time froze and stopped  still for a second when we tasted the pita. It was that good, I don't know how you make a simple pita taste that good but it was. It was fresh warm very light but strong in texture. My husband isn't really crazy about any shawarma from anywhere but even he said the chicken on this pita was delicious.\n\nI took home my left over chicken home and a few sauces and ordered a few felafel's to go. They are green inside and that is an indication of a better felafel that is made with fresh herbs instead of dry. The felafel's didn't have a big crunch but were moist inside and very fresh herby tasting. \n\nOur waiter was very thoughtful and just kept trying to bring me more food.\n\nSome big hits but the fries were a miss. It really was like traveling the world. Limited hours I think open Sunday-Thursday."
0,"I give this place 2 stars for the entertainment.\nThe band was great!  Food was just not very good.  The food server was not attentive at all. This is the second time we have been here and we won't be back.  Sorry Toby,\nmaybe you should actually try the food before you put your name on it!"
1,"Hands down best burger I've ever eaten...I stop here every time I'm in Vegas. Food is fantastic, the Wagyu burger melts in your mouth and I cannot get enough of the pineapple ketchup. Our server, Bobby, was attentive, personable, and gave excellent recommendations....he completed our Bachi experience!"
0,Quite possibly the dullest buffet in Vegas... I'll stick to the Rio and Bellagio.
0,"We flew to Vegas from Portland, OR  to stay at the Cosmo and hear Gareth Emery as a celebration for our 8th wedding anniversary. We bought tickets for Gareth Emery online and stayed at the Cosmo (4 nights). We paid 50.00 for a guys ticket and 20.00 for mine. We are big fans of the DJ and planned our trip around this event. When we got to the club the guy said oh since you are a hotel guest, you get in free. So basically we wasted $70? Nobody told us that before. Anyways we get in and by 12 we werent allowed by security to get on the dance floor and aggressively told that we couldnt stand around but had to keep walking towards outside or another room. I told them that we are there for this dj and they didnt care. They eventually let us on the dance floor and it was dangerous...people pushing...way over the limit. We didnt stay for the entire set and we were so frustrated. There were several crowd control guys with flashlights constantly telling us to keep moving. How about telling the people to move who don't even know who the dj is? Its just not fair that fans of the dj cant even enjoy a show. We are very upset by this experience. We have been to Marquee in the past and heard ATB and others and had similar experiences but by far this was the worst."
1,"This restaurant was friggin fantastic. We went here for dinner and I can honestly say it was in the top 5 best meals I've ever had.\n\nThey bring out several kinds of breads with different olive spreads - so good.\n\nThe service was amazing. They really dote over you and make you feel like royalty.\n\nThe food - exquisite. From the steak to the Lobster Mac N Cheese, we were in heaven.\n\nThe VIEW, OH THE VIEW!!!!! We had a seat right by the window overlooking the fountains...it was heaven. So beautiful. And we stayed for hours, weren't rushed out at all.\n\nCan't wait to go back. Everything was top notch. This restaurant is excellent."
1,"Not to say that I'm a Mexican food expert, but I am from San Diego and have had more tacos than burgers. That being said, I am a big fan of Filibertos and it is on our weekly rotation of restaurants that we frequent. \n\nGreat food,  friendly service and they are open early and stay open late. \n\nWhat's not to love?"
0,Service has been a wee bit slow. Bad luck is table/waitress. Hope the food is better.
1,I've had the pleasure of coming to this establishment since back in the days and it has never disappointed. Some of my favorites have always being the boca burger w a powerlift smoothie that always hits that special spot. Make sure to come by and give this little coffee pub a try because for me is being always a great treat.
1,"Went back to North on Saturday night.  Have not been there for a few years.  I stopped going since the quality of the food did not match the pricing.   It was good but not spectacular.  Atmosphere is always great and full of energy.  \n\nMuch better experience this time around.  We started with the calamari appetizer.  Calamari were tender and tasty, however, there were not enough to my liking and presentation was not very good.  Calamari were in pieces or broken.  At this type of restaurant I would expect nice round calamari rings embedded in the tender arugula served with the calamari.\n\nThe entrees were much better.  I had the braised beef short rib gnocchi with horseradish cream.  Excellent dish.  Very flavorful and gnocchi were al dente.  Beef was melt in your mouth tender. Dish was  definitely on the rich side, but worth it.  My wife decided on the salmon.  Perfectly cooked to her liking.  The creamy farro side was outstanding, almost like a risotto.\n\nService was very good.  Waiter was very busy, but was efficient and attentive."
0,"Frozen yogurt is frozen yogurt, to the layperson.  I doubt you could tell the difference between this place and any other in town in a blind taste taste.  These guys are getting one star for a very simple reason.\n\nI really, really, REALLY hate it when people put their marketing crap on my car while it's in a parking lot.  So you can imagine how irritating it was to come out from the movie theater and find their little 10% off cards tucked into EVERY FREAKING WINDOW of my car.  Six of them.  I'm not completely sure of what the community standards are here in regards to four letter words, so I'm just going to keep thinking them instead of typing them.\n\nGo clean up your parking lot, Swirls.  And hire a sign-flipper or something.  It's way more eco-friendly."
0,"We got into town at lunchtime.  Our room at Caesars wasn't ready so we decided to wait it out by having a light lunch at Central Michel Richard.  Carol W and I were well versed in Michel Richard's cuisine having dined at his Citronelle and Central in Washington D.C. and had previously dined for breakfast at Central Michel Richard and had walked away pleased.  This time...not so much. \n\nWe were joined by our respective families and seated promptly at a large round table in the sunny, airy dining room just off the Caesars' main lobby.  From this point on, our experience spiraled into the ground almost solely due to a series of missteps by our server.   Carol W recounted our difficulty in getting any drinks beyond water in her review.  Let me add that we got up from the table, went to the bar, and asked the bartender if she could make any cocktails regardless if they were on the list or not.  She could.  So, service strike #1.  I can say with 100% certainty that our server lost beer and alcohol sales to our party.  Since we had early evening dinner reservations for later that day, several people in our party asked how big portions were for several items on the menu.  Our server didn't impress us with his knowledge or familiarity with the menu as his estimates on portion size were dramatically off.  Service strike #2.  \n\nI had the plain Goat Cheese Caesar ($18 for Total Rewards members/$19/add chicken $6, filet mignon $13).  It was a nice looking salad, not over-dressed or overly salty, and possessing good flavor.  However, IT WAS A SALAD without a protein on it and $18 was exorbitant for what I received.  While there wasn't a third service strike, the overall experience was hugely disappointing and not one to inspire me to return."

0,"Decent food, but the service is terrible!\n\nWe went to this location on their opening day, there was barely anyone in the restaurant around 11:00 AM, yet it took an hour to receive our food.  When we did finally get the food, there were lipstick prints on my friend's glass (none of us wore lipstick), which was absolutely gross.  The waiter was nonchalant, when he took the time to actually check on us. \n\nWhen we advised the manager of everything that occurred, she apologized and stated that they don't hand wash the glasses.  I've been to a number of restaurants that have dishwashers and I've never had fresh lip prints on my glass.\n\nThe food was average.  The meat was tough and dry, everyone at my table had different cuts of meat and we all experienced the same issue.  The sides were good.  All in all, this location did not compare to the other Lucille's I have eaten at."
0,Wow every time I come here there out of like 3 items always waiting.  And I come here at 1215 1230 prime lunch time.  Ans I don't have lots of time to wait around.    Chow mien out     Orange chicken out.  Really. Wow     But food is good.    But  prepare to wait
0,"I had been going to cloud9 since the beginning of the new management in 2014. I am a loyal customer and have always been pleased with my services, the friendly staff and management. I went in today, to get my acrylic nails removed and have gels put on. As soon as I sat down I informed the nail tech I wanted him to soak my nails instead of attempting to rip the acrylics off (I have done this before and it has been painful and would have rather sat for longer than be in pain. He disregarded what I asked and after he hurt me twice, I firmly said, \""I need you to soak my nails.\"" It took them forever. The man ended up going to the back and  a woman took over.\n\nI ended up getting a pedicure, at the woman's suggestion, while I uncomfortably soaked my nails in a single bowl of acetone. The pedicure was rushed because three walk-ins arrived right after she started the pedicure process and there were only two people working, including the lady that was doing my pedicure. When she went to put on the temporary flip flops, she wiped off some of the paint on my big toe. She painted over it quickly which left a bump of paint on my toe. \n\nAfter my pedicure, she proceeded to take off my nails, I told her I no longer wanted to get the gel manicure because I didn't have time. From then on her whole demeanor changed, she rushed getting my acrylics taken off, didn't file them down (they are completely uneven and there was even hanging nails) and asked me to pay. I told her my displeasure how I have never had an experience like this. I handed her my card as I was telling her, she slid it and I told her This is a service I wouldn't pay for, I could've done this myself. She told me she wouldn't charge my card and cancelled the transaction. I later got a notification of my card being charged $37 (for the nail removal and pedicure). I called Iimmediately. I told her I wanted to speak to the manager (who previously was Trisha; I was speaking to the new manager Kathy), that my card shouldn't have been charged and I want a refund. She responded by saying, \""I don't have money to refund you, I just spent all that time with you.\"" I told her that she charged my card without authorization, and she said \""You come back In and I fix for you.\"" I responded by saying I don't have time to come back in for you to fix it, nor will I come back in and have you mediocrely \""fix\"" my nails which you ruined in the first place. She apologized and said \""Happy New Year\"" as I told her I woll be disputing the charge with my bank. Save yourself the time, don't come here. In 2015 it was wonderful, but the new management has ruined it, not mention they charge cards when they said they wouldn't.  If I could give 0 stars, I would."

Today was no exception! Ordered 2 combos today, baconator with diet coke and spicy chicken with no mayonnaise. I even politely had the them read the order back to make sure it was correct.  I was given a double cheeseburger with regular coke and the spicy chicken had mayonnaise, that coupled with the rude service was my last straw, I will no longer be going here. :-("

The crappy deshevled hostess told us she couldnt sit us until our fourth person got here i was PISSED.  Secondly, get soem REAL PLATES AND SILVERWARE!!  They served a salad on a Styrofoam  plate with plastic silverware REALLY???  It was pathetic and ridiculous.  I ordered the Popcorn chicken which honestly was decent but my chicken was brunt and overcooked..  it came iwth Waffle fries which honestly you could get at  Chik Fil A.  Also they asked what kind of dipping sauces we wanted for our chicken I stated ranch and BBQ we only get one any other sauce its a 75 cents charge!!  If your so desperate to charge for every little thing then why open a restraunt??  The service was bad the food was ok and to be honest"

1,"I tend to romanticize Mexico.  It's a little strange I know, but I always feel that Mexico is one huge hacienda style restaurant on the beach just perfect for day drinking.  This is what El Encanto is to me.  What my preconceived notion of what Mexico should be like.  That may make me a backwards American hill billy but so be it.   \n\nI enjoy El Encanto.  I do not get to make it up there as often as I would like since It is about 5 miles past ridiculously far, but when i am there I am always glad I went.  This is usually the place I take out of town guests from the East Coast or Midwest.  \n\nThe food is good.  I usually get the Queso Guillermo (How does my dictionary recognize Guillermo but not Queso?  That's gotta be fixed.)  It is basically boiling cheese with a few spices and some green onion.  You can add shallots and this beef that appears to be shredded beef that has either been dried or fried, and I strongly recommend that you do.  I have had the lamb, which is ridiculously good, the fish tacos, which are not deep fried as most other places are, and the pork, which is pork and I love pork.  I have yet to have anything there that was not delicious.  \n\nMy main problem with El Encanto happens to be their Margaritas.  You would expect that a great day drinking mexican spot would have great Margaritas right?  Wrong.  Too sweet, pre-made margarita mix.  This is easily remedied by ordering a shot of Don Julio and a Negra Modelo!\n\nAll in all definitely worth going to if you are in the area.  Make sure to laugh when your guest asks the waiter if they have fresh duck or turtle soup on the menu.  They will think they are wildly original and witty."
0,"Used Yelp to locate a place to connect with two friends staying near the airport. Pressed for time and not really familiar with what's in the immediate area, so decided to hook up here. The Doubletree - place has to be good, right?\n\nWrong! This place is an embarrassment to the Doubletree/Hilton brand. It does have the exorbitant pricing you'd expect (when I walked in my buds were waiting and first comment I heard was - you wanna order one of the $5 Ice Tea's? lol). But it is in a state of disrepair and needs a serious facelift. I couldn't justify paying the prices shown on the menu. That coupled with the price we forked out for a few beers had us QUICKLY looking for another  place.\n\nThis was one of those RARE occasions that Yelpers left me hangin..."
1,Legit coffee spot with great staff and a comfy cozy environment. LOVED my A.R.M and the grouchy john
1,It's a Subway like any other.  It's clean and the food is always good.  The cool thing about this is that it's 24 hours.  Also right now they have deal where you can get a 6 inch Cold Cut Combo or Meatball sub for only $2.
0,"My elementary school teacher colleagues and I were eagerly awaiting our end of the year luncheon at Il Cenone.  When we arrived, the restaurant was un-airconditioned (on a hot summer day), and the waiters were sweating.  We were given a hard time when we requested a few extra seats. It felt like the waiters were doing us a favour by serving us.\n\n We ordered our food and had to wait an extremely long time. When the food arrived, it was mediocre at best.  The risotto was bland, and the rest of the food was under-seasoned, and not well portioned.   Water and drinks were slow to arrive.  When the first diner requested her bill, she was rudely told 'this is the last time you'll get individual bills!'.  Puzzled, I expressed  my shock at the waiter's rudeness.  The waiter retorted that he was not rude madame... (thus proving his rudeness).\n\nBills were very slow to arrive. It turned out that the rude waiter was in fact the manager (perhaps the owner)  of the restaurant!\n\nThe mood in the hot and clammy restaurant was unfortunately very misogynistic.  We were a group of 40 female professionals, along with a couple of male colleagues.  Had we been a group of 40 male professionals, this sort of treatment would surely not have occurred.   When I left, the rude server thanked me and told me to have a nice day.  When I told him there was no need to thank me as I did not enjoy my meal and I would not be returning, he followed me on to the street and continued to justify his rude behaviour.  Very unbecoming...an atrociously failed attempt at proper customer service.\n\nOverall, I am not only disappointed, but disgusted by the the experience my colleagues and I had at this restaurant.  40 women could have recommenced this restaurant to friends and family, but instead we will tell them to STAY AWAY!"
0,This place used to be a lot of fun but has recently gotten way too overcrowded! I used to come here with my friends a lot but the past couple weekends has been insane. We went on one of the nights they had wristbands. My friend got the gold one which meant free drinks for her and we got the regular wrist bands - 50% off.. still an amazing deal! It just sucked that they were so packed. It was difficult to order drinks on multiple occasions because there's always so many people at the bars. It's also impossible to walk around because it's so crowded! The dance floor is also hard to move around! The music wasn't always so great though. It was always a mix of 80s-90s hip hop with a couple current hits mixed in. Very strange to dance to but it was still fun. I miss the old days before this place got so popular but I guess that's good for them.

This place has been here forever and I can remember coming here as a kid when you had to keep track of your own score with paper.\n\nArsenal Bowling is in a very cramped space (for a bowling alley) so there's not much space to hang out and enjoy your drink behind your lane.  Srangers are constantly walking through your group and bumping into you.\n\nThe bowling balls are pretty beat up, there's not much selection, and most of the balls don't even have their weight on them.  The food is typical fried bar food and overpriced.  The drinks are very overpriced.  Only one bartender was working so the wait at the bar was terribly long.  We had to keep skipping turns for the people going for drinks becuase it took them so long to get back.\n\nCompared to a fancy bowling alley like Jillian's in Boston, Arsenal is extremely ghettotastic.\n\nThis is really a 1-star kind of place, but I'm giving a 2nd becuase it's a Pittsburgh Classic."
1,"Food was outrageous. Ed, our bar tender, was the most personable and knowledgeable bar tender I've ever had. Drinks were fabulous. Order off the menu or just chat with Ed and he'll make you something special. You must check out this scene!"
1,"I have had several very positive experiences at Wiggles and Wags Pet Resort.  The owners, Tammy and Howard, are so wonderful with our dogs.  Tammy is a wonderful trainer and I call her \""The Dog Whisperer\"" !  She has really helped us with some challenges with our 2 year old Lab.  I have done one-on-one training with her as well as small group training and I would highly recommend Tammy for any training.  \n\nThey also do a great job of taking special care of our pets when we have boarded at Wiggles and Wags.  Again, I would recommend Wiggles and Wags for all of your boarding and training needs."
0,"My son has been going there with his friends and though its different times of the day, he has been finding hair in his food. That's fucking disgusting. I hope this place goes out of business.\n\nMy family will never eat there again."
0,I think their hours are wrong they dont have them displayed outside like every other buisness... every single time I stop by here on my way to work it's closed... i work at 5: 45am they should be open by 530
1,"We were pleased to find a Thai Restaurant in Surprise. We lived in Seattle before retiring to Arizona and have eaten at many Thai Restaurants there. Tom Yum is right up there with the best. Tom Yum soup is the best. Have been there 4 times in the last two weeks and have tried almost everything they have on the menu and all has been very good. Only reason they don't get a 5 is the service and ordering of food needs a little tweaking, which they must fix or no matter how good the food is they will lose customers."
0,"Well, we were trying to find \""cheese dip\"" in Vegas.  Some kind of Tex-Mex.  We found it.  Let me tell you, that was the best thing about this place.  The cheese dip was actually pretty good and a very ample serving.  Chips were thin, crispy and not too salty.  We really liked it until the entrees came.  Ugh!!  Pork tamales tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in them.  Pork taco was cold and pretty light on the meat.  The cheese enchiladas were, um, cheesy.  That's about it.  Not much taste at all.  Refried beans were smoky and not horrible.  But the rice, was the worst Mexican/Spanish rice I have ever put in my mouth.  Terrible!!  The only reason this place doesn't get one star is because our server, Boone, was awesome.  It's not his fault the food stank.  I would not go there again, unless I was just wanting cheese dip and no entrees.  If you're looking for Mexican OR Tex-Mex, you can do a LOT better."
1,"I've been an Aladdin's fan for years.  All of their locations are fantastic.  For seating, I guess I would prefer the Mt Lebo location, but Squirrel Hill has a lot more space. \n\nI got the baba falafel rolled with a side salad.  The side salad was much larger than I remember and had the cucumber-tomato salad on it as well with feta.  It was a very good salad for very little money ($2.25).  The pita was perfect with crunchy pickled vegetables and crispy falafel balls.  The baba is nicely smoky.  \n\nThe only thing that caused the 4 instead of 5 stars was the rasberry sunshine smoothie.  It was lacking a bit in taste which is surprising when it was definitely full of flavorful items."
1,"We have been here a few times and each time was a pleasant experience. Now, we've never been through the drive through which apparently catches hella flack on here lol but the service inside isn't bad. The place is clean. Bathrooms were clean. This is always a wash you're hands after type of meal. Out of all the fast food chicken joints Popeye's is the best imo especially their red beans & rice and their tea. I also like their biscuits and the fact that the food is always hot."
0,"Complete crap!! Will never rent from Fox again. The car was so dinged up that even the employees said it really should be pulled from service. The car had a hard time on the freeway - complete clunker! Had to ride two shuttle buses, first to car rental center then next to Fox, not worth the minor savings for the extra ride and clunker."
1,"I took my hubby here for his birthday together with our two kids. Husband is Japanese (born and raised in Japan) and really enjoys authentic Japanese food, which is overall very hard to find in the US.\n\nBased on the yelp reviews I decided to give this a try. Called for a reservation pretty late and was given the table by the door. Maybe not the best table in the restaurant, but we really wanted to do so we decided to take it. Upon arriving, we were given another table as another customer had cancelled. Great!\n\nNow the food; we ordered several dishes and all were really spectacular. Some that stood out were:\n\n- Fried homemade Tofo  ...  this is THE BEST tofu and stock I have ever tasted. All is homemade, the tofu, dashi soup, etc ... no MSG's used which is so nice and the flavors are so well balanced and mild.\n- Kobe beef tendon ... just think about butter melting in your mouth ... so tender and juicy ... the best of the best.\n- Foie gras flavored egg custard ... a little different from what you would find in Japan, but again the flavors were so well balanced.\n\nYou will notice that you will eat less of this food as the flavors are so satisfying and the food takes some time to come out as ALL is made fresh. We spend about $100 for two adults and two children. Well worth the money!\n\nOverall an incredible experience at a very reasonable price and well worth a five star! Will sure to go back when visiting Vegas in the future and would definitely recommend this to everyone who really enjoys top quality authentic homemade Japanese food."
1,"Conveniently located a few minutes from Midwestern campus, this is my go-to grocery store when I'm not picking up random snacks at Trader Joe's or bulk items at Costco. The store is clean usually well stocked. Prices are a lot cheaper than a Vons and the lighting is much better than Fry's. The workers are friendly and helpful and will walk you to the aisle for the item you're looking for. There usually aren't any ridiculously long lines and you don't need a club card to get their special deals! I definitely will be continuing to shop here!"
0,a horrible place to take your dog.attendant not at all helpful.we have bad backs so this the worst place have to complain to attendant so she can bring ramp over to get dog into the tub.then shampoo and conditioner watered down.[3 days later both dogs smelled] what a waist of time and money!!then dryers have to pick your dogs up to and then down when finished hard on your backs and a real workout to clean and dry your dogs to last 2 or 3 days!! this was the worst place to go and will never go back.last place took dogs to they both smelled good for 3 weeks.
0,This particular location was terrible. Half of the menu did not exist and they stopped serving sushi. We walked out. The other location is awesome.
0,This place serves extremely oily appetizers that are extremely salty. Not a fan. They have ipad menus for self ordering which is becoming a standard at all you can eat sushi places these days.
1,"It's Tropical Smoothie, so the product is great and the prices are exactly what you expect.\n\nHelpful, friendly staff too!\nThis location is set up kinda odd. This is not a lot of room to move around.\nAlso, they have signs prominently displayed to address their VIP Card and Military Discount programs... so DON'T F Around!!!"
0,"Just an FYI for those who might have purchased a Amazonlocal coupon for this dump...I ordered my food to take out and was about to pay the difference when the guy taking my order said they do not take the coupon. He was mumbling something about letting people know. OK, so now I paid $10 and i cannot get what I was promised, so he had some other guy who walked in, who apparently worked there, call the owner.  Well, same story...they will not accept the coupon. From what he said, Amazonlocal was not depositing whatever percentages they owed from the promotional sales. Luckily, I was able to get a refund from Amazonlocal.  Those who have purchased a voucher for this place, don't even bother to order, just get a refund! Also, they call themselves \""President's Pizza\"", as well....I have seen another Amazonlocal voucher for this place as well but never purchased it (Thank Goodness!)  Get your refund!!!! By the way, for all you die hards, perhaps the food is decent, which is why, to be fair i have not rated it, but most of the salad items are not even available....Hmmm...False advertising on both counts, here?!?"
1,"Not a big fan of pizza but this place is super yummy. The first time I came in with my family I was kind of confused how to order. The set up is kind of weird & the employee behind the counter was like \""it's like ordering at Subway\"". Didnt really help much since my parents have never been to Subway. Anyways, we finally ordered the Margherita pizza with mushrooms, spinach & Italian sausage. Tasted great!"
1,I can always count on a good piece of meat every time I visit Las Vegas from Gallaher's ( and a very fine extensive wine selection to bless said cow tastiness )
0,Very disappointed with the bar next to the sports book! Trying to watch the Dodger game and the bartender is telling me that other games have priority! Really?! Hockey and lacrosse? The game is nowhere to be seen on any TV and I placed my bet here and was hoping to watch the game. Totally ridiculous! There are multiple baseball games being shown and the bartender is telling me there is only one baseball game being shown. I'm staying here and my boyfriend and I have been gambling and spending money here. Very disappointed!
1,Fusion sushi done right! \n\nI enjoyed the quality of service and food. \n\nThe sushi was fresh and tasty. \n\nThank you for the memorable experience!!!
0,"I came here for restaurant week and I've never had such a terrible dining experience before. The food and service here deserves 0 stars, however, the restaurant's decor is elegant.\n\nI ordered a blackberry salad for my appetizer and it was awful. The salad consisted of a few pieces of raw and undressed spinach, four blackberries, and sloppy hand shredded ham. \n\nMy stuffed sole over pasta was disappointing. You can't call yourselves an italian restaurant when you overcook your pasta to the point of no return. There was no seasoning at all on the food (which would explain the salt and pepper shakers on the table). The fish was overcooked.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered a steak with stuffed shrimp. They gave him two mere pieces of shrimp and the supposed \""crabmeat\"" stuffing was mainly breading. The funniest part was the sauce they decided to put on the plate. They served the steak with a huge portion of sauce in a little dish which tasted like mustard straight from the squeeze bottle. Why is that supposed to be there again? Had one poured that all over the steak, one's palate would be drowned in horseradish. \n\nDessert was mediocre. My almond cake tasted like a defrosted pound cake with reddiwhip on the side. \n\nYou've been warned. Olive Garden may be a better pick."
1,First got this pizza when they ordered at work. I really like it. On the greasy side for sure but good cheese pizza. Semi new york style. Not flat enough for that but it is good pizza. Pepperoni one is way too greasy though pizza looks orange
1,Nice place. Pretty clean for being in a casino. Prices are a little high but no surprise there. Customer service was great. Very friendly staff.
0,"Employees here are great, location is great.\n\nDon't pick the white marble table in the corner(on the right when you walk in) it's broken and wobbles a lot.\n\nInternet speed is horrible, speedtest.net got 1mbps/0.32 mpbs"
0,"Average corporate airport hotel, operates on the hostage model. They are aware that most guests are trapped at the airport and over price the services accordingly. The restaurant is below average quality at very high prices, slow, plan at least an hour and a half for a lackluster dinner. Pretty sure this is where the TV show, The Walking Dead, recruits for extras."
1,"I've been to several Oreganos over the last few years.  Since I live close to this one, it's become my go-to pizza place.  Every time I've gone, service has been excellent.  I usually get take out since waits on busy nights can be over an hour.  Parking can also be a pain.  The thin crust specialty pizzas they have are a tad salty but delicious.  The pan pizza also is quite good, although I wished they have the specialty pizzas offered for both thin and pan style crust.  Oreganos has also been the only place I've found in Phoenix that serves THE Chicago deep dish pizza-the one that's several inches thick from the cheese and other yummy fillings.  Not even the Unos on Mill had that.  It takes a bit longer, but totally worth it!  Portions are generous.  Good food & value."
1,"I love this place. It's so laid back, GREAT beers, cool crowd. No yuppies (that I could tell). Hard to find in Charlotte."
1,We had never tried a Hungry Howies until moving to the area recently.  We like deep dish pizza.. We are now fans of this place!! Its not a gourmet sit down pizza place but its pretty darn good for fast food pizza and they deliver. We like the pan pizza with butter cheese crust flavor or the garlic flavor! The cheese bread is good also! Staff was good to us! They messed up our delivery order one time and I called and they took care of our next order! Thats service I like and appreciate! We will return!!
1,"Went back again for dinner on Saturday night during prime time. The place was packed and I thought we were going to be in for a huge wait, however, we were sat immediately and service was faster than expected for how busy the place was. Food was great, even better than the first time so we enjoyed it even more.\n\nThis is our new favorite Mexican food place."
1,"I really liked this food. I'm not Indian, but my boyfriend is. He liked it too! \n\nWe stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered from the menu instead of the buffet. We ordered the chili chicken, chicken 65, lamb biryani, Lamb vindaloo, and tadka dal. It was delicious. The chicken 65 wasn't spicy or flavorful enough, but everything else was incredible. We spiced everything at. 7/10. It had a bite, but wasn't too hot. \n\nErythema was freshly made. There were only two other families in the restaurant when we were there, both Indian/Pakistani? \n\nService was slow and grumpy. But it was totally worth it. It's hard to find good Indian food in Pittsburgh. Udipi is ok for pure veg... Corriander is greasy... India gardens dishes all taste the same... \n\nI would return. \n\nPortions were small, but I like that because then you can order more things to taste! Although, prices were relatively high. Every entree was about $12 and were ordered 4. It was worth it regardless."
1,"My family and I really enjoyed our first visit to Bahama Breeze. I have been meaning to try it for some time. We went in on a Saturday afternoon and they were not too busy. The food was pretty good, but the best part of the visit was the staff. When we first walked in, one of the servers walked up to my kids who were looking and the fountain and pulled two pennies out of his own pocket for them to throw into the fountain. When we were first sat it took a couple minutes for our waiter to come to the table and two of the other servers (who had just gotten off) noticed and without us having to ask went and found our server. Our server was also very friendly and did a great job. My family and I will definitely be returning to this restaurant in the future."
0,"Wife and I visited here two days ago.  We waited an hour for our sandwich which was not properly cooked (steak sandwich with the meat barely cooked and bloody).  Our desert arrived an hour late.  When we talked to the manager, he just smirked \""the was not even cooked huh\"" after seeing the bloody mess on our table.  No apology.  What a disappointment for an anniversary dinner.  Never going back!"
1,"My wife and I saw this show Nov 2013 and we really enjoyed it. The MC is the guy with the Birds from Americas Got Talent and he is okay as the host. The acts are kind of short but they are good. I would recommend it and it is good for families. I wish the magic was a little longer, but what we saw was fantastic. VIP tickets are not needed because the theater is not that big so views are okay anywhere pretty much."
1,"Wonderful box. Staff was great, class was a lot of fun, and members were really friendly!"
1,"YUM! YUM! YUM!! Cornish Pasty is an awesome place!!! Most of the seating is large community tables and there is a very warm, welcoming vibe to the whole place!! They have a great selection of beers and the food was AMAZING!!! Very authentic and so delicious!! \n\nThis will definitely become a MUST GO place for me anytime I visit AZ!!!"
1,"We decided to stop in during a recent trip to Vegas after seeing the dinner in the show Hungry Investors. I must admit, the food was amazing and just as the show highlighted the service was slow. This lil dinner could easily be 5 stars if they had better service. I had the prime Benedict and the wide had the traditional, both were absolutely amazing. Even with the chaotic service I still have to admit this was a great stop."
1,Great Restaurant! Large Portions and good food.
1,"Very good. Got the stir fried beef tongue, deep fried garlic, whole squid and some sushi rolls. All were very yummy! We will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas! Until next time ichiza!"
0,"WARNING ,,,,, this place is for SUCKERS ONLY ..... funky smelling ,worse tasting seafood ... overpriced ..... raunchy,un-clean restrooms .... only reason anyone goes here is because this is a ''tourist trap '' type neighborhood with some fun shopping spots nearby and this restaurant is positioned in the center of everything. As P.T. Barnum once said  '' There's a sucker born every minute '' ...... stay away ... any other restaurant will be better ."
0,Disappointed..polish already peeling and it's only been a couple of days :(
1,"The Common Market is an excellent little deli, bar, and quick grocer in SouthEnd Charlotte.  \n\nIf you are looking to pick up a quick bottle of wine, a fresh sandwich, or just something basic, this is one of the best drop-ins in the SouthEnd area.  I absolutely love this place!"
0,My girlfriend spoke big about this place. Once I got there and ate the entire meal I came to the conclusion that the chicken shack aka chicken bonz is better. She also stated that there was a different cook last time she went and it was better. This time around it was a short hispanic lady that made it. The fries weren't crispy. They were actually soggy and hot. the wings were something that I could have made at home but 10x better. The best thing was the orange crush pop. \n\nOverall I would prefer to make the drive to the sunset  chicken shack because after reading the review for the shack on maryland. I won't be going there either. I would be willin to try this place again if its a differnt cook.
0,Sushi is pretty good but prices are outrageous. I bought two drinks and two rolls for happy hour and two rolls after and the bill was over $60.
1,"Solid 4 stars bordering on 5.  This place is a legit, old school steakhouse.  No frills; just solid drinks, steaks and food.\n\nWent with a group of 5 and for entrees we all split two massive bone in fillets, one massive rib eye, and one order of lamb chops.  All meat was cooked to perfection, was buttery soft and tasted awesome.  The lamb chops were my favorite.  Just the right amount of salt.  We ate everything.  Standard steak house sides of spinach, asparagus, french fries and mushrooms were all delicious, but could have come in a bit bigger portions for sharing.  Appetizers of caesar salad, chopped salad, shrimp cocktail,  and caprese salad were enjoyed.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  The cocktail sauce with the shrimp could have used a bit more zing--some more horseradish possibly.  \n\nService was excellent.  No complaints.  Prices on par with top tier steakhouses.  Complimentary pickles and cole slaw were consumed and replenished numerous times.  Best meal we had in Montreal. Overall, everyone was pleased.  I would definitely return."
0,"Yeah, maybe I'm too spoiled. It was good and fresh, and clean, but I want even my local taquerias to have some character and some sort of ambiance, even if it's divy. The food wasn't amazing, but I'd eat here in a pinch, without a complaint. Maybe a whine, pretentious and mewling, but not a full on complaint. \n\nYelp in LV isn't like in the bay area or the northwest. Peops are so happy to not be lambasted and bombarded by the commercialization around the strip, that anything prepared by actual people instead of employees filling a role seems amazing. My first inclination was that this was a great find - a cheap 4 star joint. Upon returning home though, I realized that this place wouldn't really work if there was anything better around. \n\nLas Vegas has cool people living there - so friendly! So earnest! -  they deserve cool spots that are local, delicious, and inspired."
0,"I have been a member here for 8 years....\nSince I am still a member you would think the place is great or I would have left????\nI have no idea why I am still here..........\nThe other reviews are spot on!\nCrowded... no matter what time you go! \nParking lot is a f*ing joke... my car has been hit, and my door dinged by rude inconsiderate idiots who's cars are dirty pieces of crap.\nPeople just stare at you and gawk the whole time... most have no real concern for working out and getting in shape.\nLocker room is ridiculous...... women naked... sitting... just hanging out... bare ass on the bench blocking your ability to get to the lockers.\nI think medicare pays for half of the memberships here.\nThis place was a lot more upscale when they opened.....it is definitely the Wal-Mart of workout clubs!\nLooking for a new place to work out!"
1,"I was expecting a complete geek-fest, I must admit. I was expecting to get harassed by medieval dorks and that sort of thing. But, I was wrong. This was thoroughly enjoyable. Buy tickets at Fry's before you go and gas up because it's quite a drive with only one city between Tucson & Apache Junction. Parking was easy. I was surprised to see actual structures making up this little town of vendors, stages & game booths. There were performers, fun and delicious food at reasonable prices and cute little shops everywhere you turned. The rides were so hilarious and ingenious. Many were powered by the riders (great for wearing the kids out) or else there were operators to hand power them and there were even elephant rides. The people visiting the fair were as diverse & delightful as the fair itself. I would love to go again and would highly recommend this fest to anyone looking to get some kicks in before the summer heat sets in! OMG-VISIT THE TOMATO THROWING INSULT BOOTH (VEGETABLE JUSTICE)!!!! IT'S A RIOT!!!!!!"
1,"Overall we had a great time.  If you're just going there to shovel food in your face you will be disappointed. We took relaxed approach and tried a little here and a little there, took in some fun cooking demonstrations and sipped a couple cold ones.  It was a beautiful day and got to meet and chat with some really cool people and talk about food.  Not a bad way to spend an afternoon!"
1,"Oh man, the burgers here are better than In-and-Out. They must cook the meat patties in extra doses of love or something because it didn't take me long at all to wolf down mine.\n\nI ordered the guacamole burger with everything on it, along with their seasoned steak fries. Typical fries, delicious burger. I also ordered the Caesar salad, which was the usual fare. The lettuce was super fresh and crisp, which won me over. The plate wasn't drowned in dressing, either,  which was a relief. \n\nMy aunt ordered the beef mix, which came with tortillas, rice and beans. These beans had substance! I was very pleased to see that they were the perfect balance of solids and liquids. They weren't soup; nor were they a paste. The beef was very Hispanic in its flavors: spicy, salty, aromatic. \n\nI recommend this place wholeheartedly if you find yourself in the neighborhood."
0,"Walmart Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Every single employee here freaked me out this weekend. I am sure it doesn't help I had just left Heaven otherwise known as In N Out Burger, but still. Do they get their fucking employees in The Twilight Zone? \n\nWe walk in through the garden center and are instantly greeted by a smiling employee hosing the plants. She earned the star for the store. Good job. Next we browse the plants, pots, etc. The plants were very poor quality and half dead. We venture inside and that's when it gets ugly. Our entire mission was to see their selection of outdoor rugs. During the summer in Vegas most stores do carry them since we all spend more time outside in the sun, by pools, BBQing, etc. This was my first visit to this specific location so I had no clue where the desired rug section may be. I look for a friendly face in a green shirt to assist me as I'm walking in circles. 3 people in odd colored green shirts quickly walk pass me with empty, zombie like expressions on their faces. Almost as if they are walking into the light and I don't exist. OK..... I decided I was going to keeping looking without asking for help. Then my partner in crime got brave and approached one of the Walmart zombies and asked where the rugs are. The zombie says,\""Well, you're on your way\"". Huh? WTF kind of answer is that?! Since we were seriously wondering in circles we didn't know which was the right way. Then I inquired about outdoor rugs. The zombie looked at me as if it was a trick question. \""Do you mean doormats? Indoor and outdoor rugs are the same.\"" At this point I was livid and could not respond. My friend said thank you and shuffled me away before I slapped a ho. Since the outdoor rug was a fail we then made a half ass attempt to find big, Hefty trash bags with zero success. Both of us gave up and ditched our cart of random water noodles, pots, etc. \n\nWhat's even more upsetting is before I started writing this review I googled patio rugs and low and behold Walmart actually does have a HUGE selection of outdoor rugs!!!! Now if only your employees knew this....."
0,"God, I am so irritated it's not even worth the energy and time to get all pissed off again telling you why I will probably never come back here.  Maybe if I was younger again and coudl deal with it - or if i was from somewhere where what they offer at Tao is \""new\"" or \""interesting\"".  \n\nThe waiter was an A-HOLE big time.  Before we ordered he YELLED AT US that he REFUSED TO DELIVER ANY FOOD UNTIL THE MENUS WERE ALL REMOVED FROM THE TABLE - basiclaly that means we can't get appetizers and order more later...Jerk?  Seriously?\n\nSecond of all, the food tastes like either Panda F**king Express (all noodle dishes) or it's completely covered in Sesame Oil.  Don't get me wrong - I LOVES me some sesame oil - but not when you can't taste what is is cooked with?\n\nFinally, I think our bill was like $700, probably because we had 8 heavy drinkers there.  But it really felt like a rip - I paid $70 for drinks, one egg roll, and a bite of some Mall court noodles. \n\nno thanks!  Denny's is across the street and at least there you know what you're going to get."
0,Today is 9/22/13.  Bought a USS Carl Flagg for $2k.  To date no one has contacted me about when i can expect my purchase to arrive.  I bought this for my son in-person on 9/6/13.  A complete lack of customer service from this company.
0,"Somewhat disappointed, given prior reviews. We were in town for a conference and came here for a group meal. The restaurant is part if the Westin. While I appreciated the farm to table concept, the execution fell short. Several of us ordered the beet salad. While it was tasty, the presentation was poor--somewhat monochromatic. One person had mostly greens with only two or three small chunks of beet, and mine had absolutely no goat cheese. When I brought this to the attention of the server, he had to check there was supposed to be cheese in it before bringing me a small cup of goat cheese.\n\nSeveral of us also ordered the seafood stew. Not only was the broth extremely tasteless, the odor was very fishy, to the point that non-seafood eaters at the table were offended by it. The small chunks of crabmeat were overdone.\n\nOverall, I was not very impressed and would probably not return next time I'm in town."
0,"One of these days I will learn NOT to take out of town guests to places I haven't tried first.  \n\nI was pretty excited for one of my favorite people to come and visit.  Her only request?  Sushi!  While I have my list of absolute AZ favorites (Tokyo Lobby, Toyama, Sakana, Hiro, Dozo) foolishly I decided we should try somewhere new.  Having read many good things about Hana, the choice was made.\n\nWalking into the BYOB place with our Kirin Ichiban in hand, we were ready for a great evening.  Too bad that isn't what we experienced.  After being ignored for a few minutes by everyone who passed by and even the person behind the counter, I found someone to tell that there were two of us and we would like to sit at the sushi bar.  Although there were spots open, we were left standing there for quite a while.  Do you want to stand around holding a 6-pack and not even be offered a bottle opener?  Me neither.  Once we were finally seated, we weren't told about any specials, offered water or even glasses for our beer.  \n\nDeciding to make the best of it, we ordered:\nYellowtail sashimi (good, the best item we had)\nSpicy scallop nigiri (good)\nAlbacore sashimi (dry, not sliced through, leaving us top pick off overcooked bits and pieces)\nFreshwater eel nigiri (dry and crumbly rice, falling apart at the touch)\nScallop dynamite ($15+ for 'krab'?  Really?)\n\nThe female sushi chef was nice but our waitress was nonexistent.  Other tables and customers at the sushi bar seemed to be getting decent service (water, getting their beer/wine/whatever from the refrigerator) but we were left without water refills (once we finally got any at all) and don't even think about getting another of those BYOB beers we brought.  It even took a while to get the unused bottles back when we were trying to leave. \n\nLackluster food and nonexistent service at a premium price.  No thanks."
0,"I had high hopes for NOLA.\n\nMy boyfriend's family lives in New Orleans, and we visit yearly.  When I first walked into NOLA, my first impression was that this is kind of like the Disney World version of New Orleans.  It is over the top, cliche, and kinda cheesy.  That's fine, I can deal with that.  Cheesy can be fun, and the music was great.  I tried to keep a positive attitude.\n\nI ordered a Sazerac, a classic New Orleans cocktail, and it was served warm.  It was also very heavy on the absinthe rinse.  Friends have told me they've had great Sazeracs at NOLA, so I'm hoping this was a fluke.\n\nNext, I tried the alligator appetizer.  It was pretty tasty, but the presentation was not great.  The tiny nuggets of fried alligator were dwarfed by the huge rectangular plate they were served on.  It just seemed like an interesting choice. The red beans and rice dish was pretty awesome, but it wasn't as good as those I've had on the Gulf Coast.  They weren't as thick and creamy, and they were lacking in spice (a bottle of hot sauce fixed that).  Overall, NOLA did not do justice to the awesomeness that is New Orleans cuisine.  \n\nI love New Orleans, and I want to love NOLA.  I'll definitely give it a second try.\n\nSome perks:  live music, $5 valet parking after 5 (for all of Market Square), good service, fun ambiance"
1,"When I went to grad school in Chambana, Seabpat was an excellent stop for fried fish. To be honest, when I got my take out order, I was slightly taken aback by the anti-theft camera which took a still every 30 seconds. OK. That's the price you pay for deliciousness. They've since moved closer to campus on Kirby, and I'm sure you get the heart stopping goodness that you used to get in the hood."
0,"To celebrate the end of institute, and leaving Phoenix, my collaborate work group decided to have a celebratory dinner. There were 9 of us in all, and so it was suggested that we come here. Cool, whatever, brewery. \n\nFirst of all, the service was extremely helpful and attentive. From the beginning, our main server asked us how we would break down the check, and if it were possible to consolidate credit cards among us so we'd be able to get out faster. She was very polite and ready to accommodate, even though she was training someone new at the same time. \n\n When we arrived, someone immediately took our drink orders. Most of us started with cocktails, and 2 people got beers--big mistake on the majority. The Manhattan and Tom Collins my friends got were extremely watered down, with very little alcohol, and my SF lemonade tasted like lemonade. Only. Apparently the beers, though, were very good, and the next round, that's what everyone ordered. \n\nAs a group we decided to split appetizers: A chef's platter (with Southwest Chicken Eggrolls, barbecue buffalo wings, and potstickers), and 2 baskets of garlic fries. We were all starving after our last day teaching so we dove in as soon as the food arrived. The buffalo wings were sweet and barely spicy at all, although the chicken had a nice crispness to it. The Southwestern eggrolls were bland, so I dipped them in ranch, and the garlic fries were very greasy--the garlic was minced and spread over the fries, so there wasn't much flavor and since it was raw minced, somewhat intense.\n\nAt this point, we were starting to get full, when our entrees actually arrived. I tried: \n\nBeer battered fish and chips - The fish was NOT beer battered. It was breaded. Your generic whitefish, a texture as if fried after freezing, but drier than usual because of the breading. It was served with a mound of those same garlic fries and a \""Cajun roumalade\""--basic, orange tarter sauce that just tasted like tarter. I had to add a lot of vinegar and Tabasco to make this taste like anything.\n\nMarzen bacon burger - I had a bite of my friend's burger and it was pretty good: nicely charred meat, crisp bacon. I like my meat a little rare, though, and the burger was well-done all the way through, and a little tougher than my preference. \n\nSteak sandwich (don't know the actual name) - Another friend had a steak sandwich, which was a steak cooked medium rare with caramelized onions, a garlic alioli (or so she said, I couldn't taste it), gorgonzola, and arugula on a French roll, and the same ubiquitous garlic fries. The steak was pretty tasty and the sharp gorgonzola complemented it well. I could barely taste the arugula, however, and was in fact convinced it was actually spinach. \n\nOther people all had about the same to say about their food. It was too much and kind of bland. The portions of the food were pretty ridiculous. I know its a brewery but the plate was twice the size of my head. \n\nFor a watery cocktail and mediocre food, I paid about 26 bucks, which to me is just too much for something I'm unsatisfied with. 1 star for the service, 1 star for the ambience, which was pretty conducive to a group dinner (even with the Nascar racing on the flatscreens poised all about us). No stars for the drinks, the food, and the price."
0,"Waste of time, jumping into the Ohio river with your mouth open in search of your own catch like a Pelican would have been a better option. This place is nothing but another chain with mediocre food and spoiled college kids working tables. \n\nThe crab was over cooked, the fried fish was soggy and deep brown. It was 6pm when do they change their oil? For the overall quality you are given the value is 2x what you should be paying. It's on par with Red Lobster, the only difference is they shove everything in a pale. My 4 yr old like that...If I was that Pelican I would have flown away if I knew better.  That was the first and last time for us at Joes. \n\n\nScore\nFood Quality 2\nService 2\nAtmosphere 4 ( it's Pittsburgh how can you score bad!)\nValue 1 \nRecommend 1"
0,"Came here to eat after a comedy show there at the Riviera. Let me just start by saying the only reason this place gets 2 stars from me is because our waiter Joab, he was very friendly and accommodating. He is only the second waiter ever to shake hands and introduce himself to the guy at the table. Now moving on to the rest of my review. I did my usual check in with yelp when we got to the restaurant, and to my surprise I got a check in offer! Free order of spring rolls with a purchase of an entree. Perfect! So I show our waiter and he said that the last time he asked the manager about this offer she refused to honor it. When businesses decide to do check in offers you would think they would be excited to honor it knowing that this is a review website. All managers and staff should be knowledgeable about any and all offers that their guest bring to the table. \nThe next point I want to make is that we ordered steak medium well and it came out well done. Last but not least I want to mention that the price is too expensive for the poor quality of food you get. I would have enjoyed going to Denny's more."
0,"Hubby insisted we had eaten here before. I thought not. I was partly right, as we have eaten at the Good Egg before, and not been very pleased. Hubby had hated their crepe-eggs. We didn't know the connection between the two restaurants before we sat down.\n\nStarving, I order their farmhouse eggs benedict and Hubby orders their breakfast quesadilla and an Oreo pancake (he just HAD to try it). We both get iced tea and it tastes funny, like it was made with bad tap water. When the food arrives, Hubby inhales his quesadilla, but says nothing about its quality. The Oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table. I gingerly attempt to scrape off the runny, nasty substance they are passing off as country gravy. The only thing that is prepared close to well in my meal are the poached eggs. The turkey sausage is gross and the bacon is somehow not right- it's not crispy and the taste is off. The biscuits taste like they are from a mix. To top it off, the server places a mostly empty pitcher of water that is no longer ice water on our table. Nice. Can you at least pretend you didn't just give me the leftover water from someone else's table? Our server never returns to fill our tea (except when dropping off the check), or even to see how things are. Maybe he knows better than to ask."
0,"Cabo is fubar. My experience there was fubar. \n\nWe went on an employee appreciation night, so it was pretty packed. \n\nIn the beginning, I thought our server was crappy and I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt since it was employee appreciation night. I thought maybe she was just getting crappy customers and crappy tips all night long. By the end of the night, I was just convinced that she was a crappy server. \n\nWhen we got to our table, it smelled vaguely of vomit (I'm not sayin' someone vomited there ... it just smelled like someone vomited there), there was a huge puddle of something on the ground beneath the table, and my chair was sticky. We asked the hostess if we could get the puddle mopped up. They very politely obliged. \n\nAfter we got seated, our server came by to take our drink order. After that, there were unacceptably long intervals between her visits. \n\nThe food was really bad, not seasoned well, hardly Mexican. Maybe Mexican inspired. For the food and service we got, we should have been paying Del Taco prices. \n\nIf you order a double size of any margarita, you get to keep the glass. Classy. \n\n* off the strip"
0,Stopped by today to get a few things for work and it's no longer there..... I'm not sure on if it moved or went outta business. I hope it just moved.
0,"Tried this place because I had a groupon and I'm a huge fan of sushi. The service was excellent but the food, not so much. Sushi didn't seem fresh. Maybe they use frozen fish? The rolls definitely weren't made well and kept falling apart as I would try to pick it up. I then ordered the teriyaki chicken as the sushi was almost inedible. The fried rice was the best part of this dish. Either the teriyaki sauce had zero flavor or they forgot to put it on there. The dish was filled mostly with carrots and broccoli with little meat. Definitely not worth the price. Good thing I had a groupon. Won't be back again."
0,"Plan to wait in line for nothing....An utter hovel of a joint frequented by \""Daddy's money\"" GAY-SU students and skanks in overpriced dresses from the \""Chinese Store\""...These hoochies have been known to be seen on the Discovery channel special about evolution. The bar actually lets them get up there, smearing they shoes on the bar to spin this wheel so they can get even more intoxicated...You may see one girl that looks somewhat classy, but guaranteed in less than 15 minutes time, she will be the epitome of a bona fide slut, due to her ghastly appearance and freakishly grotesque display of makeup and chonch hair as she dances carelessly upon the bar. The floors are a sticky mess, there are stairs in all the wrong places, the DJ is alright but the lighting is crap.....the bartenders are jerks, overpriced drinks...but if you are looking to run a train on someone this is the ideal spot....."
1,The Cobb salad was really good. Loved the balsamic dressing. Ask for Daryl. Best waiter ever because he used to be a butler!!! He is finishing law school. Nice man.
0,"I really hate giving bad reviews but here it goes!\n\nThis was a place that I used to go to for the first few months that I moved to Vegas. The first couple times were a good experience. It's close to my house, the people servicing me were really nice and sweet but I did stop going here...\n\nMy pet peeve when I go to any type of spa is when the person servicing me, does what they think is best and not what I request. \n\nWell, the reason why I stopped going here was because I had asked the manicurist, who wasn't the regular person that did my nails, to not make my acrylics too thick because I don't like my nails looks like they're about to explode, they look so unnatural. She says to me \""No, too thin no good! Thicker is better.\"" I hated my nails but I didn't want to be rude and spend another couple hours getting them redone. When it came time to remove the acrylics, I didn't go back there, I went across the street and the ladies there were in awe as to how thick the Oasis manicurist made my nails. They were so thick that the manicurist had a difficult time removing them. She shaved them down, tried prying them off... IT TOOK FOREVER!!! And worse part was that I started bleeding because my nails are naturally very thin and due to the thickness of the nails and the length of time that I was sitting there getting my nails removed, my nails practically ripped off and bled. EW, never again."
1,"Came here during the wine walk. I'm not exactly sure when it opened, but I know it must've been recently. \n\nThe crew members are very friendly and knowledgeable. The menu has a lot of items ranging from white choco mocha, caramel apple cider, mocha coconut frappe, lattes, and smoothies. I ended up just getting a refreshing iced tea (it seems like that's all I've been getting at coffee shops lately). I wanted a frappe, but I didn't feel like spending $3.95 on a small that was going to melt the second I walked out the doors. I took a seat and enjoyed their free wifi for about 20 minutes, before they closed at 8pm :/\n\nEven though I was only there for 20 minutes, I already knew I liked it. The shop is very spacious, there are a lot of tables, and the internet is fast! I also noticed they have a lot of pastries and even parfaits. I liked that there weren't many people there because it made for a calm ambiance. Next time I come, I'll definitely try their coffee. The aroma was pretty sexy..."
1,"This show was AMAZING!\n\nNot only was the show itself outstanding, but the sound and special affects are what did me in.\n\nNot only did it have incredibly sound technology, but EACH individual seat had little speakers in the headrests to make your experience that much greater.\n\nWhen the show was over, I couldn't help but feel completely in awe.\nIf you're a Beatles fan, this is a definite must-do."

1,"While I am all for having healthy and affordable lunch options Downtown I am not a pita person and thusly my attitude towards the Pita Pit is I could really take it our leave it. Why would a person who doesn't like Pitas go to a Pita pit, that remains a good question??? \n\nThe ingredients are very fresh. In my mind they are burrowing the Subway assembly line idea but instead of bread they use pitas. I enjoy fresh veggies and fast service but would enjoy them more so at another restaurant where the pita doesn't come with. \n\nI am giving four stars because they're doing what they're advertising which is putting things in a Pita and doing it with efficiency  too."
0,"Okay, here is the only review you need.  I have been going to this buffet for more than a decade, possibly since its inception when the cost was $16.99, and also hold platinum membership at the Rio.  At that time the lobster and crab legs alone made this place for worth the cost. Then the cost went to $19.99, $24.99, 29.99, and $34.99.  All the while the quality increased at least in proportion with the cost. They added clams, an entire sushi bar, and always had high quality, fresh seafood no matter the preparation.  So, I recently visited once again in March 2008 to find that the buffet was under construction. I was disappointed since this is one of the reasons for my travel to the Rio. However I understood it was probably going to be a nice upgrade so anticipated a subsequent visit. I traveled to this RIo, stayed in an upgrade suite, and went to the buffet that night of arrival. Good night! MAJOR DOWNGRADE. Sushi bar cut in half as to selection, and freshness gone. Lobster - absolute disappointment! They were as small as crawdads and my company mentioned that they were in fact crawdads, and NO I did not mix them up with the crawdad section. Crab legs? Smaller than average and dirt and grime all over the shells, like they were just caught out of filthy infested waters. They upgraded the furniture like some sort of modern city joint - not the nice homely place it was. So to sum this up the buffet is worth $24.99 - not a dime more! Poor quality and lower than average. Better food at Todai, or Onami - franchise type seafood buffets. Side note - rooms poor quality, so overall perhaps this was recessionary effect."
0,"Okay, to make it short the facts:\n\n- 1.5 hours waiting\n- 50 bucks \n- drinks expensive as hell\n\nlast but not least...

0,"Food was OK at best, service was horrible!!!! A few minutes after we were seated the waiter came over and asked if we wanted drinks we said no because we had just had a few while in the casino and wanted to enjoy our meal...he then really pushed the margarita menu and walked away annoyed that we didn't want one.  A few minutes later he came back and asked what we would like to order, I had a few questions about the menu items and once again he was annoyed. My husband ordered the pork tenderloin and I the smoked chicken quesadilla, I asked if I could get some lettuce with my quesadilla and he looked and me and sharply said \""NO\""!!!  I asked if I could have my quesadilla easy on the black beans and he said no the beans are already \""pre-pasted\"" at that point I wanted to change my order but worried if I did he would spit in my food! We also ordered the corn with cotija cheese. SERIOUSLY no more that 7 minutes after we ordered our meal was delivered to our table, great if you are at casual eatery but the look and feel of our meal was VERY manufactured. My husband said the first few bites of his tenderloin were good and then the heavily salted and spiced taste got old. My quesadilla was slightly burnt on the bottom but was edible. The corn was sooo salty we had to send it back and we never send food back, but we thought since our waiter was being such a jerk...why not. We exchanged the corn for the asparagus and that was much better. We ate fast an just wanted to get out of the restaurant! It is literally the WORST dining experience we have ever had in Las Vegas"
1,"This place gets it. Although busy at lunch, greeted with a smile. Order was at my table pretty quickly. My order was right, but I saw many folks send theirs back because it was wrong. I am picky when it comes to gyros, these were awesome! My second time there, and I will be back."
1,"The Beer Market is just that. A BEER market. No vodka, no food.  Just beer. And oh-so-much of it.  The number of pages in the Beer Market's beer bible may just rival the number of pages in the actual Bible and categorized for viewing ease.  Any beer and/or beer type you could ever think of is listed amongst their many offerings.  Beer Market's service is fast and friendly; and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting.  The perfect place to watch the Seahawks kick the 49ers butts - at least it was last night! \n\nBonus - the beer is reasonable AND you can bring your own food in to enjoy."
0,"So expensive. I know it's a gift shop, but when you pay \u00a35 quid for a stick of Rock it's getting out of line. \n\nThis place's sole purpose is to rob little kids for the pocket money they were given for the school trip. And on that subject, what kid wants to buy a Ruler! You look forward all year to escaping the school for a day trip only to buy something that reminds you of school. Backwords Logic.\n\nThey do have a great selection of Sweets, I'll give them that, but I can't imagine them selling them to anyone else but tourists (not that they need much local patronage anyway).\n\nThe VERY same goods can be purchased at the newsagent at the bottom of the castle for a fraction of the price, head there instead!"
0,Food is not authentic Mexican one bit. It's edible but so is Taco Bell. Not worth the money.
1,"Very Nice!  The service was wonderful, the portions were huge, and the food was excellent.  There were 6 in my party:  1 had the Ribeye, 2 had the Sea Bass (catch of the day) and 3 had the Queen Cut Prime Rib.  Everyone was very pleased with their food (I had the sea bass - Yum), and we couldn't believe how large the \""Queen cut\"" of Prime Rib was!\n\nIt's pricey, but pretty much everything in Las Vegas is.  I would go back again, given the chance."
0,"I would give this restaurant 1 star, but the food itself was not too bad, so I am giving it 2 stars.  We found this restaurant via Groupon, so we decided to give it a try.  I will say this:  the food options are great for anyone who is trying to eat healthfully.  That is the only positive I can mention.  The service is some of the worst I've ever encountered.  We waited 7 minutes or so just to be acknowledged at the front door, and I finally flagged down a girl w/ dreadlocks & kneesocks, who rudely said \""I'm not your server, but I'll find you a table\"".  Wow - Thank you so much for doing your job!  After being sat, we waited and waited....and waited until finally flagging down our server.  she was the only server working, but the restaurant was not even busy - she had maybe 3 or 4 other tables but seemed completely overwhelmed.  We placed our entire order (since we were only there during our lunch hour) - and also because we weren't sure when we'd see her again.  The hummus arrived, and I will admit: it was delicious.  HOWEVER, the portion size was absurd - It was barely more than 2 tablespoons of hummus on the plate.  Give me a break!  We got the lemongrass chicken wrap, which I would definitely go back for (for takeout only) - and we also ordered the italian sandwich, which was just OK.  \nThe ambience in Elixir is awful - It's a nice-sized space with potential, but is decorated in a way that makes it look tacky, cold and unwelcoming. Ick.\nI would never eat in this 'restaurant' again, but would consider getting takeout, because the food itself was pretty good.  The service, on the other hand, is embarassing and I would be shocked if they were still open this time next year."
0,I spent New Years Eve here because of the extended happy hour. As always the drinks and food are amazing. I've been to this location twice and I believe this will be my last time coming. The blonde bartender was by far the rudest and took for ever for her to serve you. She would glance over but it seemed like she tried to avoid our group as much as possible. We were waiting to buy drinks not just one either but many and it seemed impossible to achieve. I will stick to the ones I know where they're friendly and willing to keep our drinks filled.
1,"Great place, great people, well recommended."
1,One of the best MX food restaurants I have been to! I am a regular.
1,OMG!  Fantastic! Come early on a Saturday night and order the mama's gravy special.  You will not be disappointed.  They sell out by 7:00 and i understand why. The only thing I am disappointed about is that I did not find this place sooner. On weekends you will need a reservation. Try the eggplant rollitini appetizer. Delish! The cannoli is the best I have ever had.  It rivals Mike's Pastry in Boston.  This place is full of regulars and the owner knows everyone's name.
0,"The decor of the restaurant looks nice, however that's all that was worth the trip. First of all the restaurant is very far away from the strip and all other popular destinations. \n\nFor 2 people, we ordered the dumplings, Korean noodles, and lemon chicken. The dumplings were ice cold and smelt like dog food. They are made with cheap wonton wrappers and they claim to be made with shrimp and pork, but trust me you can't taste or see any of these ingredients. The noodles were alright but too plain for the price- also the menu listed the noodles as \""sweet potato noodles\"" but they were cellophane noodles. The chicken was a teriyaki katsu cutlet drenched in a thin translucent lemon sauce that you could easily make at home or buy at a teriyaki restaurant for a quarter of the price. Also every dish on the menu desperately needs RICE! But they don't offer it unless you ask (pay extra).\n\nThe service was lousy. Although they just opened our waitress was clueless about the menu. The waiters kept having personal conversations right next to us while they were serving us. Last note: You cannot find the bathroom easily and the servers don't care to be helpful."
0,"I don't think my fianc\u00e9 or I will ever return to a Black Angus. We don't go out often...so when we want to do something special on the weekends we want to skip the dishes end enjoy some fine cuisine and have a pleasurable evening together. However...our last experience was anything but.\n\nWe went to the Black Angus located in Chandler, Arizona on March 8th (so 2 and a half weeks ago from this point). It It seemed like a normal enough place and we were shown to our table. One of the first things we noticed, and my fianc\u00e9 asked about, was if the place used to be an IHOP...as the tables seemed to have that kind of quality to them.\n\nOur waitress Emily arrived, gave us our menus, and asked us what we'd like to drink. As we usually do we ordered lemonades. Emily said that they had strawberry-raspberry lemonades and, thinking this was just a flavor, we said sure. She promptly returned with our lemonades and, I will admit, we were pleasantly surprised. We just expected it to be a reddish colored drink but this had real fruit in it. So being as thirsty as I was (there was no water on the table up to this point) I downed mine in a quick fashion and asked for a refill. She then said she'd bring me back a water with the lemonade because they were $2.99 a refill. We were shocked. We just wanted lemonade period. We didn't know we'd ordered SPECIAL lemonades that were three dollar a drink. We reluctantly allowed her to get another one because we didn't know if there were any NORMAL lemonades at this point...since, after all, that's what we thought we asked for. We looked at the menu, which to me was horribly overpriced, and I asked my fianc\u00e9 if she was SURE this is where we wanted to eat. Since she was just trying to go with the flow of it she said it'd be fine and that it wasn't a big deal. If only...\n\nWe ordered the 2 for $54 meal deal that offered an appetizer, 2 sides per meal, and then the entree per each person. We got our sampler and were not impressed. It was okay but I've had the same kind of thing at Applebee's and other restaurants.\n\nWhen we finally got our meals...well...that's when things started to go from bad to worse. One of the things I noticed when I ordered my meal, which was a disappointment, was that the biggest sized steak available in this meal deal was a 12 oz new york or ribeye. Not what I'd call large by any means. When I looked at my steak, and began to cut it up, I managed to trim off about 20% of it in fat alone, and the portions of the sides were on the small side. My fianc\u00e9's meal was not much better. The grated parmesan looked and tasted odd and somehow, to her utter amazement, they managed to screw up the green beans somehow. Even two weeks later, when we mention all this to people, she still can't understand how someone can fail to cook green beans in such a way that they taste horrible. The food, overall, was of average quality and not what we'd expect from a place like Black Angus.\n\nOur waitress made a guest appearance once or twice (with the second time being to deliver the slice of cheesecake to top off our meal) so we were left wondering half the time if we had a waitress at all.\n\nFinally we elected to tip the waitress 15% of our bill since some of the problems were not hers and we didn't want her to have a bad evening which might boil over into someone else's bad meal experience. This took our total bill of $68.70 up to a bit over $79. \n\nWe were not thrilled with our visit to the establishment, as you can see. So we decided we'd go home and leave a comment on the website listed at the bottom of the receipt, like most restaurants have. When I put in the website I was confused: why is it asking what my opinions are on various combo ideas when I had a bad experience. I discovered this was the entire purpose of the website. I had to actually go to the Black Angus website and merely leave a comment.\n\nAt this point we were fairly content to leave it at that, now that we gave some feedback, but the manager of the restaurant, Matt, decided to contact us to discuss what happened and see what he could do to make it right. I told him I didn't believe it was his or Emily's fault about the prices, as they are decided by someone higher up in the food chain (no pun intended), but it would have been nice to have been informed about the refill price on these special lemonades, larger portion sizes, and for the staff to be a bit more attentive (it's odd having to share a water at a place where it averages $30 a person). I always believe in second chances but my fianc\u00e8 was a bit harder to convince I succeeded, as Matt offered to send us a gift card. \n\nOver a week passed by and nothing showed up in the mail. I actually had to contact Matt to find out what was going on and if one was sent at all. He said he'd forgotten it in his car but it would show up soon. Okay...that's fine. Things happen. Then it showed up today. A $20 gift card. We found it insulting. I don't know what we expected but not this."
0,"I got the warm mozzarella appetizer and the mushroom pasta dish... Not very good.\n\nThe mozzarella appetizer was good for the price but i would have to say that my pasta with mushroom and truffle oil was gagtastic. I seriously do not know why it tasted that way, but it got me nauseous and was extremely watery!\n\nProbably never coming here again.... sorry!"
1,"A lounge in Vegas dedicated to the psychedelic music of the Beatles? No thanks. Free vodka drinks for ladies 10-12am. Uh...sure!! I'm Chinese, I can't turn down free!!\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm no Beatles hater, but having to listen to 'Yellow Submarine' and 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' sounded like less than party-hyphy-fun on a Friday night on my sister's Bachelorette weekend in Vegas. But boy, was I wrong!\n\nThe front of the lounge accommodated a mini \""pre\""-lounge complete with a full bar and humongous neon pink letters spelling 'Revolution' in which you could actually sit in, I nested on the 'o'. Very comfy. I was actually not aware of the real lounge till about 20 minutes after I arrived. When people started sifting in and out of a doorway to the left of the bar I started to think the party existed in there. I was right...so the rest of the dopey Bachelorette party I was with trudged through the doorway to discover a way bigger lounge with a way bigger full bar, a dance floor and a DJ.\n\nWhen we got there at 10:30, the joint was not crowded, but it was packed by 11pm. The walls projected images of walking, silhouetted hands with faces traipsing about the club amongst cartoon flowers and trippy, spinning swirls. Go-go dancers in skin baring ultra-minis and bikini tops danced on the table and bar tops. The music was very good; mixing in a huge serving of modern hits, several tablespoons of  Michael Jackson, a shot of Soft Cell (...tainted love...), a wisp of Journey and half a dash of Beatles songs. \n\nThe drinks were a bit weak and smiley cocktail waitresses kept hocking these sugary-sweet lemon drop shots that were pretty worthless with alcohol content - but they were free so my gratitude keeps me from griping too much. All in all, I loved the diverse, laid back crowd and the hybrid club-lounge vibe.\n\nThe next time I'm Vegas, even if they're not offering free drinks, I'm there...because this place is groovy, baby! (Trite, I know, but I couldn't help myself.)"
1,"These donuts were fantastic. We were in the area on vacation and as is customary, I had to find a local donut shop. I could not have been more excited to stumble across this gem! My husband picked out an old-fashioned, chocolate-glazed donut. I grabbed a chocolate covered sprinkle raised donut as well as a chocolate-covered cake donut and I was blown away. Amazing crisp outside with soft inside, not too doughy and perfect frosting ratio. We were incredibly impressed, and the prices were great too!"
1,"I've never used a service like this before & it's genius. I have scoliosis so I can't do any heavy lifting at all. We needed furniture, appliances, electrical stuff, mattresses taken away asap & they did it same day within a couple hours & only took 20 mins. I couldn't believe how fast & professional they were. I would definitely recommend to all my friends/fam & use again!"

We knew it would be rather expensive but were ok with that as we were expecting the food to be exceptional. \n\nTo start with, it's a bit out of the way. you have to walk through all the shops and the entire Bellagio Casino to get there. We came from Caesars which in theory should not be that far but it took us about 20 minutes to walk there. \n\nWhen we got there, they let us know they had a fixed menu since it was a holiday (Valentine's Day) it was $145 per person which was a little more than what I would have ordered from their regular menu, but again, I was ok with it because I was expecting sensational food. \n \nThe meal was a seven course meal which took entirely too long between courses. I know they were busy, but it was about 20 minutes between courses, and dinner took 3 plus hours. It was uncomfortable to sit for that long. We were so tired of sitting and waiting that we were tempted to leave before the main course - which was strip steak.  (It was really good by the way - I would probably give it an 7/10). \n\nThe lobster pot pie that everyone raves about was just ok. It wasn't bad, but I was expecting something better and it was very rich. Combined with the very rich caviar parfait and the muse, and oyster soup that was also part of the dinner, it was WAY too much richness, in fact, by the time I got to the pot pie I could barely eat any because my stomach couldn't handle all that rich food. It needed something lighter and more acidic to break it up. The whole meal was just too heavy. \n\nAll in all we spent about $400 with drinks and gratuity, and for the money it wasn't worth it. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go across the street to Paris @ Gordon Ramsay Steak. We ate there the next night. It was half the price and much better!"
1,"Went here Saturday night, a party of 12, for our work \""holiday gathering\"". First time I had ever been, and kind of ashamed to say first time I even noticed this place. Must have driven by  it a couple dozen times, shopping at Traders Joes, and never once noticed it there. \nNeedless to say, I regret not knowing about this place until now. They seemed comfortable handling such a large party, and judging by the party rooms in the back of the restaurant they have plenty of practice! I can't for the life of me remember our servers names (2 gentlemen) but they handled everything great. Each server basically had one side of a very long table. \nGreat explanations and suggestions from the servers. They were extremely knowledgeable about all the food, and promptly answered any questions we had about the menu. Even getting down to details about how the food is prepped and cooked. That I really loved. \nThe apps were great we had the calamari, and crab dip. We ordered 2 of each and they were gone within minutes.\nEveryone seemed to really enjoy their food, out of 12, 1 dish was sent back for being under cooked. I loved my food as did my wife, I had the halibut, which according to our server is one of the most popular on the menu. The halibut was cooked perfectly, served on one of the most delicious crab/potato cakes I have ever had. Wife had the lamb, came cooked perfectly. and was delicious. \nOne drink was forgotten, but was comped at the end.\nOverall, everyone left very happy, all of the staff was great, would love to come back and try it without a huge group!"
0,"I fly weekly on United Airlines and am a member of their mileage plus program.  Despite the fact that I thought United was a sub-par airline, let me tell you, US Airways is even worse!  \n\nNO MOVIES or ENTERTAINMENT on the planes unless you are going to Hawaii or international.  What the hell?  This makes a 5 hour flight back from the east coast a hell trip.  Especially given that non-alcoholic drinks are $2.  Food is $7.  Checked bags are $$$..  This airline is a joke.  Do not fly them, let them go out of business.\n\nSeats are god awful uncomfortable.\n\nService is surly and rude.  Avoid."
0,"Terrible.  Very disappointed. We started with the Truffle Mac And cheese. It was overcooked.  The cheese plate had cheese I never heard of.  I had the American Clam Bake, again overcooked.  \n\nIt's a shame this group owns this space because something really cool could be at this location."
1,Found this place through yelp. Lives up to the great reviews. Friendly with good food! I'll be coming back a lot.
0,"I really don't understand the hype about this place under the new management.  The food is really blah.  Really really blah.  Went for brunch once and it was just greasy and icky.  Love the original decor with all it's rustic charm, but the food was a non-starter.  And they don't serve poutine anymore!!!  Seriously, what is a diner without poutine?!?!  Don't waste your time."
0,"For the price, the food is bland and tasteless.  There is nothing mexican about this place.  Even the margaritas suck.  Also, they put taco loco out of business.  \n\nScrew you emilianos."
1,A great place to eat. Fresh food and good people behind the bar.
1,"Pastries, sandwiches,light lunches. Terrasse outside behind patisserie. Late evening treat seekers beware; virtually nothing left by then."
0,"Food is okay. Most of the menu seems high priced. Service is inconsistent. One day it's great and another day it's bad. If the service was exceptional all the time the high menu prices wouldn't be as noticeable. Happy hour is okay with discounts on drafts, drinks and appetizers (bar only). They have about a dozen televisions in the bar plus trivia, and karaoke."
0,"Literally the WORST dunkin I have ever been to. Slow, rude staff. Waited for over 20 minutes for our order and watched while people that came in after us got served. When my fianc\u00e9 asked why they tried to offer us a different order that hadn't been claimed. Best part is, the guy came and claimed the food they were about to give to us! They didn't even care to apologize in fact they were rude to us for being a but upset about not getting what we paid for! We asked for a refund and left, the girl slammed the cash register drawer and practically slapped the money in my hand. I will NEVER return to this location again. I work in customer service so I try really hard to be understanding bc I know what it's like but blatant incompetence and ride\nDemeanor is not forgivable."
0,"I think any restaurant that disrespects a customer deserves a one. \n\nJust took take out  and specifically asked for the egg drop soup to be served dine in, while we waited for our take out.\n\nA long wait ensues - about 15 mins - no soup, no take out. Our order gets called, so I come up to the counter. I point out that we did order the soup for dine-in. The woman nods then says... \""Hmmm... Whatever...\"" She proceeds to call out the next take out order.\n\nI walk out and tell myself I would never give these people a penny of my business... Ever!"
0,"This is our second time in 5 years to Toby Keith's bar. I wanted to give it another chance. This time it still wasn't a place I would visit if I wanted a good meal. The atmosphere is cool, very big, good for a concert. But on a weds night with maybe 50 people in it it's seems deserted! Our waitress was very cute, but had no clue on that she was a waitress. She was concerned with flirting with the bar and male staffers. She's hanging out with her friends at another table as Im waiting for her to come back and get my payment for the bill she just left...maybe she is just giving me time to write this review. The food is decent, turkey melt is a 3 1/2 star. The burgers are a 2 star, it's big, but you can tell it's a frozen patty, dry, no flavor. Other than that if you go to the bathrooms don't be surprised if it might be dirty and no hand soap. With 20 or so staff you see there is little interest in the little details of a restaurant. If your coming here for a bar or night out.... You should have fun!"
1,"I am so happy that Dr Sawyer was recommended to me. Both my husband and I found him top notch. \n\nHe is very kind and has a great bedside manner. He spends time and gets to know his patients over the course of their pregnancy. He will also tell you his opinion and give you the facts and his recommendations and has the knowledge to back them up. \n\nHis office staff is pretty good. Sometimes they were not always the friendliest to me. I know we all have bad days, so I am just going to let it slide since Dr Sawyer is great. \n\nHe was a great doctor when I was in labor. He kept good tabs on my progress. I had to have a c section and everyone was impressed the he used dermabond instead of staples. \n\nSo don't hesitate- he is the best doctor!"
0,"after reading the reviews on here i drove 30 minutes from west vegas to this salon cuz i am too cheap to pay 60 bux for a cut... i had the strangest experience!  after i came signed my name, the girl came to get me barely said hi or looked at me.  i thought she looked adorable and was very excited.  i sat in her chair and told her what i wanted, i said my hair looks like a mushroom (just because it is so grown out)and i want it cut up into an A-line and layered, the back stuff taken off.  i had already washed my hair and didnt put any leave-in conditioner or gel because i read that they dont wash your hair so it looked extra frizzy.  I have gotten this cut for the last ten years from many people and have never had a problem. its a classic cut.  my hair is wavy not super curly or anything.  she said to me \""when i am done its still going to look like a mushroom\""!! well that really made me not want a cut from her, what a weird strange and bizzare thing to say to me before you cut my hair!  then she said 'your hair is really frizzy, so if i cut your hair into layers its going to get all whispy and fly everywhere and look like a mushroom'.  clearly this young woman knows NOTHING about cutting curly or wavy hair.   i tried to get out of the chair because i no longer wanted her to TOUCH me or my hair and she tried to stop me from getting out, said 'i am just putting the bib on you, honey' all full of attitude like i was an idiot.  i said 'i dont feel comfortable having you cut my hair\"" as i left, she told me, 'keep smokin that crack'. she really said that! i wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemies!  the only good thing about my experience is that it happened before i got a terrible mushroom shaped cut from her!"
0,"The company is a rouse!  Mike Ferry pays his sales staff a little above minimum wage...hourly.Some of these individuals have backgrounds like waitressing and internet gambling. Less than one percent are college educated!  Many clients request to get out of their coaching contracts because it DOES NOT WORK!!  It is a TOTALLY unprofessional business environment with male members of the call center sales team making BLATANT lude and sexual comments.\n\nAs a result, a formal complaint has been made with the EEO."
0,Food was pretty average.  Waitress was pleasant.  I ordered the mixed grill.  It was all chicken.  Where was the mix that was on the menu?!?  $15.99 for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain.  No rice. Burnt naan.  I will return to Puran in Bloomington:)
1,"EVOO done in a hundred delectable ways. This is my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I know! That's a hard stamp to lick but here's why I love Nora's Wine Bar and Osteria. \n\nNora indulges in the Italian culture. It plays to an older crowd. A more sophisticated crowd that's slightly more pretentious than Nora's Cuisine. But that's OK because this is a place where you can take a date or your visiting folks and be proud. The wine selection is top notch and you can even do tastings at the enomatic bar. \n\nTheir homemade bread is served with 3 different olive oils, and 3 different sea salts. Seriously, they had me at the salt at this point and the food was free so far. The Salish Alderwood smoked sea salt was so good I had to buy a bottle on the way out.  Their Bruschette are just to die for. My favorite is the Eggplant caponata.  Pair that with the cheese selection and I'm already feeling stuffed at the Primi.  We ordered the a traditional pasta dish but it was slightly salty.\n\nI couldn't even make it to the desert which I'm sure will be divine. Then again, McDonald's 99c soft serve was calling my name in the next door plaza.\n\nIf I love Nora's anymore than this, I'll name my next child after the restaurant. \n\nNext visit: Choose another bottle, go down the list of small bites, skip the main and order desert."
1,"The service was excellent. They are very nice and attentive. I love the atmosphere! It did not take long at all to receive our food. I will be honest, I have had better mexican food in my days, but no real complaints. I would go back for a casual lunch or fun dinner date."
1,"So far, I have only come in here for breakfast, but I have loved everything I'ved tried! This place is right by the gym so the location is very convenient. I've gotten the oatmeal with bananas, cinnamon, raisins. The mulitgrain protein pancakes and granola french toast have to be my favorites. I loved the turkey sausage and egg whites. The portions are pretty big, which I like because I can share with someone or take the rest home. I love the Berry Blast smoothie which is nice when I'm on the go and can't sit down to eat. I can stop in and just grab a smoothie. I have been here quite a few times and I notice that sometimes the food can take about 15-20 minutes to come out, even when I only have one entree for myself. Other than that, the staff is very nice, the place is clean, and the food is tasty!"
1,"This is the type of place were it in NYC or Chicago it would be getting national attention as a foodie hotspot. Madison is lucky to have it...for the superb craft cocktails alone. The carnivore-centric food is often brilliant and always of good quality. Highly recommended. Beware though, the place is small and you will need to wait at peak times for seating."
0,"Full disclosure about me before I review Yoga Nirvana: I am a yoga teacher and a Licensed Massage Therapist. \n\nAfter reading such rave reviews about Yoga Nirvana and particularly about Jim and his class, I decided to make my way to this studio for Jim's Vinyasa class. Never in my life have I ever been in such an unsupportative environment. Jim's adjustments are completely inappropriate. I should never have to feel my yoga teacher's good's on my body and his breath breathing down the side of my neck as if he was about to make out with me as I'm receiving an adjustment. (And these were just a few of the adjustments I received within the first five minutes of class, it went on from there). Additionally, the innuendos about the female anatomy and women's breast tissue were also completely inappropriate and offensive.\n\nFurthermore, Jim's instruction of igniting mula bandha are grossly inaccurate. No senior Ashtanga teacher will ever instruct you to squeeze your anus in order to cultivate mula bandha. In fact, senior Ashtanga teachers go out of their way to explain that this is not a correct application of mula bandha and that in doing so, will only create constipation. \n\nThere are plenty of other more informed and respectful yoga teachers in the Phoenix area to practice yoga with. Jim Keegan is not one of them. It pains me as a yoga teacher to know that this kind of inappropriate and arrogant behavior is masquerading under the guise of yoga.\n\nThe only reason I'm even giving this studio a star is because Yelp is making me."
0,Will never come here again their rice was hard like always and the food was cold as usual hated it! !!!
0,"This review is for the poor service. It was so bad, we walked out before our main food ever came. It took 25 minutes to order food and after 1 1/2 hours, we asked if our food is on the way. The waiter made excuses saying he doesn't usually work with these cooks today and that they have their own thing going on back there...blah blah blah...basically, he didn't want us to blame him for the bad service. But, they're a team and he should've be on top of it. We walked out after sitting there for two hours and empty drinks that haven't been checked on for 30 minutes. This place needs to be on the RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE SHOW. We will never eat here again and strongly suggest anyone shouldn't either. There are way better Mexican restaurants in town that have authentic food with better prices. If you're looking for authenticity and good service, you should go elsewhere. This place is reeks americanized Mexican food and clueless waiters. Don't disappoint yourself by going here."
1,"This review is for the Spa at GVR...\n\nIt was amazing.  They now offer 20% off 7 days a week for vegas residents.  The massage was amazing.  I had Jodi, and she was awesome!  It was relaxing, and perfect.  The only thing i would have hoped of more for was more co-ed stuff.  They only had 1 jacuzzi where i could hang out with my boyfriend before/after our massages."
0,"Native  New Yorker in Tempe was OK, I had not been to this location in several years and was waiting for a friend that lives near this location. \n\nI know they are famous for their wings but I was not in the mood for them today so I got their Club wrap with fries and a coke. Along with some fried mushrooms. The total was 15 bucks which I thought was a bit expensive for the little bit of food I got, and I could of got the same thing pretty much that was bigger at subway for 7 bucks. Plus that the coke tasted watered down.\n\nEverything was served promptly and my service was good, the decor is cool definitely a good sports bar with TV's everywhere you look.\n\nI will say that the food was OK, but afterwords my stomach hurt for several hours afterwords, the fries and mushrooms were really greasy so not sure if it was the grease or something else, but I would say that I would probably not eat here again if I had a choice."
0,"If you're going to claim sandwich superiority, you'd better deliver.  This place is a shade better than Quizno's, but not by much.  The ordering process is tedious.  The store layout isn't convenient.  It's just not a great place.  Better than Subway, worse than Jimmy John's or Milio's."
0,"Billing dept. leaves something to be desired. When billed during my wives visit, they said they had made a mistake and overcharged us. I had to wait two days for my bank account to be credited before they could re-bill me the correct amount. Then I started receiving statements for a balance due.  I called the billing dept and after running in circles with many excuses I was told that the account is settled. But, since then I have still been receiving statements for a balance due. It doesn't seem the billing dept. knows what they are talking about. Tried to call them to get the story but billing dept. closes at 4:45.  One more inconvenience in a long line of inconveniences."
0,"I was tired of paying huge sums of money for a massage at the expensive hotels on the strip. I read these reviews and wondered how bad they could be for $99 (1 hour swedish with 1 hour foot). Buyer Beware! This is hands down (no pun intended) the worse massage I ever received. You do have to pay up from so there is no way to get your money back. The old man massage therapist hardly spoke any English, and had very long nails. He was giving a massage really at all, just lightly touching my back. I asked him to press harder (so I could actually feel something) and he said in broken English that this was his 5th massage that day and he was too tired. The massage only lasted 40 minutes. The foot massage was even worse. He left me with my feet in a bucket of water and disappeared. Twenty minutes later I had to go walking through the strip mall to find the therapist who disappeared. I found him smoking a cigarette next door. The hour long foot massage I paid for lasted 29 minutes. When finished I called a cab who told me it would be 55 minutes to get a driver there. I ended up taking the bus back to the Wynn. Once you go there is no way to complain (no one speaks English) and no way to get your money back. Don't make the same mistake I did!!!"
1,I love Platinum Entourage they do the best hair and are a very professional company!! \nYour great Tod!\nKelly ;)
1,Best buffet hands down! Every thing here is amazing. The dessert island is the best if you can save room for it!

1,"I have NEVER had a bad meal here! Amazing food, wine list and overall a great little gem in Cave Creek. My husband and I frequent this place for dinner (the tenderloin trio is amazing) and I would recommend this place to anyone who loves a fantastic meal. It's also very romantic in the winter, cozy with a nice fireplace!"
0,"Melissa, the waitress was very attentive, she was great.  Bloody marry needs improvement, drinks in general were lousy.  I'm still not impressed with the food.  Schucks."
0,"Oh God I forgot I ever dined here but I guess I just blocked it out. I came here with a group of 12 people. One thing in general about Vegas is that dining in large groups just screws everything up and I really feel that the service since they add gratuity automatically they feel they can just shut down quality service automatically. It took at least 20 minutes to get a seat on a fairly slow 11 am on a Monday. When we were finally seated we waited another 30 just to get our orders in. I understand that restaurants want to get the food out all at once. But, I really feel that if the food is done they should starting bringing it out. My whole crew ordered breakfast except me who ordered a club sandwich. The food no joke took almost an hour to come out and mine must of been finished first because the fries were ice cold and sandwich was soggy all the way through the bread. When it was time to pay we were not allowed to split up the check any less than 2 ways. The whole fiasco took over 2 hours and wasted a good chunk of the day for a group of my friends that were leaving that day. Never again and stay away."
1,"I waited here and borrowed their WiFi while my wife was up the street at AGH. Very clean. Very chill. Great service. Not too full or busy, but bustling. Great place to people watch as it's on a corner with big glass windows on both sides and is across the street from a popular park. Parking isn't as bad as most places in Pittsburgh and most coffee shops anywhere. I always appreciate a coffee shop with regular brewed coffee that is decent but cheap. This place had just about everything I could ask for."
1,"Love the food here, we tried almost all the sliders and had a huge thing of fries that were delish!  We sat at the bar next door and ordered.  This place is a definite return joint for us, and it's 24/7 love that!"
0,"I LOVE the perfect scoop on Tropicana and Fort Apache- but this one... Not so much. We bought the groupon a couple of months ago and thought we would have no problem using it, since we grocery shop at Sprouts which isn't far from here. Boy was I wrong. We have only been here once when it was actually open. The hours posted mean nothing. They supposedly open at noon each day, but I waited 15 minutes last week after grocery shopping and no one was there to open the store or answer the phone. Today we went at 1pm, an hour after they were supposed to be open, and no one is here again. How do you tell your two year old you've promised ice cream that she isn't getting it again? You take her somewhere else. I hate that I bought a groupon for this location and am stuck with it. What a waste of money. I will stick with the other locations from now on and not waste my time trying to come back here."
0,"The food is mediocre and so are the drinks. I don't drink beer but this seemed so popular. Worse then the food & watered down drinks was the horrible horrible service. My food took forever only to find out it had been given accidentally to another table who ordered the same thing. And had recently arrived. It happens,  but my waitress didn't seem apologetic and my food didn't get to me until over an hour after I arrived. I had ordered their garlic cheese bread which was just a thin crust cheese pizza with no pizzaz. \n\nI really wanted to avoid heading to Yelp about my awful experience as I contacted them directly two weeks ago right after my experience. Needless to say I got no reply, no apology, nada.\n\nWill never go back."
0,"Novelty - 8/10 - Go once to tell people you've been there.  And duh your going to see sexy nurses and a unique restaurant concept that is telling you to eat so unhealthy it will kill you.  Its expensive for the food you receive but worth the novelty of it and the few pictures you leave with. \n\nFood - 3/10 - Take my word and other yelp comments the burger is nothing special.  The meat is very bland and has no memorable seasoning or sauce (yawn).  For a \""burger\"" joint when calories are no concern you think it was the most amazing flavor ever.  It's not.  Burger Guru's go elsewhere.  The fries were a huge disappointment as well.  I went with 6 other people.  We all blamed the soggy fries on being the \""bottom\"" of the pan.  We got more unlimited fries when a fresh batch came out and no one loved them at all.  Its funny cause there is a video playing on flat screens and when we saw the crispy looking fries on screen we were like 'we want those!'.  The milkshakes were also disappointing because people expected more flavor like thick ice cream.  It was a very generic base that they just pump flavored syrup into, no blenders.  Also, people that dined the same day as us found a hair ball in the double burger.  It was pretty gross when he held it up and the nurses came running to replace!  I cant wait for his review!\n\nWho will go again?  0 out of 6 of us.\n\nWho is talking about this place to their friends and family? 6 out of 6 of us.\n\nWho felt a little sick to their stomachs? 4 out of 6 of us.\n\nOverall go once have fun.  But if you want a great tasting burger and some calories that may lead to an eventual heart attack find a gourmet burger spot with some crispy bacon, blue cheese crumbles, special sauce, and maybe even a fried egg on top.  A good burger is good til the last bite, this was not."

1,A pleasant experience all around. The gals on the phone worked around my schedule and were very accommodating. They explained all that needed to be done and definitely saved me some money too!
1,"Excellent!! My fiancee and I went here. The staff was very welcoming, very attentive and friendly. The food outstanding! I have never had Buffalo and I must say I have been missing out. It was cooked perfect along with my filet mignon. We had French Onion soup and escargot that was so delicious. We finished off with creme brulee flambe that alo g with the view it was delish. Allow around fantastic place to eat. The best meal I had in Montreal,if I came back it would definitely be to eat here."
0,"we have been to red velvet cafe many times...here are the pros and cons:\n\nPros:  \n- Great desserts (mini vegan cakes) at under 250 calories.  \n- Great guacamole and outstanding hummus (not on menu anymore but you can still get it).  It costs more here than the same order at the Fashion Mall location, I believe.\n- Never very crowded\n\nCons:\n- Pricey!  (esp. the cookies!)\n- Don't stay open past 8 pm\n- Some of the worst wait staff I've had - it is consistently bad - have had a couple of different guys and girls - both equally pathetic.  You will need to flag them down for a refill of tea.  Went there last night and waited 15 min before the guy came and took my order.  \n- Again, Pricey for what you get!  Our tab was more than $86 for dinner /tea/desserts(I had a wrap and tea and dessert) - we did not have any appetizers.  Imagine if we would have had good service, the bill would have been higher due to higher tip!  LOL!\n- Not many table tops that will hold 4+ people -- I think maybe 6-7 total.\n\nWe made our mind up last night, after the consistent bad service and high tab for an average meal that we won't go back there again except for desserts and that will be \""to go\""...\n\nThe owner/chef is there a lot - I don't know why she doesn't notice that her wait-staff is horrible and killing her business.  She also needs to lower her prices by 10-15%...She should read these reviews or at least have a suggestion box at her register..."
1,"Food here is exceptional. Maybe a few extra cooked vegtables somewhere though. Still 5 out of 5. Was in vegas for 6 days and ate here everyday either for brunch or dinner. The only downfall was the food servers at ice cream omelette meat carvery. It's great to have polite waiters/hosts but if the person serving your plate is slapping it on the plate with death stares and no smile, then all the great service before has come undone."
0,"I really wanted to like this place... but was disappointed.  \n\nPro's:\n*probably one of the better diners in Pittsburgh, but not of national quality\n*great industrial diner atmosphere.  Busy and feels local.\n*cheap (plates are ~7).\n\nRoom of improvement\n*staff friendliness seems hit or miss on busy days\n*few authentic ingredients (ie fake butter, fake maple syrup)\n*over use of salt (corned beef hash)\n*over medium eggs came out over easy\n*no apparent effort to support local farms or sustainable food system.\n\nIt could be great, and hopefully will be soon."
0,"Well my friend said this place was one her favorite places to go to for lunch, so we met there for some good food this last weekend.  Well I was very disappointed and my girlfriend kept apologizing for the crappy food.\n\nI will say location and decor is very nice and I will give it a star for that and the service was very good also, another star.  Thats where it stopped.\n\nFirst, she is raving about these pastry breads that they serve but they were all out for the day.  Our server stated that the cook was refusing to make anymore.  Well our table and the one next to us was very disappointed because this was something that is suppose to be tasty!  I ordered the turkey bacon wrap and it came with a side salad and some fruit.  That was the best part of my meal.  The wrap was gross and flavorless.  I evenutally just starting pulling the turkey out but there was some sauce on it that was not to my liking.\n\nI don't think I will visit this place again for food and come to think about it, not for drinks either.  I think there are better places at Fashion Show."
1,"I am a huge fan of Lavo. We went on a Sunday night which is supposedly their best night, and had so much fun! A lot of these clubs that we went to were playing this trance crap but not Lavo. Their music was right up our ally. When I'm in a club I like rap music. Give it to me dirty and with heavy beats; I'll be THAT girl on the dance floor throwing her hair around, shaking it like a salt shaker while gettin' low. Awwww yah. \n\nIt's a pretty small venue so if you're looking for something grand, you're much more likely to enjoy XS or Tryst."
0,"PAID CASH but STILL charged CREDIT.  WILL NOT REFUND.  Ordered by phone, gave credit card info. Pizza was delivered to hotel room, but driver insisted card was not billed and he needed cash.  Total was $52.17, gave $60 cash. The next day, $52.17 was still billed to credit card.  \n\nAfter repeated attempts to get a refund, calling the business daily, no refund was issued.  In 30 days of promises, I never got a single call back.  I finally had direct contact with the owner after 30 days. He informed me delivery driver had quit and kept the cash, but that as a business owner, he had to make his money somehow.  I pointed out that in order for him to make his $52.17, I was then paying $112.17 for my pizza. He said he can't control what the driver did, though as the business owner who hired the driver, he is responsible for the drivers theft.  No matter what, the customer should not pay twice.  \n\nThe owner had NO signed receipt but still refused to refund the money to the card.  He agreed I paid cash, agreed that he had not returned my phone calls, even agreed that I was told I would not be charged on my card.  This business owner simply seeks profits and will not accept any responsibility for his poor hiring choices.  \n\nI do not suggest giving them your credit card information - though I am sure the owner would really prefer sticking to cash sales anyway given his interest in profits."
0,Too busy to place a take out order is what i was told by an employee. Update your website and indicate that take out orders are not available. Im glad Ihop was available to take my order
0,"First and foremost, buyer beware. I did not end up doing business with this company, but I thought I should write a review here to let others know WHY I chose not to do business with them. Andy did a drive-by estimate for removal of a palm tree and stump grinding. Before he did the estimate, he told me over the phone that it would probably cost at least $300, which is right around what multiple other bonded and insured arborists had been quoting me at for the same service. When he came out to my property, he quoted me at $650-- over double the price of most of the bids that I got for this job. Furthermore, he tried to tell me that I should try to sell my palm tree, which anyone with experience in this field should know is NOT possible because there isn't at least 2' of space around the base of the tree-- it's outgrown its planter and needs to be cut down. That didn't exactly speak volumes to me about his knowledge of tree removal. To be honest, between his astronomical bid and his naive suggestion, I got the impression that this company is pretty shady. That may not be the case, but I'm not taking my chances."
1,Chocolate pasteries are delicious.  Crepes are nicely prepared and not overcooked which could be prepared as a desert or entree.  This location is not as busy the one in Belagio during the time I stayed in Aria.  It is conveniently located for those that are staying in Aria.  Location is not to far from the elevators from the rooms.
1,"Lunch with the girls?  Want to impress your Mother-in-Law? Show that snobby co-worker what's up? Chelsea's is it!\n\nYumyumyum!  The food is unbeatable.  Fresh and hip, with traditional roots.  We had brunch fare: Perfectly cooked eggs, potatoes that melted like butter, sausage heaven. \n\nYour order will be served up with class by the fabulous wait staff.  Oh and the location!  Natural beauty abounds.  I can't wait to come back."
1,"Hello!?! It's JEAN PHILLIPE!!! My eyes were just going bonkers looking at all the different chocolates that were available. The desserts were so eye catching and tons of souvenirs!!! They have food such as salads, sandwiches, etc. Along with coffee and tea selections. The staff was EXTREMELY helpful and so kind. I had the Opera (chocolate mousse type cake) and a vanilla eclair. THE VANILLA ECLAIR IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!! The cream is on the thicker side and it's the perfect size for your buck! The cafe latte is very good too, smooth and creamy and perfect with the sweet desserts. \n\nSouvenir wise I got the coconut and chocolate macaroons, white chocolate covered pistachios, and coconut tuilles. Every single one of them was so good! The chocolate is such high quality and not too sweet. Gotta stop by whether you buy something or not!"

1,"Overall really like this place and will definitely go back.  We had a table of 5 and everyone thought the food and overall experience was delicious.\n\n-----\n\nGOOD\nFood\nFood quality and presentation for both sushi and teppanyaki was really nice.  Steak cooked perfectly.  Fried rice was awesome.  Mexican roll nice sized portion and fresh.  Very tasty Lobster and Scallops.\n\nAtmosphere\nVery nice atmosphere.\n\nClean\nStaff was cleaning tables and grills at all times.\n\nBus Service\nWater and drinks kept full.  Empty plates removed promptly. \n\n-----\n\nNEEDS WORK\nWaiter/Host\nWas not familiar with the menu gave bad information.  Was \""slow\"" in that he seemed like he just walked out of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.\n\nPortions\nOrdered the steak and scallops and only got 4 medium sized scallops and a unusually small portion of steak.  For the price it was really off.\n\nUpcharge\nHidden $3 bucks to upcharge to fried rice for teppanyaki.  Really?  This is customary and should be included or disclosed at the very minimum\n\n-----\n\nDespite the problems the food and experience was still good.  Combined with the convenient location we'll be back a second time."
1,"Why is everybody complaining about the size of this restaurant? That's the size, deal with it or take your food to go. And kids? Really, you're on the West side of Madison, buddy...deal with it! But, i do admit it gets busy, but who doesn't like a busy restaurant? That means the food is good, right?\n\nYour bill  can go quite high if you add a protein (chicken, shrimp, beef, tofu, and just recently new meatballs).\n\nOnly complaint, potstickers are terrible, they have no flavor. They look delicious, but do not be fooled. My favorite dish (and of many others) is the penne rosa.  \n\nExcept a crowd around lunchtime, and expect kids...when in doubt!\n\nOh, and great staff here, always friendly and fast!"
1,"I had randomly booked another company for hair and makeup, but was told by someone in the industry to cancel and book with Amelia C for bridal/bridal party hair and makeup. I'm glad I did! I had an airbrush tan with Amelia, as well as hair and makeup by Haley and Melissa F. I was super stressed out with all the wedding plans and they certainly lightened the mood while making us look great. Our hair and makeup stayed fantastic through the ceremony (which included tears), 4 hours of dancing, and St. Paddy's after party! I can't imagine using anyone else for hair and makeup in Las Vegas."
0,"For the record: I'm just not that into salmonella. \n\nWe hit this place on a Wed after work for some snacks and a beer. We needed a fun place to go to fairly quickly because we have a little one that hits the sack early. \n\nIt was still happy hour -it goes until 7, so that goes in the plus column, so we ordered quesadillas ($4 on hh menu) and a cobb salad to share. The quesadillas were really only worth about $4- two of the pieces had nothing but cheese in them. The two pieces in the middle had some tomatoes, green onions and black beans. Definitely not worth the more than $4 they normally are. \n\nThen, our salad showed up with chicken that was completely raw in the middle. All the way through every slice- RAW, PINK, JELLY. We sent it back and the server was pretty apologetic. \n\nWhen it arrived, the manager brought it and literally all he was was, \""Sorry,\"" and dropped it off at the table. Maybe I'm a snob, but if I had almost made an entire family  seriously ill, I would have offered to pay for the salad. \n\nWe will probably skip this place and just hit Four Peaks from here on out."
1,Limited but good vegetarian options.  I had the tofu and eggplant. It was sweet and spicy really good.  They do delivery up to 4 miles which is always nice
0,"This is a very dishonest business. My husband and I left our car for a service and the day we went to pick it up they told us that our  car was vandalized and that someone damage our convertible top and stole our radio, Steve told us that they are not responsible for any damage and that they will NOT pay for anything, now we have to pay for the service, plus the convertible top and our radio which was a nice brand.\n\n I am very disappointed for their rude service and never getting back to them. We also found out that the next day that our car was vandalized another car was  too and their insurance doesn't cover those types of damages. Be careful if you are leaving your car for a service, they don't have a big garage to cover all the cars they have for repairs for that reason they have to leave them unprotected and can be vandalized as ours."
1,"It was my first time yesterday at this establishment. I'm always apprehensive when it comes to trying new places. I don't know about u but I feel like my nails are very personal thing for me. They were very welcoming. The lady who did my nails (Bella) knew exactly how I want my nails. If I didn't like how one was particularly shape. She went over and redid them for me. I did the full service and it was amazing. The mask and salt beads was what my legs and feet needed. It came with a massage, hot wax and callus remover. I've never been so happy with my feet. They feel rejuvenated and baby soft. If u've never had hot wax before you should definitely try it. \n\n\nI went home raving to my roommate how good of a service I was provided and that she should come in and make an appointment ASAP. Even though it's a fairly new establishment I recommend this place because of their quality of work, their professionalism and how they treat their customers. I must have inhaled 3 water bottles while I was there and kept getting up to use the bathroom. Bella was so nice about it. She was so understanding. The heat had gotten to me earlier that day and I was super dehydrated. I dubbed this my new favorite nail saloon!. Everyone GO! \n\nOooooh and did I forget to mention they open till 12?!!!! What?!?!?!"
1,"Best mani/pedi ever.  I also have to respond to the earlier review, first it isn't hard to find if you can follow directions, it's located on the 1st floor of the summerlin medical building. The reception area is really nice, the salon is an extension of mountain podiatric, and is completely separated from the md office. The chairs and foot baths were clean, I watched the employees scrub after each patron. The tools came in an individual sealed pack. They had a good selection of nail polish, all good quality, china glaze & opi that didn't look old. Allen did my mani/pedi and I was hesitant at first b/c I don't really like men doing them, but he has changed my opinion forever! He made me feel comfortable and we immediately started a conversation. I have to say he was so thorough my hands and feet have never looked better. This place is a little more expensive than the Asian chop shops, but you get what you pay for. Make an appt, they only have 3 chairs. I will definitely be coming back."
0,"Had I written this review yesterday because I was hungry, craving pasta and eating here pretty late at 9 pm, it would have gotten one more star for coming to my rescue while driving around looking for food.  24 hours later , with a clearer mind, i can say this place is average. The bread very plain, the shrimp linguine quite bland. The service and decor are quite good though. And finally, so Not the place to go for a meal for one.The size of helpings is HUGE. I had enough left over for lunch. Which would have been a good thing had the food been tasty."
1,"This is now my favorite hotel in Vegas! I stayed here twice early last year and fell in love. This place is a fresh change from the older themed hotels and has some fabulous restaurants (see my other reviews of Scarpetta and Holstein's). We put the concierge to the test upon our arrival as one of my trips was on Valentine's Day and we arrived without dinner plans. The concierge successfully booked us tickets to Zumanity and reservations for Scarpetta without any problems and we had a fabulous evening. \n\nWhat about the rooms you ask? Awesome. We were upgraded to one of the rooms with a kitchen and balcony with a view of the strip. They even have corner rooms available with views of the Bellagio fountains. Definitely the trendiest new hotel on the strip in my opinion. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving them five stars is because I think they still had some kinks to work out, but that's to be expected with a new property. I'll definitely be coming back to this property for many more visits."
1,"My husband and I LOVE this place! We have taken so many friends here to introduce them to how awesome it is. \n\nIt's a fun, simple atmosphere, casual but still nice. Food is amazing, tastes fresh and authentic. Service has always been top notch and we have been several times. In fact we're taking some more friends there this weekend! :)"
1,"Have a really cool dinner tonight, i got the sushi and BBQ. The sushi is fresh rice with a big piece of fresh fish on top,  BBQ are fresh and taste sweet. Server with shiny smile they teach me how to do the BBQ help me a lot, I am happy to having a delicious food in this wonderful restaurant ."
0,This place is right around the corner from my house and my fiance and I always take our vehicles here for washes and oil changes. It feels like this place has gotten progressively worse over the last year. This last time was the final straw. We brought both of our vehicles in last Saturday. He needed an oil change and a car wash and I just needed a wash. We waited in the filthy waiting area with the torn and stained furniture and when my car was ready it looked like it hadn't even been vacuumed and there were water spots all over it. We left to run errands before my fiance SUV was done. When we came back he went in to pay and there were additional charges. When he asked what they were for he was told that he need an extra quart of oil. He asked how many quarts were put in and was told 5. He told the girl that the engine was only a 4 quart engine. She looked confused and just stared at him. He told her that this was the last time that we would bring our vehicles there and she didn't seem to concerned. Needless to say we will be finding another place for car washes and oil changes. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Pay the extra couple of dollars and go elsewhere.
1,"This place is fantastic!  I often went to their Ahwatukee location and was so excited when I realized they had another place right by my new address.\nThe location they're in is considered a \""death spot\"" since every restaurant that has tried to make a go of it there has failed.  I can only hope this place catches on because I'll go into a deep depression if they don't make it here.  \nThis is REAL authentic Mexican food and the best I've had anywhere.  I love the street tacos and even the beans are the best I've ever had.\nGo now!!!"
0,PJ Clarke's Sucks!!! food made me sick once and then went back for a 2end try at it food was small no flavor and the 2 guys at the bar blow!
1,"Best bar in Old Town.  Incredibly friendly staff with delicious Tracy Dempsey desserts.  Always a great place to meet a character or two.\n\nA couple of my food favorites beyond the desserts are the fresh made soups, any sandwich, and, of course, the nachos.  Really, you cannot go wrong.\n\nThey have a fun Sunday brunch and if you are in town for Spring Training this should be your first stop."
0,"Bad food.  I don't think it is a problem with this location.  More of a Ruby Tuesday problem.  Food sounds good on the menu, but the appearance and taste is poor and has been past 2 times"
0,"Pizza was terrible! Came burnt, which was clearly visible and they still delivered it.  Crust was hard as a rock, too bad, was hoping to find a good pizza place in the area we just moved into!"
0,I was so very disappointed!!!  This is not even close to the Al's Beef on Taylor street.  The beef tastes old and the fries are limp and soggy.  The decor is nice but no counter space to put your tray while you get ketchup.  Not that I will ever be coming back!
1,I love the chicken shawerma!\n I absolutely loved it! Just thought I would say it twice! \nThe Baladie Cafe has a very friend and up beat staff. The food was awesome and I was so pleased we stopped in! \nDefinitely going back as soon as I can and I hope everyone will  give it a try!
0,"we were very excited when kaizen first opened, sushi in walking distance is heaven to us. the decor is nice, the prices are decent, the service is good. but the quality of product (sushi) has been on a rather fast decline lately. we were just going for convenience, but have recently given up..we'll drive the xtra mile to sushi tachi from now on."
1,Everything you could want from a buffet!
1,Our dog loved his first visit there yesterday.  Great for dogs of all ages and the staff was incredibly friendly.   Will be coming back often!
0,"His cooking was bold, spicy and has a Mexican flare.  What else would expect from a 4th generation Irishman?  I have my doubts too.  Does this this leprechaun know how to throwdown some mexican flavor in the kitchen?  \n\nread more here: http://www.bougiefood.com/?p=323"
1,Recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.  We went there for breakfast.  The portions are sizeable (I had the French Toast and had trouble finishing the meal).  They serve a mean Bloody Mary.  You will have to drive to get there; by car it is a good 20 minute car drive from the strip.  But well worth the journey.
1,"Definitely a favorite Lunch spot! My friends and I eat here often. Yummy sandwiches, soup and salad- all for a really great price. I love the newly remodeled look and open seating, specially the patio area when the weather is nice. The staff is friendly and helpful, which is always a plus for me. \n\nBe warned the portions are very generous! The Muffalettas are no joke! Their salad bar is a great option if you're not sure what you're in the mood for. Trying out the day's special is usually not a bad choice either. The only complaint I have is that I really like their pasta & meatballs except they no longer have spaghetti- only bow-ties and penne now. I hope they bring back spaghetti!!! \n\nEnjoy their complimentary mini muffins and end your meal w/ their free low-fat frozen yogurt!"
0,"DO NOT BOOK ADAM BROOKS AS YOUR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER!! We paid him in full because of a \""special\"" he was running. Our wedding is in 13 weeks, and we still have not heard a word from Adam. He has gone MIA with our money and it sounds like a lot of other people's money and pictures as well. Anyone who is filing a claim against him, please let me know. I would be more than happy to join! This guy needs to get caught."
1,"I have visited the Mandarin Oriental twice--after it first opened and two days ago.  I have not been a guest at the hotel.  I simply went as a local \""tourist\"" who wanted to see the public art in the ground floor lobby and the 23rd floor Sky Lobby. \n\nEveryone at the hotel both times was extremely courteous and helpful.  You can tell that guest service is number one priority at this property.  The first time I was there, I asked the woman at the door if it was OK to go to the Sky Lobby to view the art and she said, \""Of course, go right ahead!\""  \n\nThe hotel's public areas are very classy.  The decor is quite nice.  Riding to the 23rd floor Sky Lobby in an elevator with a bench seat brought a smile to my face.\n\nYesterday I came back to the Mandarin Oriental to have breakfast in the MOzen Bistro on the 3rd floor.  Again, all staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  I also went up to the Sky Lobby to get that wonderful view of this section of the Las Vegas Strip and part of CityCenter.\n\nOne of these days I'll spend a night here."
1,Well worth finding a parking spot.  I have been for lunch and dinner both the same menu.  The food was excellent fresh and I was told local.
1,"Ok, I'll admit Red Robin is a guilty pleasure. There are times in every foodies life where you just want to get a burger with your kids and not worry about the seven course tasting menu or what vintage of White Burgundy to order. \n\nWe went here to celebrate a special occasion with my oldest son, a meat-loving seven year old who LOVES Red Robin (god bless him!) Atmosphere is fairly loud and busy with lots of TVs showing either sports or cartoons. Basically a kid paradise.\n\nMany are suckered at Red Robin by the various burger combo's, typically which include bacon, some sort of sauce and an assortment of fried products on top. Blah. Not only do these mask the flavor of the beef, but they also reduce your life expectancy by at least six months. As a result, I order the \""natural burger\"" with a whole wheat bun, lettuce, tomato, red onion and blue cheese. My better half ordered one of their new fancy salads and my Little Man ordered the cheeseburger. Ironically we also ordered the mini-app of onion rings (also known as the cardio-kicker). Can't resist onion rings, damn it!\n\nOverall, no problems with this meal AT ALL. The steak fries that come with the burgers are pretty good and the Red Robin seasoning is addictive. The burger itself was a good size, cooked well and the toppings were fresh and crisp. BTW, I highly recommend the whole wheat bun because it is fresher and more substantial than the mushy standard bun. The salad also looked pretty good (no wilted lettuce or weird chicken). This is not the gourmet burger offered at BLT or even Big Daddy's, but it was still very tasty and you could taste the beef.\n\nWe ended our meal with, what else, but a Chocolate Milk Shake. Perfection as usual.\n\nThumbs up to this mass-market marvel. Carry on Red Robin - go forth and spread your message of beefy goodness!"
1,Pretty good my lady and I have tried all the places around val vista lakes area and decided to give them a shot. Very good and not bad in priced. Will go back again. Had the orange chicken and egg rolls great flavor.
0,"I'm not a troll. I don't usually make bad reviews, but today was a bad day in Starbucks of the Arizona Mills Mall. I waited in a slow moving line of only 3 people in front of me. By the time it was my turn, I ordered a blended chai tea latte. I would have gotten something to eat, like the double chocolate brownie, a berry coffee cake or even a banana bread. They were out of everything, except for carrot cake, which I don't like. Next, I waited twenty minutes for my drink. You know what? I paid $5.36 to wait for my drink to get to me eventually, and that is unsatisfactory! Also, slow wi-fi. If you're going to provide slow wi-fi, you may as well cancel it!"
1,"This establishment is located in the Paris hotel, across from Bellagio. High volume is during the weekends for dinner. PLEASE try to make a reservation during the times of Christmas, NYE, and Valentines Day season. It will be very hard to get a walk-in. There is also many sections of the restaurant to be seated at. First room is the wine room, which is midly dark. Chose this room if you are there for drinks or for 'intimate' time. One problem is that it is near the front where people are walking in and out constantly. There is outside seating available, which faces the strip and Bellagio fountains. It is both good and bad, since some annoying tourist might bother you while you are eating. But the fountain show is wonderful to watch while outside. There is also a room that is inside but right behind the patio, so you get all the ambiance of the patio but you are technically inside.\n\nI believe I have eaten here four times. \n\nThe first time was with a friend for lunch and both the food and service were excellent. We were walk-ins on a Saturday during lunch. We were seated outside facing the bellagio fountains, which was beautiful.  I had clam soup, brie & garlic, Shrimp Gabi and escargot. We also ordered the Pinot Gris, which was excellent with the meal. The price was reasonable for the quantity and quality of food we had (the bill came to about $120US). Everything was flavorful and fresh. Based on this meal alone, we would highly recommend this restaurant.\n\nSecond & third time was with my friends (who are yelpers as well). The third time, we sat in the room behind the patio (since it was hot outside).  I basically ordered all the same things from the first visit and it tasted just as good. These times, were had ordered dessert, which was a vanilla type of milkshake. It was incredible. \n\nFourth time, I will say I was disappointed in both the food and service. Perhaps cause one of the individuals with us was a friend of the assistant manager, and it seemed that we were being ignored or just not waited on as well as others there. The service at lunch was erratic and inattentive though the restaurant was not that busy than it had been at any of my previous meals. I wanted to try their Quiche and was not impressed. It was dry with very little flavor, and bland.  My boyfriend's meal was no better, which I believe was a steak of some kind. It was pretty dry. Even though we did not pay for this meal, the value was not nearly as good as the value the past few times. \n\nFrom my experience I would still highly recommend the restaurant. I have been to more expensive French restaurants and this place is honestly great for the price. Just do not be discouraged from one bad meal. I would say that  is a great ratio."
0,Are meal took along time and when it finally came they got are order wrong and acted like it was are fault. And the cheeses burgers we ordered were bland and nothing special. I dont think I would have a reason to go back.
0,"Take a sports bar, serve eh-ok mexican food and fill the room with testosterone and let the ladies loose!  This place was a way too frat boyish for our tastes and the food was not that great. Over crowed with tables as large as basketball courts. I could never hear the server or the person across the table speaking."
1,"So I finally check this place out after living here for about 3 years and I admit, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nBrought the wife and kids here for some \""family time\"" on a cool 60 degree saturday. When we got there, we find out that to just walk around and visit certain parts of the venue is free but you still have to get admission tickets from the gate. I was told this was for attendance reasons so they know just how many people overall are visiting. \n\nUpon admission, you are given a map of the whole park. To be able to visit certain buildings is when you have to pay. Some people pay by accident not understanding that their intent was to only go to the places that are accessible with no charge so make sure to let them know what exactly you plan on doing.\n\nSo that's what we did. We decides to just explore for now. Lots of good hang out spots from a childrens's playground to a decent garden equipped with hands on exhibits. They have benches scattered all around for you to rest and just hang out for a minute or two so that was pretty thoughtful of them. I thought it was kind of cool you can rent bikes and ride them on the specially designed trails.\n\nFrom my observation, this is a nice place just to hang out and walk around, especially when it's fall, winter, and spring. I wouldnt recommend doing this during the summer when it's triple digits. If you're a photographer, this is a good place to hone your skills and get a lot of beautiful photos with the wide variety of backgrounds to choose from.\n\nNext time we are thinking about getting a season pass so we can explore the museum and some of the other buildings that have planned activities in them.\n\nIm glad me and the fam checked it out, because now we know we can come here on those days that we have nothing to do but keep our selves company and there's nothing better than having some good quality family time here at the Springs Preserve."
1,"I have lived in Vegas for 5 years and have had a lot of trouble finding a hairstylist. After many hair salons, I decided to try the salon at South Point. So far this has been the best hair cut I have received in Vegas. I think they have reasonable prices and if your a local, it's even better at 20% off. After receiving a salon treatment, guests are able to use the spa and fitness center free of charge. So its like an all in one beauty hot spot."
1,I love the atmosphere here.  Although I would say it is easiest to just hope into a set at the bar and get full service then going through the line.  Their Sea Salt Caramel milkshake is yummy.  I finished it before I even got my burger.  I got a veggie burger with a gluten free bun.  I felt like giving it a shot even though I love me some beef.  It was delicious although the gluten free bun was a little flimsy.\nMy husband got their mushroom swiss burger and fries which he polished off with no problem.  He would go back anytime and that is saying a lot.  He has high burger standards.  I would recommend it.
1,We love this place.  We do miss the lunch hours though.  We have always had good service and sushi is great.  If they bring back lunch I would definately give them 5 stars.
1,Fun friendly servers and pretty good food! They are known for burgers but their salads are really good too!
0,"I was dying for some drunken noodles, saw this place close and gave it a go.  They open at 11, I tried 1058, no one there realized how early and killed time at the dollar store, came back at 1114, still not open, started to leave and someone ran to the door to unlock it, still had her purse on so I know she just walked in the door.  I ordered takeout drunken noodles and asked how long it might be since I know they just walked in, 5 min.  I didn't know whether to be happy or scared.  How could that be ready in 5 min? It was obvious they took old stuff and just re fried it, pretty greasy and nothing tasted fresh.  I am not one to know authenticity, but I had some drunken noodles in San Diego that I am trying to find something similar here.  This is my 3rd round with the noodles and just a few other times eating Thai apart from that, but this was my worst for sure out of all of them.  I don't know Thai food real well, but I know fresh, and I didn't get anything fresh here.  Also, smelled like old lady moth balls"
0,"It is the first time I gave 1-rated review, while I normally gave 4-5 stars regardless of service quality. The worst service came from TWC. Took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done. All they did is to transfer the phone call to another representative after telling me \""I can't do this, I can't do that\"". Worst service ever!"
0,So disappointed.  Didn't know menu is different on weekdays - was so looking forward to eat crab legs.  The buffet choices use to be better - so few things available.   Dessert items are still delicious.
1,Good place to study and have a nice drink. They also have Ramen in case you get hungry. I have not tried it but may next time I go there.
0,"Went for lunch. As with any Vegas buffet, the quality of the food is a gamble, and not one you're very likely to win. Sadly, this one counts as a big loss.\n\nAside from the typical decor, it doesn't even feel like a restaurant. Plates and utensils are washed en masse, resulting in eating surfaces that look like they were simply sprayed with a hose and dipped in sanitation solution. In other words, everything looks dirty.\n\nThe food is awful. There's really no other way to put it. Looking at positive reviews, I can't for the life of me understand how anyone could eat this stuff with a smile. Maybe low prices are intoxicating their sense of judgment or they have the perfect combination of deadened taste buds and iron stomachs. The only other buffet I've been to that's worse than this one was at Sante Fe Station, and that one induced vomiting.\n\nOne can't help but shake the feeling this is the foods last chance at being served. Most of the options appear to be right at the borderline of expiration, or at least of the lowest quality. There are seven sections: BBQ, American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, Dessert and the Salad Bar. Don't even think about seafood, because there isn't any. I did my best to try a bit of everything, but it was tough finding anything appetizing from the Asian or Mexican areas. They don't even look right.\n\nMeats are profoundly dry, akin to soft wood. Vegetables are fresher than anything, but the taste of the cooked ones manages to be awful as well. Fruit amounts to little more than watermelon. Meanwhile, you have a bountiful selection of breads. Great. And don't forget dessert. It rounds out the stomach cramps nicely. Though to be fair, they do have a gelato station that sticks out like a sore thumb in a place like this.\n\nI can handle a bad meal as much as anyone, but this stuck with me the rest of the day, assaulting my stomach with night terrors. The single thing I can honestly say I enjoyed was a potato. I implore anyone with a mouth to go anywhere but this people trough. Even from a financial point of view, the food court will satisfy more for the same price."
1,"The location is great, clean, friendly and seating for 25 or more. I ordered Honey Habanero and Hot chicken wings, with a side of Fried Mac & Cheese bites. The staff was very friendly answered a few questions and delivered my food with a smile. \n\nThe wings smelled delicious. The aroma of the traditional Hot is one of my favorite food associated smells. The HH wings had a complex mixture that begged investigation.  The flavor mixture of Honey and Habanero was a real treat. Not too spicy but smooth to boot.\n\nFor people on the East Side of the Valley this is worth a stop. No hesitation making the recommendation here!"
0,"Our reservation was for 9pm and we were not seated until 10pm. This seems to be standard operating procedure for them. We first waited for 10 mins to check in with the hostess. She then adds you to a list and gives you a pager - like other restaurants do when  you don't have a reservation. \n\nSure, they brought out complimentary calamari for an appetizer after we were seated, but that wasn't enough. They didn't seem to really care or apologize about the wait. At one point a manager stopped by for a quick check as we were eating dinner and we did complain about the wait. He said he would send over a round of complimentary drinks/shots,but that never happened. \n\nThe food was good, but nothing special. I do have high standards for restaurants as I live in Chicago and am spoiled by the food scene here.\n\nPotentially all Vegas restaurants don't care about service because they have a captive audience - I don't know - but this one certainly doesn't.\n\nThe ambiance was fun - great decor, music. However, it was freeeezing with the AC. We were dressed to go out to a club after - no sweaters or shawls, but if you can, bring one. We were literally shaking throughout dinner but they said they couldn't change the temperature."
0,"High prices for small amounts of food. My mother and I ordered the mussels and the kampachi sashimi for appetizers to split, I had the monkfish for my entree, and my mother had the vegetarian special (couscous salad with tofu scramble on top). We expected with ordering all of those things that we would leave with leftovers but not even close.  The bill was $91.  It would be one thing if the taste of the food was outstanding but that fell way short also. The mussels were bland and boring, the sashimi was so small in portion size that we were turned off to it from just looking at it, the monkfish was way over salted, and the couscous salad was very bitter from what seemed to be a vinegar-y dressing of some sort. We will not return."
1,"I love saving money!!  I was just browsing, and I did not expect to buy anything.  I found a deal that I could not pass up though.  I think that they normally have a buy 1 pair get the 2nd pair for half price.  I was able to get a pair of shape up shoes for $39.95 and a second pair of shoes for $14.97 (Orig. $44.95)!!  \n\nI used my shoes to go hiking at Red Rock Canyon later that week.  I haven't used the shape ups yet.  I probably won't need another pair of shoes for awhile....but if I do, then I will definitely go by here again."
0,"The selection of spirits was not inspired. I was intrigued by the idea that I could sample some craft beer and get a growler, especially since it was 107\u00b0.  This turned out not to work so good.  The proprietor asked if I was looking for something, and I said no, I was browsing.  Which I did.  Since I didn't see anything else interesting, I went over and read all the info on the beers on tap.  Then I read them again.  Since the guy was sitting and laughing with a couple ten feet from me, I figured he'd ask if I wanted something.  Nope.  Guess they sell enough $35 growlers that they don't have to worry about selling another one to an out-of-towner.  Maybe the store is kind of a hobby operation, though it seems like an expensive one.\n\nI should have just butted in to his conversation, but I was feeling kind of Midwestern.  I noticed the other day that Total Wines has growlers too, but they have people that ask what you want, and they have quarts as well as half gallons, which is more attractive in some cases.  I'd have given these guys three stars on their selection and they could've earned another on the service.  Instead, they lost one."
0,"If possible, I would give A Perfect Sole zero stars...and I never even had a chance to visit the place! I purchased 3 certificates for a \""relaxing express pedicure\"" from WeeklyPlus.com, one for myself and two as gifts. Since the purchase date, I have repeated attempted to call and schedule appointments, alternately leaving messages for Toni (the owner) or hearing that she was so busy but would call me back in \""10 minutes\"". I've never received a call back and, when she did pick up the phone during my calls, she was pretty rude. One friend who received my gifted certificate was finally able to make an appointment after repeated calls, but has said that the woman she spoke to was rude and even a little scary. I'm ashamed that my gift has turned out so poorly and have even asked my friend to cancel her appointment and I'll give her a pedicure at a different salon.\n\nWeeklyPlus.com said they've received lots of negative feedback about A Perfect Sole and were willing to refund my account for the unused certificates. Also check out the guest book on the company's website for more comments about customers' poor service experiences."
1,"Juan Taco is the first Charlotte-area food truck I've tried, and I was very impressed! I got a chicken burrito with a side of rice and beans. The chicken burrito was generously sized, and very flavorful, however, the sides left something to be desired. The beans were not refried, just regular ol' pinto beans with cheese, and the rice was just okay. My husband loved his three chicken tacos, and my son also got a chicken burrito (which he loved as well). Pricing was very reasonable, and I love the look of the truck! All in all, despite the bland sides, a very good experience! I will definitely try them again!"
1,"I took my wife here for a surprise birthday getaway, and selected this place entirely based on Yelp reviews. Man, did I score. As hotels go it doesn't get much better than this, at least not in this lifetime. It certainly helps that this place is new and has opted for subtle elegance rather than the gaudiness that characterizes so much of Vegas. I love that you don't have to walk out of the place through a casino. The level of service we received was exceptional. For the trip to the airport we were picked up by one of the house Mercedes Benz wagons. Our driver Mongo couldn't have been more helpful. On arrival hotel staff greeted us at the door and (!) walked us up to our room and personally checked that everything was in order and educated on the fantastic multimedia controls that work on everything from the curtains in the room to the 'alarm clock' (which gently opens the curtains at the time you select, a nice touch), to viewing and managing your bill from the TV.\n\nIn terms of location this place is in exactly the right spot, between the Aria and New York. And on the New York side there is a Wallgreens with anything you need (but alas, at LVNY strip prices).\n\nI didn't partake of the on-site restaurants but my wife did and raved about everything, from the pork-belly skewers in the bar to the fresh squeezed watermelon juice at breakfast.\n\nOther folks have complained about having to go up to the 23rd floor to check in and then every time you go from your room to the outside, but it's because the architects obviously had security in mind when the place was designed. I for one am happy for an extra layer of insulation level separating us from the seediness that is the Las Vegas strip."
0,If pretentiousness is your cup of tea this is the place.  Beyond that it's hard to see any attraction.  You'd think hoity-toity would be better quality.  Pedestrian premiums hardly justify pricey airs and attitude.
1,"When I visit new restaurants for the first time, I typically find one or two things that make it less than a five star experience. In this case, I could find no flaw. One of my fellow diners made a special request which they did without question. I had the cheese burger and fries. It was fantastic. All who dined with me for lunch enjoyed their food. It was a great atmosphere and they have free wifi which was needed for the meeting we were having there. Definitely worth a visit!"
0,"Horrible!! But I guess you get what you pay for. Every other casino on the strip was booked. Thought this one would be decent...wrong! The steakhouse was amazing. That's the only reason I gave it one star. We'll never stay here again. Rooms are totally outdated. Very dirty. Room was nonsmoking but totally smelled like stale smoke.  Not even a clock radio. If you want a refrigerator, they'll bring you one, for 25 bucks a day. If you want internet,(included in the resort fee) they'll bring you some cord, I guss. No wifi. This place sucks!"
1,Locals only...I love this place!  Super warm environment.  Kind of that Cheers vibe - everyone knows your name.  Best Bloody Mary offerings around.
1,"When I heard that Moe's had opened shop in the EpiCentre I had to give it a try.  I am a big fan of Moe's.  There are plenty of what I call the \""Big Giant Burrito\"" places, but here is why I think Moe's stands out above those others.  They give you free chips and salsa with your BGB.  They have 5 kinds of salsa including a tasty tomatillo salsa which is my favorite.  Less than a week old this Moe's was running fairly smoothly.  The line for food was 3/4's of the way to the door, but it moved quickly.  The staff assembling the BGB's did a good job of moving the line along.  \n\nHere is the one bad thing about this location.  The cash registers, salsa bar, drink machine, lid & straw station, etc, were jammed into a corner that has a support column right in the middle of it.  The 100 flavor coke machine didn't seem to be holding things up too much, but salsa bar, lids & straw station did cause a bit of a traffic jam. I was able to get my food, drink, & salsa, find a seat, eat and get out in about 40 minutes.  \n\nSo even though it was busy it wasn't too bad to get in, eat and get out.  Moe's is great and the layout works well except for the corner of delay."
1,"I would have never known this place existed- but I found out about the greatness that is Fuego Tacos through a HomeRun offer. The chips and salsa were stellar, and I tried the pernil taco and the carne asada. I preferred the carne asada. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other tantalizing tacos! I also had a great drink with Jack Daniels! I will definitely be coming back. \nNOTE: You must remember to have Fuego validate your parking, or you will be charged."
1,"Great relaxed downtempo atmosphere.  Hip and classy while casual and unpretentious.  Impressive selection of beers, but nothing local.\n\n\""Blasted brussels sprouts w/ arrugula pesto\"" sounds great, but were too bitter, hard, and oily.\n\n\""Pesto brie french fries\"" were fabulous, but needs more pesto and Brie (and less oil) for a plate of fries that huge.  This is NOT a small side plate."
0,"Beware - they lie! I've never used scuba equipment before, and they are supposed to be the experts. They are only experts at taking your money. You can not return any items. Too many people in the class. We had 2 people quit because they couldn't get assistance."
1,"The best thing about Isabella's by far is the beautiful atmosphere as there is plenty of outdoor seating facing out into the gorgeous golf course. We were able to sit on one of the couches on the patio with a fire pit - highly recommend! \n\nOur server was super-friendly and was extremely accommodating to my gluten-free diet. While they do not have a separate gluten-free menu, he went back and verified with the chef what substitutions they could make to get me a GF meal. I was able to enjoy the Green Beans as an appetizer and the Kale salad.\n\nThe green beans were AMAZING - and the kale salad was really tasty and fresh as well with grapefruit and orange, roasted almonds and vinaigrette. They were able to add some grilled chicken to give it more substance too. The salad portion was HUGE - I kept eating it for over an hour and yet still barely made a dent.\n\nThey have a rooftop which looks pretty neat - would love to return here at night & see the stars & Phoenix lights."
0,"Awful service awful food. So disappointing, other locations are significantly better."
0,"This review will help those who are considering getting a table.\n\nI made reservations for a table with the club days ahead. \nGetting a table has its advantages. Don't have to wait in line and you have a place to sit an lounge plus room to dance.\nThe table they sat us at was upstairs. \nI would not recommend one of these tables. You are totally cut off from the crowd and the dance floor. \nAfter about an hour we noticed the table next to the girl flower tub and dance floor was available. We had them relocate us to this table. \nWhich was quickly and easily done.\nThe location was great.\n\nOk now for the reasons I gave this club a one star.\nThe pricing of the bottles was grossly overpriced. $650.00 for a $50.00 bottle. Thats really ridiculous.\nOne of the biggest problems I have is the girl that was hosting our table.\nShe was talking to me with a stripper personality. She was asking me where I was from. Once I said LA she continued to ask me if I wanted to get together next time she is in LA. I was there with my girl friend. The hostess didn't care and kept talking to me to get my contact info.\nI felt this was totally unprofessional.\nWhen I payed the final bill, she was persistent that she get my contact. I still rejected her.\nThey automatically put gratuity on the bill. I Ok'ed it and then gave her additional 100 dollar bill. She then said to me that she has to share the tip with the fellow that was helping clear our table. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. \nI asked her; \""I am sorry, what was that?\"" \nShe said again that she has to split the tip. I was in shock.\nI just turned away. \nVery unprofessional.\nAfter that I knew that these employees are trained to treat their customers and squeeze as much as you can out of them. This girl was hitting on me only to try and get more.\nAfter the night was over I had spent $4000.00 on the tables.\nWe left at 3am and some of our friends wanted to stay. \nAfter we paid our bill and left, the staff was very rude to my friends and before the club closed I found out the next morning that my friends were kicked out of the club for reasons that are not acceptable. They were only dancing in the seated area and talking to girls and gave my friends problems. One of my friends was actually pulled to a secluded back room. Once they found out that he is a police officer, all my friends were ejected from the club.\nI think they had some other kind of plans for him by bringing him back to that room.\n\nAnother situation that happened during our time was that this party was all for a friends 21st birthday party. My friends parents had joined us. Now my friends parents are a little older, but they have every right to be there.\nHis mother was talking to the girls in the tub and one of the girls said to her.\n\""Why are you here lady, you're too old to be here\""\nShocking!\nMy friends mother pretty much told her off and the girl in the tub struck her with her fist.\nSecurity came over and pulled the girls from the tub. \n\nI agree with all the other reviews.\nThe club was over crowded.\nThe club was very hot in temperature.\nThe line outside was very long.\nYes, being a guy. I had to wait in line to use the bathroom. \n\nWould I recommend this club? Absolutely not!\nI would recommend going to Tryst or XS.\n\nI think the biggest problem with this club is the management.\nTraining their staff to try and squeeze as much as they can from their patrons."
0,If it is important to do to make your flight by relying on an airport shuttle do not stay here.     \n\nI thought the 45 minute wait for the shuttle last night at the airport to get here is bad this morning is ridiculous \n\nI was in the lobby at 915 waiting for the 930 shuttle when I was told there would not be one till 10 am.  Well I just  watched the 10 o'clock leave  at 950 with one person on it with 8 of us still sitting in the lobby.   \n\nThe girls said they will be at 10:15 now.   \n\nWhy is it supposed to run every half hour we need to get the airport to make flights. \n\nThis is ridiculous I don't know who manages here but they have problems.
0,"**Hotel and Restaurant review**\n\n\n\""There are cockroaches everywhere its the desert.\""\n\""Our system had a virus, so it charged your deposit twice.\"" (two different amounts.)\n\nWe got there and the first thing I noticed about my room was the stains on the sheets. The second thing I noticed was the cockroach on the wall of the bathroom. I just got in and I was tired and I thought \""well, whatever. I'll sleep in my clothes and tell the manager in the morning.\"" So that's what I did. I woke up the next day to shower and complain, and there was soap in the shower. Used soap. Used soap that wasn't' mine, in the shower. \n\nI went and told the supervisor on duty and he told me \""This is the desert. there are cockroaches everywhere.\"" Uh, OK. It was only one, and I'm a push over. Then he told me \""go ahead and enjoy a free meal at Dupars. Just charge it to your room. I'll have housekeeping go to your room first.\"" It was breakfast and I was hungry so that sounded like the perfect solution. \n\nSo we sat down at the table and ordered a sprite and a coffee. The sprite had no syrup in it, so I explained the issue and asked for a water. My fiance got a coffee. When he poured the creamer into his coffee there was trash in the creamer. I can't say that OBVIOUSLY this creamer was at someone elses table at one point, but I'm going to toss that out there as a high possibility. We complained to the waitress and asked for a new coffee. She tried to charge us for 2 coffees. \n\nAnyway, we fixed our bill (just in case) and charged it to the room. So far so good, I just got back yesterday. I still haven't' received my deposits back, so we'll see how that goes.\n\nA few other things that bothered me, but not enough to have their own paragraphs: The TV didn't work the whole time we were there and I had a horrible view.\n\nSo why 2 stars? The front desk girls seemed to care about everything I brought to them. Good customer service in that sense. \n\nIt seems like they put all their good people over at The D down the street, also owned by the same guy I guess. I have no intention of staying here again. Maybe I can find a place downtown that doesn't' have cockroaches?"
0,"Went to Downtown Summerlin and was excited to try out this truck since I enjoy Mediterranean style food. As my friend and I were looking through the menu, the first impression I get from the young server is a rude complaint to the cook. Okay, whatever that's fine, I guess. As I am ordering my food, she is still busy complaint/fighting with the cook that she had me wait a bit for her to finish and get back to me. \n\nAs we get our order, our fries were the biggest disappointment. It was over cooked, drenched in oil and it was cold as if it has been sitting out long. It tasted and looked disgusting. When I spoke to a gentlemen that was working there about my fries, he looked annoyed and offended & also made a comment to me saying \""it's fries, it's cooked in oil\"" and when I looked at him with shock of the comment he had said, he tried to save himself by saying \""it's cooked in Mediterranean oil\"". Yeah...okay. After wanting a new batch of fries, he agreed and within mins I was given new fries. It was better but I've tasted better. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed with service and the lack of flavor."
0,"Apparently, under new management - FAIL!!!! Gas and inside store OK and friendly. Stay away from the unprofessional and lazy car wash area. Left me sitting in hot car while chatting with car in front of me. Took my prepaid ticket, but left me standing next to car so there was no conversation about what I expected to have done. I paid to have car washed, inside and out. Been going there for about 4 years and expected excellent job as usual. Gave guy $5 tip and wasn't until I was driving down the road that I realized they never did the inside of the car. I wasn't going back, because they were backed up busy, since they're so disorganized. I'll take the $150 that I spend a month there on gas, snacks and car washes to some place else."
0,Overpriced Hawaiian food
0,"Came here last night post Terry Fator with some of my favorite Yelpers. Kudos for the staff for letting us take over the patio. We were loud and obnoxious, so we all had a fabulous time.\n\nThe only Korean food I have ever encountered was the BBQ; who doesn't like grilled meats? Anyway, not knowing anything, I let the experts order. I for the most part had no idea what I ate. None of it stuck because I didn't particularly care for it. The beef nonsoup dishes were the best, although not memberable. \n\nI found the tastes to be either lackluster, underwhelming, or just spicy. Nothing that really hit it out of the ballpark for me or piqued my interest in venturing into Korean cuisine anytime soon or ever again for that matter.\n\nService was alright. We had to constantly ask for more silverware, more cups, more tea, more almost everything. I think this is mainly because we were the overzealous group on the patio. \n\nSoyo, more like a SOY-NO. Kimchi is not for me."
0,"Having now tried & reviewed almost every buffet in Arizona (about 7 to go, mostly 90+ mi. away), I've been doing updates, & particularly trying to boost up some places that didn't fare well the first time.  This JB's was one of those, so when I heard they were having a \""Special Father's Day Dinner Buffet\"" tonight, it seemed time to wheel back in here & give them a chance to get up to 3 or 4 Stars.\n\nUnfortunately, the \""big deal\"" tonight, wasn't.  There was really good Cream of Potato Soup, & the salad bar was ok, but the hot food was limited to slices of turkey, ham, potatoes & gravy, mashed sweet potatoes, & that's about it.  There wasn't even much dessert, & the whole thing came across to me as really weak.\n\nI had a different waiter this time, but again the table service was amateurish, & the weird architecture of this building is a minus too.  It wasn't long before I was wishing I was at the opposite diagonal corner of this big shopping center, eating at the excellent Great China Super Buffet instead.\n\nI enjoyed my visits to JB's on Northern, & also the one over in Litchfield Park, but this location is just a lost cause.   :-("
1,"Great service.\nFriendly staff.\n\nPricy, but uses plant extracts, environmentally friendly, has no sulfate or paraffin, not tested on animals.\nGentle ingredients that don't irritate my sensitive skin.\n\nTheir unique graphic design and location appeal to me.\n\nMy fav is the Mango Evasion because of its scent and creative design.\n\nI also like their repairing hand butters (not hand cremes), it really works."
0,"Wow... You guys have OFFICIALLY hit a new low! First, you pulled a massively sneaky pete by tricking my fiance into a 2 year contract by offering a $100 promotion (and of course, forgetting to mention that accepting the promotion would mean a contract), then, after visiting the store, and calling several times to speak with your utterly incompetent reps, he finally managed to get the account canceled - double and triple checking that everything was completely paid. Now, mysteriously, several months later, we get a call from a COLLECTIONS agency stating that we owe AT&T money. When we called you guys to find out what the hell was going on - your unfortunate excuses for reps A. Couldn't find the account, and B. Upon finding the account didn't have any good excuses or reasons for not notifying us of an outstanding balance (especially since we made more than enough efforts to make sure that everything was 100% taken care of). Not only did we get a major attitude from not only your reps, but the sassy \""supervisor\"", but now we're also having to deal with some collection agency to get this taken care of. \n\nPLEASE SPARE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE AND NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH AT&T!!!!"
1,This place was delicious!  I loved the decor and the food was really good!  I had the chicken fried steak for breakfast with hasbrowns and toast.  I really enjoyed it!
0,Every time we tried to put in gas it kept saying please visit another pump or pump in use when no one was there or using the pump. Multiple cars have come and gone without filling gas or using the store inside. Horrendous. Skip this if you have the chance. No public restroom unless you are an employee. Fail.
1,"I love this place.  I usually come here since it is right around the corner from my parents.  The pedicures last FOREVER!  The ladies are all friendly and nice, and the massage chairs are fantastic.\n\nI have been here a few times and have had a great experience every single time.  I highly recommend and will come back.  Pedicures are $28, but includes a nice exfoliating leg scrub too, so well worth it, especially since they last so long."
0,"I've been wanting to come here for quite some time now after seeing it featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive ins, and Dives.  The star of the show was the oxtail chili cheese fries.  Which on the show, looked amazing.  The chili cheese fries were made with copious amounts of oxtail and was a meal in itself.   I remember marking my notes with not only the location but what to order (oxtail chili cheese fries) and the cost $8.99.      As usual,  after Guy leaves,  things change.  The chili cheese fries didn't have a morsel of oxtail.  I found a few hair strand like pieces in the chili but that was it.  To make matters worse, the price had been increased to $11.  That's the same price as a burger!"
0,"I feel forced to give this place even one star simply based on the fact that there's no option to give zero stars. All I can say is, my husband walked in there with gorgeous curls that only needed a trim and he walked out looking like The Great Santini. I don't know whether to salute him all day long or what. Ridiculous buzz clip hack job."
0,"I have to start this review by saying that i LOVE cheeseburgers- They are my most favorite thing. This being the case, i have tried many a burger place in my day. \n\nJohnny Rockets is usally pretty good. They are known for having thin, smashed, juicy meat and tasty fries. This is not the case at this particular location in the Scottsdale Fashion Square. This location is always rushed and does not have the same taste as many other locations i have been. \n\nMy most recent vistit was to have a Classic Cheeseburger with well done bacon, side of fries and root beer. Burger was GREASY!, bacon was barely cooked and was mostly fat and fries came out WAY before the food. \n\nI was not as happy as i usually am after eating a burger- this place needs work- they are not living up to the name!"
0,We've gone to this Walmart a few times. On our last visit the store was in such disarray that we couldn't find what we were looking.
1,Good dim sum in Las Vegas.  Prices are reasonable and about the same as Orchids Garden dim sum.  Food is good and they have a better selection on the carts than Orchids Garden.  Only problems are limited parking because they are popular and the restaurant is about half the size of Orchids Garden and there can be a long wait for a table when they are busy.  Never had this problem at Orchids Garden.

0,"Occasion: Brunch with MCT friends \n\nWhat I Had: Weekend Brunch ($41 total) \n\nFood Review:  Was unimpressed. I am convinced that the $41 price tag is mostly due to a premium to avoid the wait. The $35 (before tax) buffet at the Wynn trumped Aria by a long shot. Their asian food was gross: the chow mein was soo salty, the dumplings were strangely chewy/rubbery on the edges, and their fried rice had too much soy sauce. The breakfast food was average. The sushi was maybe TroGro level sushi or similar to Safeway sushi. I was disappointed with their breakfast burrito as well, which was so saturated with hot sauce that I couldn't taste any of the components like egg or sausage. \n\nI will say that the desserts here, solely in terms of taste, were for the most part just as good as the buffet at the Wynn. I had their strawberry cheesecake with white chocolate, and it was delish. \n\nService Review: Self serve. \n\nVenue Review: Although there was no line whatsoever and plenty of seating (chairs and booths), the buffet had to be at least half the size (or maybe even a third or quarter the size!) of the buffet at the Wynn. They also didn't have much unique selection (e.g., the buffet at the Wynn has croquettes and other cool and normally high-value items). \n\nOverall Impression: Unsatisfactory! Aside from the clean and classy decor in the Aria, the buffet had little to offer, especially compared to that of the top buffets on the strip, and especially at that price."
1,Service n decor is outstanding! Old school vibe. Great place for friends from out of town. The name throws u off?? Sounds like a biker bar. All other reviews are on point. Have you ever  had bad garlic bread? It's a no brainier. So if your driving in from California exit early at south point and head north on lv blvd.
0,"2 young ladies behind the counter could not have cared less to be serving customers. 5 of us in line received the same unenthusiastic, practically scowling and somewhat confusing service. Mac and cheese heavily promoted, out of Mac and cheese. Out of soup. Out of raspberry smoothie mix. Out of blue cheese for my salad ... Asked for feta instead, ultimately received no cheese. Nor a fork. Nor a napkin. \n\nPrices are reasonable, that's about all I can say. I'm sure the other 4 customers are also wishing they'd gone to Starbucks. Or S'barro. Or just grabbed a $6 mini bag of Chex Mix and a $4 water at the sundries shop. Not your best location, Paradise.\n\nPS: if I ask for no tomato or onion on my sandwich, pretty sure I don't want them on my side salad either.\n\nPPS: oh look! No cranberry on my cranberry turkey sandwich! The hits keep coming ..."

1,"At the time of reservation we were told the resort fee is included but it was a different story at check in. Last time I was in Vegas was almost 10 years ago and a lot has changed since then. This hotel is really great place to stay for it's price. On an average not fight or big event night it runs around $200 a night for suits. The rooms are really nice with 3 TV's basically in each room. Mini Bar included witch is really pricy and I recommend taking your own drinks and ask for a refrigerator for $25 per night. \n\nThe hotel has a lot of nice restaurants and stores including a gift shop next to the Elevators which is really convenient if you need something really quick. I wasn't to much into gambling since I can't stand the cigaret smell in the casino, even they have crazy air cleaning system running 24/7. \n\nBouchon was my favorite Restaurant which is part of Plazo hotel next door in a short walking distance threw the hotel. It is an amazing french restaurant with great service and hospitality, and atmosphere."

How many people have you written bad checks too?? I for one gave you every opportunity to pay me back the 772.92 that you wrote a RUBBER CHECK for and you snubbed your nose at me. How many more people are you going to do this too?? You have 6 LLC's in the state and 5 are revoked and 1 is delinquent. You are a liar and a bum that rips people off and I for one am not going away or shutting my mouth you need to make it right your nothing but a liar and a thief. I'm not going away anytime soon so do the right thing and pay me back the money you stole from my business and my family. I will press this issue in front of the DA's office being the fact that you have written bad checks to multiple other people, It is a felony in the state of NV to write bad checks and I will pursue this matter daily until I get reimbursed the full amount or you are put in jail! You can delete this and I promise you I will continue to repost on a daily basis.

1,"went here for restaurant week and the service was amazing. They took a little longer than normal to serve our food so they gave us free dessert and appetizer. The food was good and this place looked like a little cabin, giving it a nice homey feel."
0,"My oolong tasted like it was brewed with city water.  Nice that he served me outside by the fountain, though.  Overall Tempe Marketplace is a chill hangout if you don't mind never being able to change the music channel (one of those 'Truman Show' kind of experiences where everything is strangely perfect.)  Avoid the breakfast burrito unless you like overcooked eggs, mixed with greasy spicy sausage (not chorizo, just mystery meat), with a trace canned chopped chiles drizzled over it, and wrapped up.  So a sausage-and-egg tube.  Mercifully not a slag tube of egg and cheese, which is the other variety so usually served up in this grand continent of ours.  If that is what you want then go for it, but it had close to zero flavor so two stars.  Maybe better to stick to the coffee/chai drinks and the pastries."
1,"I have switched to the Paradise Valley Medical Center, Dr. Jason Angle. Everyone at this office is SUPER NICE, helpful, friendly and they make your time there a really positive experience. The pharmacy is located across the lobby from the medical offices (on the same floor), very convenient. The pharmacy workers are all wonderful as well. They have walk-in lab facilities and walk-in shots at certain times of year. Very convenient.\n\nDo yourself a favor and check out this office if you're in the market for a doctor's office."
1,"This is my 2nd favorite hamburger place I have EVER eaten at!... My food is always perfect! I love the pretzel bun! I would strongly suggest trying the pretzel bun! The sweet potato tots are amazing!!! All of the staff I have meet are amazing, the owners are awesome, and the Kimmy special drink is not only refreshing but almost guilt free. I practice out of a clinic close by so I have even had lunch meetings here! I couldn't recommend Rehab Nurger more!"
0,"I'm from good 'ol Henderson and by chance I had to work on this side of town today. Not knowing the area too well I needed to find a nice place for lunch that wasn't a typical chained place to eat.\n\nYelp led me here.\n\nI ordered my food to go, 4 baked chicken strips, mac 'n cheese, 1 BBQ sauce and 1 Honey Mustard. A drink is NOT included with the meal, when places do not include drinks...I opt for the free water. Total was about $7 and some change.\n\nI got my food to go, went to my car to eat and noticed they gave me the wrong meal. Went back inside and they realized their mistake, switched it out, and I went back to my car. I received two honey mustards with my order and no BBQ.\n\nThe food was good for what it was, but I felt like a lard ass after I ate the extra cheesy mac 'n cheese. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll opt for the veggies.\n\nThe male employee with the braces was extra nice though, I'd give him 5 stars on his customer service!"
1,"Authentic dim sum at reasonable price ($22 for 2 of us. We left stuffed). Well seasoned, good textures (not super greasy or mushy as some dim sum can be). We were referred by our waiter during our last vegas trip from bobby flay's mesa grill (trading foodie restaurant tips). This is a locals place. As with most \""authentic\"" dim sum places, there are more asians than other types of patrons.  Also, I've learned that dim sum culture means you flag someone down if you want something (cart or otherwise)... In short:food was good, setting average, great value. We recommend and will return."
1,Outstanding food!!! I'm wicked picky with my Chinese and this is the closest to east coast Chinese I've had since moving to AZ from Massachusetts.  Try it you won't regret it!
0,"Ate there on August 15th at 8:30pm. Not crowded service was good and the BLT was good. Good thing I did not go to the restroom before my food. Bad sewer gas smell in the Men\""s restroom. When I mentioned it to the waitress she oh yeah it's been like that, \""i said get it fixed\""  \""yeah\"" from her. Paying the bill I mentioned it and the lady said we know  \"" I said call a plumber\"" her response \""well it's been like that \"""
0,"My wife and I came here on a Friday night with our 15 month old toddler. Probably won't be coming back, unless they make some changes. \n\n First impression: host and hostess were friendly, seated us right away, got us a highchair immediately, and asked if we needed anything for our child. Off to a good start...\n\nWe were seen immediately by the waitress (Taylor I think) and another girl she was training. Both were nice, friendly, and full of smiles. Taylor tells us their \""special\"" today is a $4 Kona Longboard draft. Thinking I missheard I asked her to repeat that. Nope, their beer special is a $4 draft. That's not a \""special\"" folks, that's just a normal priced beer. On the plus side, however, they had a pretty good beer selection, though with no prices on the menu I think they failed themselves there. It's not a nice enough place for a no-price drink menu.\n\nThe chips and salsa cost $3.75 (which is $3.75 more than every other taco place I've been to in my life), but we ordered them anyway because they came with \""bottomless chips\"" and our choice of 2 salsas from a list of 4 or 5. The chips were light and actually pretty tasty, with no complaints about either of the salsas. That is until we ordered a refill of our \""bottomless\"" chips, and were told the chips were bottomless but not the salsa. Ummm, ok maybe you should have said that upfront. 75cents for each extra salsa. We felt tricked, which instantly put a bad taste in our mouth, even before the mediocre entrees did the same.\n\nBefore we even ordered our entrees, we felt they were $3-$5 overpriced. For example, $12 for 2 corn tacos, $15 for 3 (though it does come with a side). For carb-watchers, they offer lettuce-wrap as a taco option, which we felt was a smart move, along with traditional corn or flour. I got the corn, my wife got the lettuce wrap. Unfortunately, both were so poorly put together that we had to eat our tacos with forks. Shout out to the service, they fulfilled our high-maintenance order of 2 different 2-taco entree choices, each with 1 lettuce wrap and 1 corn wrap so we could split them. It's too bad neither taco was very good (we got the carne asada and tacos el pastor). For sides, my wife got the mexican street corn, which was by far the best thing we ordered. GET THIS SIDE. It's delicious. I could have skipped the entrees and the salsa and just gotten like 5 of these and been happy. I got the jicama radish slaw, which tasted like undressed shredded lettuce and carrots. I saw neither jicama nor radish. DO NOT GET THIS SIDE.\n\nHere's what we would tell the management if they had a \""contact us\"" option on their website:\n1) Reduce entree prices by at least $3\n2) Always offer a reasonable drink special, even on Friday nights.\n3) If you offer bottomless chips (and charge for them), also offer bottomless salsa. Otherwise your patrons will feel ripped off and that feeling will not go away.\n\nBottom line: we probably won't go back anytime soon, but if they're still around in 6 months we'll check the menu to see if they've changed anything and potentially give it another try at that time. We live nearby and would love to see them be successful, they just need a lot of work and hopefully are reading reviews, taking advice, and adapting accordingly."
0,"Service was slow and the food was horrible!!!! With 4 exclamation points. We went through the drive-thru and the handwritten sign says pull forward to order, so we did. The guy didn't come to the window for 7 minutes. Then he asks us to wait another couple of minutes to take our order. At that point we should have left. But I was curious as to see what the rave was all about on the Travel Channel. When we finally get our order taken. We ordered a Pastrami Sandwich and Garlic Fries. Not only was the wait to order long the time to get our food was even longer. Total time 25 minutes, no I'm not joking.\nAs any fast food eating American would do we pulled out the Garlic Fries and took a few out while we were driving away. Yes they were hot as expected. But they were so salty and hardly any garlic flavor. We were expecting minced garlic and to our surprise it was only garlic salt with more salt - YUCK.\nThe pastrami was very thinly sliced but was very fatty. Not typical of \""LA Style Pastrami\"" as advertised. The sandwich roll was hard and not fresh. Could it get any worse - YES, the pickle was not put in a separate wrapper as I asked, so the pickle juice made the inside bread soggy. I do not like pickles on my sandwiches. The portion of pastrami was very skimpy. \nIMO - This place is not worthy of any publicity on national TV. It is expensive and the food is CRAP. If you are in Los Angeles got to the Hat, you will not be disappointed!"
1,"My wife and I enjoy sushi. Of the sushi restaurants in the Champaign / Urbana area, this is our favorite. Their White Dragon Maki is fabulous, as is their Love-love Maki. Those two are probably our favorites, while we rotate through many other excellent choices. The service is always friendly. The experience is always enjoyable."
0,"I have been with them for years. They got so big now its all about money. They cut the service to once a week raised the price's. Customer service is horrible tried to call them yesterday to cancel 11 calls a head of me. Wrote an e mail to pick up containers that I am canceling my service was informed there is a $20.00 fee for the pick up. REALLY its all about money for this company now.

0,"First time at this location last night .  We went late in the evening and had a party of 3.  Got some drinks at the bar which was fine and then sat and waited for our table .  It was quite humid and hot where we were waiting as the air vent was dripping cause the humidity .  While we waited , not one person came to check on us or tell us why it was taking so long to be seated .  We finally were sat a table in the back after 25 min or so waiting .  Took approx 10 min before we had anyone come take our order .  We all ordered fairly simple food and only 1 time did anyone come to us to offer drinks .  We sat for nearly 45-50 min waiting patiently for our food and once we got it , no apologies or explanation.as to why it took so long .   We all had pretty much lost or apatite and barely even 10 min after getting our food , had our server come to us and ask us if we wanted desert (seriously lady ??!?) As we were waiting for our check the manager ( older lady with a raspy quick tone) was across from us , apologizing to another couple that was waiting nearly as long as us , for the wait .  No one came and asked how we were or how our service was or apologized for the delay .  Needless to say we paid and left dissatisfied and upset .  I have eaten at the old town location countless times and have always had superb service and food .  We will most likely not be returning to this location ."
0,"Dont Go Here! Please save yourself the $$$$$$ I got my degree here in fashion marketing. This school is a joke, its all sales they dont care about u they just want ur money. My best friend also went here and is now working for AI she told me about all the shady stuff they do to get ur money. She said since she works for them and knows the bs they pull she would have NEVER went here. All my close friends i went to school with cant even find a job to even pay for there loans. The jobs they send us are for retail....how lame you dont need a college degree to work retail! Two of my friends pay 500 a month for loans my other pays 1200. I only pay interest because my loans are deferred. I'm going to a reputable community college and getting a reputable degree. Oh ya FYI this school looks bad on your resume. i went on a job interview and the lady told me she felt really bad for me that i went there because she used to work there and they are a SCAM!"
0,"I don't get Kohl's.\n\nIt reminds me of a really rundown K-Mart. \n\n\nThere's wrinkled clothes everywhere, they are all piled on one another, then there's like 500 things on one sales rack so things are falling off of it. When you try to pull one thing off the rack it's like an avalanche of wrinkled clothes falling on your head.\n\nThey never have decent sizes for me, most people use like a million coupons and I'm always stuck behind them in line, to buy the 1 thing I actually found.  They have high celebrity names that have fashion lines, but every time I go and look it's like the most atrocious things I've ever seen. Should be something you find in RAVE."
1,"A great Brewpub!!  It is about half way between two of my favorite golf stores, so thankfully it  is very convenient for me.  They also have two of my favorite beers - Kilt Lifter and Oatmeal Stout. Consequently, I am here on a regular basis.\n\nI have stopped by at all times of the day - lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  I have to confess, I very seldom eat here - not because the food is bad - but simply because I am usually on my way one place or another.  What I have eaten - burgers, pizza, appetizers - all have been good, but not outstanding.  However, the portions are large and filling.\n\nWhat stands out are their beers.  Beside my two favorites, the IPA's are solid, and their specialty beers are outstanding.  \n\nAlthough it can get rushed at times, I have always had great service.  My only criticism is that sometimes they do not schedule correctly, and the poor servers are running to keep up.  They do a wonderful job, but you can tell that they have to many tables to serve. \n\nBe aware - it can get busy, particularly at night and during popular games. If you don't like crowds, or just want quiet conversation and drinking, it can be overwhelming."
1,"This place is ridonkulous.  I don't use the word \""ridonkulous\"" often but this place deserves it!\nAYCE is phenomenal.\nWa Salad is some incredible sashimi salad concoction that deserves it's own platform to perform on.  Kid friendly yet posh looking on the inside.\nStanding ovation.  I will be back.  Maybe even tomorrow.\n\nMoved down to 4 stars from 5.  This last trip back, the food was still good bit service not so much."
0,Boy did they drop the ball in the Ribs dept.\n\nAmazing Brisket. HORRIBLE ribs.
0,"I was torn on how to rate this deal. Overall, it is alot of food for a reasonable price-- $44.99 gives you 24hour access to six buffets (in Planet Holleywood, Paris, Harrahs, Imperial, Rio, and Flamingo). For an extra $15, you can now include the seafood Buffet in Rio as well. You can easily spend $20 each meal in vegas (and that's with the lower end places).\n\nThe hubby and I started out around 6pm at the Seafood Buffet in Rio--wasn't impressed (none of the seafood tasted fresh). Then went to Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet at 9pm. The selection looked alot more appealing and the food was more fresh but we didn't eat much since we were already stuffed from the Rio. \n\nThe next day, at 11:30am, we started at Imperial for lunch--didn't see anything appealing (I probably had one tamale with a bunch of their salsa sauces), then went to the Flamingo and had  a small serving of soup and salad (their selection was even less than Imperial's), and then went to Harrah's--they had more of a variety than the first two, but again, nothing too exciting. We finished hoping buffets by about 2pm. We didn't stuff ourselves as again, there wasn't alot of foods that we had wanted to stuff ourselves with. \n\nWe later went to Paris around 4:30pm for dinner. I was soooo very disappointed--their selection has shrunken drastically and the food was sooo unappealingly dry with flavors that totally numbed the palate (Not sure if it was the day we went???). We then went back to the Spice Market and finished off our dinner before the 6pm mark. \n\nWe didn't go to the Carnival Buffet in Rio because we were there last year and had a bad experience so decided not to go back. \n\nI think this is how I would rate the buffets from best to worst as far as selection and quality of the food:\n\nPlanet Hollywood\nRio Seafood Buffet\nParis\nHarrhah's\nRio Carnival\nImperial \nFlamingo\n\nI probably wouldn't buy into this again. Every buffet had pretty much the same items (even the desserts look the same), with all the same grease, oil, fat and butter. I would probably invest in one good buffet (wicked spoon, wynn) and spend the rest of the time eating at local mom and pop restaruants."

0,"Our dd took a few classes like Apples to zebras & Bldg Blk over the past few months. It has been a great experience not until lately. She came home complained about one of the boy bullying her - physically punching her. It wasn't once and twice, it was in several occasions.\n\nWe went to alert one of the main 'instructor' - she said it has never happened before?!  While our dd was literally crying when we told the instructor because she was so scared that after letting them know, that boy will 'beat her up' even worse.\n\nIn various occasions, we went to picked her up and we noticed that the younger instructors were standing around, chit chatting and not paying attention to the kids. It was a BIG class, 16-18 kids in a room with maybe 4 or so instructors (whenever they can get them in)\n\nMind you, they are only \""instructors\"" because they are staff for the City of Chandler, NOT 'qualified pre-school trained' teachers having any kind of certification - at least not ALL of them. We learnt that one of the staff working there was asked to stand-in once in awhile when they are understaffed. That's why their fees are really affordable.\n\nWe coached our daughter as we understand that we as parents need to take responsibility in coaching her how to deal with such bullies, however, we also need to alert anyone out there who still want to send their kids in to be aware that the instructors need to be better trained in this aspect."
1,"Treacle, I have something to tell you. I went to America recently: land of freedom, hope, dreams, and burgers. I ate many burgers. More burgers than I should have done. Diner burgers, In n' Out burgers, epic man-destroying burgers, burger with pickles as big as a baby's arm, sourdough bun burgers. You get the gist.\n\nBut none were as good as your burger, and nothing came close to that special secret JD sauce inna wee bottle you serve up with them. Oh and the sweet potato fries? Not even close.\n\nThat whole song about leaving your heart in San Francisco? Totally doing it wrong. I left my heart here in Edinburgh, and I was home-sick for you, your burgers, and margaritas. Seriously, still the best in town."
1,"Yummmmyy. We were definitely five little, happy piggies here. And everything was great. We just happened to decide on this place while driving back to Michigan from St. Augustine, Fl. We were trying to find the brewery down the street, but sadly it closed! So we went to the next closest place and this was it. And boy. Even though it's too bad the brew house closed, we felt it was serendipitous that we ended up at Mac's instead. Everyone's barbecue tasted awesome. The place was packed and we were seated right away. It was our waitress' first day (poor thing) and she was awesome. We could not have had a better experience. AND it even satisfied our craft beer cravings! Thank the heavens. We loved trying the different brews from around the region. For some reason in Florida, there seems to be a lack of their own microbrews on tap at the bars so we were thankful to try yummy local beers that we wouldn't normally find. The menu is so great too. Weirdly, I felt like something fresh like cilantro but didn't want to miss out on the barbecue, and what did they have? Carnita-style brisket tacos with cilantro. Gold star for you Mac's!\nWe were all really upset that we had to continue our drive North because we could've spent hours at Mac's, we had such a good time. It had us wishing we had time to find a hotel & not have to worry about the rest of our trek. :)"

1,The pizza here is amazing and the owner Mike is very hospitable!! Oh and you must try the delicious desserts!!!
0,"The only reason this place gets business is because it is a Bobby Flay restaurant.  I was not impressed with the food at all.  \n\nI had a prickly cactus margarita (it was a delicious reddish pink color and was amazing) and Hubs tried a mezcal (which is like tequila but isn't).  For starters, we went with the server's recommendation. She said it is the most \""popular\"" appetizer - Tiger Shrimp with Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale and cilantro sauce.  This was SMALL.  There were four medium sized (I think they were smaller than they should have been) shrimp with a tamale on the side. It really looked like the tamale was the main part of the dish and the shrimp were the side garnish.  There was nothing special about the shrimp. They looked like four cooked and peeled shrimp. I was pretty disappointed.\n\nFor the mains, Hubs had the rabbit  - Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbit with toasted chile cous cous, almonds, currants in a smoked red pepper sauce and I had the Halibut with green chile curry sauce and corn and cactus salsa. Originally, this was supposed to be Wild Stripe Bass, but there were some weather issues back East so they didn't get their fish shipment in that day.\n\nMy halibut was good. Nice crunch on the top of the fish and the green chile curry sauce was mild.  I liked it. It was a huge portion of fish.  Hubs' rabbit was just ok - most people don't like the gamey flavor of rabbit, but that is what the rabbit lacked. It tasted more like chicken than rabbit.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the banana cream pie.  It was pretty light and a good way to end the meal.\n\nThe service was ok. At first, the server was very attentive and quick but after we got our appetizers, she was quite slow. Having experience in the food industry, I did notice that her section filled up quickly and she had small tables like us but also parties of 6 or more. She was friendly enough though.\n\nI believe there are better Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  Mesa Grill is known for grilling so maybe the steaks are better?"
1,"I made a 6 pm dinner reservation but since we got stuck o the strip, I have to canx the reservation. Bummer, I specifically wanted to be seated by the fall and pond. :(\n\nMy friends and I decided to stop by anyway since we're going to be at Tryst later. Stop by Wynn concierge to see if they have extra VIP pass, the lady at the desk graciously gave me 4 VIP pass, score (Save $20 admission). My friends were happy that I took them to Okada, the place were pretty and romantic. We ended up sitting by the bar and not the table I prefer but it's ok. We accomplished one of our to do's.\n\nLove their Pomegranate Sangria and Strawberry Flirtini. We ordered Seared Tuna Salad (good portion), Red Miso Bouillabaise (small portion), Salmon Sashimi (yummy), California hand roll and I forgot the other order. 4 drinks and dinner damaged $175. Service were great and the experience I shared with gf's are priceless.\n\nWe'll bring Mr for some romantic dinner soon."

0,"Finding a donut shop in Vegas on a Friday at 9/10pm is tough! I found 2-3 Krispy Kremes on Yelp. When I drove to the address, however, there was no Krispy Kreme. I used Yelp to try to get to a different donut shop, which listed it as being open on Yelp until 11pm. I'll blame that on the person who created the entry. Finally I found Al's, right across the UNLV campus. Donuts were alright. Nothing over the top or memorable. They were just open, and I was tired of trying to chase the \""best\"" donut shop in town."
1,"From the moment we arrived, we had a fantastic service experience.  The wine list is very good, with a lot of excellent choices from California.  They were happy to decant the heavier reds we ordered, and the stemware was well above average for restaurants.  My steamed mussels appetizer was good.  The duo of Berkshire pork was very well prepared, although the portion size was excessive.  The cherry bomb dessert was a little disappointing - the flavors were a little bit dull, and the sweetness overpowered everything else.  We had a fantastic time overall."

1,I support local businesses and this place is a great little coffee/sandwich/salad shop. It's a father/daughter run team and they are very friendly and pleasant people. I've been in several times and haven't tried anything I didn't like. Their cookies are amazing! Atmosphere is cozy and there is a great outdoor patio area as well. You won't be disappointed.

Had an 8pm reservation and we were ignored for the longest time at the hostess desk. Finally seated 30 min later! They actually had a rack of lamb (16oz) on the menu for $68!!!  The waiter couldn't even explain why. Why list was crazy expensive too and not that great. One bottle we had the prior night, was on their list for $38 more than we paid at The Santuary's restaurant!!  Save your money and don't bother going!!!  Service and food certainly did not reflect the prices charged! Very disappointed. Was looking forward to ending our trip with an amazing meal! :("
0,"We came in on a Sunday morning and expected a wait, especially for a party of 9.  But after waiting 45 minutes, I checked our status and host told me there are only 2 tables that could fit us and they were just sitting down.  I told him to separate us to 6/3 or 5/4 and he nodded.  After 2 hours of waiting, we finally sit down with no menus and no water.  Waited another 10 minutes before a waitress came by.  We ordered and 1/2 our party had to run and asked for their food to go, only to find it our order hasn't even been started yet.  They cancel and leave.  The rest of us get our food and it was a huge disappointment.  I had steak and eggs, both were over cooked and dry.  Steak was such bad quality.  Fruit was old.  Everyone's meals were not spectacular and not worth the wait at all.  We wasted nearly 3 hours of our lives on this meal.  UGH."
0,"The bartender is extremely rude and disrespectful. I quote her: \""I don't give a f*** about the customers\"". This place only survives because it is close to CMU campus and there are not many options available. It is a shame that you have to interact with such people to have food here, which is decent. Don't come here if you just want to relax and have a good time after having studied all day."
0,"An open letter to Primp & Blow: I am a real customer. Writing a real review. Stop accusing your competitors of writing nasty reviews, pay attention to what your customers are saying and fix your business. That's how it works.\n\nMy experience at your shop was just all wrong from the moment I arrived--so much so, that even my 12 year old niece, who was also getting a blow out, realized it. We compared notes and here is our honest, genuine review of Primp & Blow. \n\nThe okay: Open on Sundays, decent location, no wait when we were there, Bumble & Bumble product.\n\nThe bad: The stylists were ditzy, unprofessional and lackluster in general. The girl doing my hair actually stopped what she was doing to read over the iPad over my shoulder so many times that I stopped reading and switched to entertaining myself on my phone. She also, while doing my hair flirted with a maintenance man across the salon and hit me in the head with a blow dryer. She loudly and, in an accusatory tone, commented on any flaws in my cut or hair quality but drew a blank when I asked her for suggestions. \n\nThe ugly: My blowout lasted a few hours. It was pretty--that's about it. I paid extra just to have the stylist touch a curling iron for my blowout and my niece's so I did feel completely stilted. To my knowledge, this is the only blowout bar that charges extra for hot tools. The stylist didn't use any product pre-blowout and it showed. Checkout took forever. It was during that time that the woman working the front desk told me her suspicions about a competitor writing reviews on Yelp. \n\nThe bottom line: I've been to plenty of blow dry salons in the valley--this was by the far the worst. All show, no substance. Nice space, good location, lack of talent.\n\nCatherine Thomas"
0,"I think TIM C sent me here to die when he recommended I eat here on my brief stop in Pittsburgh.  I think I got some chest pain eating that sandwich---not the kind from love, the kind from MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION.  \n\nDefinitely a heavy sandwich.  Heavy on the fries.  Heavy on the thick WHITE bread (us health nuts like wheat/whole grain).  I lost the tomato in all the slaw.  Thumbs up for the slaw.  It was not a pretty sandwich and you will definitely not look pretty eating it BUT---worth a try."
0,"A real dump as far as Del Taco locations go. The Bus Stop out front provides a steady stream of degenerates coming in and out. Fairly clean inside and the food was average for a Del Taco, but the service was SLOW. I wish I could type slower to emphasize just how S-L-O-W it really is here. =O)"
0,"I decided to try this school from the great reviews here on Yelp but ended up with horribly bad hair.  I was actually excited sitting in the lobby because there were tons of people waiting. I am thinking score but I hate to say this but when I saw the girl who was going to do my hair, I was like kinda plain jane looking not very exciting. I decided hey do not judge a book by its cover and boy was I wrong. I went in for a cut and color which ended up being 3 hours for just color. I also had to listen to the girl tell me how she was going to be having to take a leave of absence because she is pregnant, how she hated living in Phoenix and missing her family.  It was probably one of the worst experiences I have had and I am calling on Tuesday to see about getting a refund. What really made me angry is that the teacher saw what was happening to my hair and kept giving me this thumbs up. I also expressed my concern to the girl who was doing my hair when she was drying it. She said let me go get the teacher, umm yea the teacher didn't come back and just signed her card off. I was like maybe I am overreacting but after getting the reactions from family and friends I am not a happy camper.  I guess cheaper truly is not better and I am now going to have to pay to get this tragedy fixed. Do not go to this school for color!"

1,"The Big Fat Greek has zesty and flavorful food at a fairly reasonable price.  I have gone here for dinner and lunch time.  The ambiance to this place would be great for a dinner date.  I have tried only their chicken dishes, but it meets my standards in comparison to Greek food in LA.  I usually order the plate, which comes with a delicious Greek salad and seasoned fresh potatoes.  \n\nThe service is very attentive and caring.  I felt like I got water or drinks every 15 minutes refilled."
1,"Went to Envy for the Sunday Brunch.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The selection was smaller due to it being in the steakhouse, but the quality was very good.  The price includes unlimited champagne, mimosas and for Bloody Mary fans, they have a nice make your own Bloody Mary bar.  It was very busy but the service was still good.  Much nicer on the inside than the outside looks."
1,"Stumbled across this board game bar as part of a trip to Montreal. Would definitely recommend it! Staff are very friendly - the board game master knows what he's talking about! Wide variety of games - munchkin, settlers, to less known ones. \nGood prices on beers, nibbles. \nBe aware that you do pay per game to play!"
1,"Been desperately (desperately!) searching for a ramen place in Phx after discovering the deliciousness that is ramen in San Diego, and I was pleasantly surprised when I drove by the \""Noodles\"" sign on my way to a hair appointment down the street at Shampoo Ink.  Made a mental note to stop in afterwards for lunch. I am SO glad I did!\n\nService was stellar - really some of the best service I've had in a LONG time.  Super friendly and attentive.\n\nThe ramen dishes were all pork per the menu, but they were nice enough to sub chicken for me instead of the pork.  DELISH!  SO good.  No veggies like the place I love in Oceanside, CA, but still, the flavor was there and it was awesome.\n\nThis will be my new lunch place EVERY time I get my hair done."

0,"I know you can't fault a casino for taking all of your money. That's like punching a bottle of Beefeater because it made you drink it. However. Treasure Island not only took all of my blackjack money in the quickest series of hands I've ever seen but the dealers have zero personality. Zero. Zilch. Keine.\n\nI will happily hand you $60 if you entertain my pants off while dealing me twelve 14's in a row and I fold on every ... single ... one. I will dance and clap my hands like a stupid monkey while doing it. But since every single dealer at TI sat there like a corpse and didn't even talk or smile while sweeping away my hard-earned chips which I definitely didn't take out of my college tuition fund, then I simply won't enjoy it. Not a laugh or a joke or even a smile. Is Treasure Island owned by Disney? The card dealers are all animatronic. No. No. They're Dementors. They suck the very soul out of you, and there ain't even a cocktail waitress around to help ease the pain.\n\nTI, I rather don't like you at all."

0,BEWARE! Not sure about the stationary half of the store but it's also a USPS. I have sent a phone and another gift through this location and both items arrived opened with nothing in them.

0,"This was the first time I had ever gone to an eye exam myself. I went and was told to fill out paper work and then was given a form. The girl said \""You don't need to read it. Just go ahead and sign.\"" So I signed the paper and waited to go back. After all was said and done, the doctor, Linda Bayerkohler, said she was going to put me in a Toric lens. I just assumed it was a brand. They then tried to get me to spend another $45 or $50 to take some picture of my eye that lets them see behind it. I told them no and that's when the doctor got rude. So I paid $110, which I felt was pretty high for an evaluation, but I paid anyways. I get home to find out that I was charged most of that because of the special contact this doctor put me in. I call the office, absolutely livid. That was when I was told that I have an astigmatism and that I have to wear special lenses which is why I was charged such an outrageous amount. I became even more angry because I wasn't told I needed a special lens. I wasn't even told I had an astigmatism until I called to complain! They then promised they would get me a 3 or 4 months of contacts for free, but the manager would have to order them first. She told me she'd call me back. 2 months later, she still has yet to contact me and every time I call and ask for her, I am hung up on. I can't leave messages and emailing the company has gotten me no where. I am SO past livid with these people and this company.\n\nThese people are not concerned with the health of your eye nor are they concerned with your happiness. They're only concerned with making money and being complete rip-offs. AVOID THIS PLACE"
1,"Fitness Experience is great!  The trainers are very knowledgeable and always willing to answer any questions I have.  My personal training sessions have really brought my workouts to the next level.  I get a program specifically designed for me, follow it for a bit, and then when I'm ready for a new challenge I meet with my trainer, Sunny, for another program.  \n\nThe gym is not over crowded like some of the big chain gyms that I've been too.  I can always get on the equipment that I want.  It's a small enough size that you get to know the trainers and other members on a first name basis, but it's big enough to have all the equipment you need."
0,"To some this is a real AZ hangout.  To others it's nothing but an overpriced tourist trap with bad food.  There's a little bit of truth to both of those statements.  Bottom line... it's a decent place to take out-of-town guests to experience an old West atmosphere and eat fried chicken.  Order any other food at your own discretion!  Oh yeah, the beer is OK to drink as well."
0,"Horribly, nasty vile and those words are just for the bitch behind the counter. The gelato here is just disgusting.. after 2 bites it hit the trash. Also, VERY over priced.. over 8 bucks for 2 tastes.. chocolate looked awesome though tasted like it come from a powder.. sort of like frozen Ovaltine. Also tried the lemon.. it had that weird fake lemon taste.. pretty shop in a pretty hotel. Unforgettably its all window dressing."
0,"I've been to Vegas a lot and experienced many of the top rated Hotel Casinos over the years from The Bellagio, to the Rio, to Paris down to the Wyndham.  Luxor is right near the bottom middle.  How's that for commitment.  The hotel has invested in the places that generate the revenue but not so much on the rooms.  It is convenient to the Mandalay Bay and Excalibur but who cares.  The price was right but I would try Paris next time."
1,"I'm giving the Sugar Bowl four stars with a bit of reservation, but it's worth a visit if you're in the area (I've been twice).  First of all, it's an old fashioned ice cream parlor, which is hard to find.  The menu is reminiscent of ice cream parlors \""back in the day.\""  The grilled cheese sandwich is good...basic and good...served with potato chips and a pickle.  Nothing fancy there, but good.  The menu includes a variety of sandwiches and salads for \""real food.\""   The point of coming here, however, is for ice cream.  A small sundae is sufficient given the richness of the ice cream and toppings, and it really hits the spot.  They have a rather limited selection of ice cream flavors, but a pretty good selection of toppings.  They also have a wide variety of pre-designed sundaes, but I know I wouldn't be able to finish them. The ice cream is really good as are the toppings, so definitely worth a visit!"
1,Had this today for the very first time.  We had chocolate and wedding cake - WONDERFUL!  My whole family liked it.  We are going to have to track them down for more in the future.
1,"I decided to check out this property based upon the recommendation of a friend.  I booked my Tuesday night reservation 2 days before through a front desk employee named John (fantastic customer service) and paid a $50 upsell for a junior suite.  The valet driver immediately greeted me with the statement, \""It's $15 to valet your car.\""  No warm welcome whatsoever.  I asked if he could break a $100 bill as those were all I had on me at the time, and he was obviously irritated.  I stilled tipped him $5 for his bad greeting.  The check-in was perfect  as there was no line at 8pm, and was able to meet John in person.  The room I had paid the upgrade for was fantastic.  Well worth the $50 upsell .  We were told upon check-in, Marssa (their fine dining restaurant) was open until 10pm, so we had started cocktails at Arabesque Lounge around 8:50pm, which later informed us Marssa closed early due to lack of business.  The server at the lounge was fantastic and even brought us the cafe menu (which was also closed), just to give us food options.  We ate a fantastic and delicious  meal there (crab artichoke dip, salmon tacos, and chicken tacos).  The food was so good we took the leftovers to the room.  Overall, great service at the Arabesque Lounge.  Fast forward 2 hours, and after a few cocktails I wanted to have the unusual smoke.  I come down to look for a pack of matches and not a single person on property is able to find a source of fire (although, all involved in the search were extremely helpful).  After a non-exaggerated 20 minutes, a poor maintenence guy comes running up to me with a pack of matches.  I then feel like a complete A-hole, and tip him $20.  Overall, would I come back here?  I honestly don't know.  For every 1 extremely awesome employee I meet here, I meet 1 that is just more like \""meh, I really don't care if you like the place.\""  Beautiful property, half-and-half customer service, good bar food (would love to have checked out Marssa if it didn't close an hour early unannounced), and the rooms are fantastic.  Would love to recommend the place to others, and likely will, but there are immediate corrections that need to be made."
1,"menudo. \n\ndon't be scared. do it. \nyou'll thank me later.\n\nps, make sure you fill up your pint or half pint with all those fresh toppings they have out. don't miss out. do it. saturday mornings."
0,"This bar was extremely dirty on the outside, they could use a power wash. The place looks like it's out of business and their water fountain has no water in it. The inside was under construction while I was there. I wanted to walk out as soon as I stepped in, but I wanted to try the moonshine. I had a beer and some apple pie moonshine, which was ok, nothing special. Judging by the outside and inside I didn't want to eat here. I can't see how this would be a place to go dancing, it's really small compared to other country bars."
1,"Why aren't there more shops like this around?\n\nOn the West end of the Strip is this little Argentinian restaurant called Gaucho. It's easy to walk by without taking notice ... but the wood paneling and the amazing grill aromas will draw you in. They even have fresh rosemary growing in the store to use for their marinades and sauces. There is limited bar-style seating along the walls.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and inviting. The shop is about two months old, so they're still soliciting feedback on menu items and concepts from customers. I believe they are soon opening up their outdoor seating section as well.\n\nThe menu is actually quite big for such a small shop, with everything from sandwiches, to salads, to full entrees available. We decided to go for a Saturday lunch, and it wasn't too crowded inside at all. We asked one of the staff what the most popular items were, and he said the carne sandwiches were the hot item. I went with a ribeye carne sandwich (you can choose from different cuts of steak!), while the rest of the family tried the chorizo and pollo sandwiches. \n\nThe carne and chorizo sandwiches are loaded with roasted peppers and onions, while the chicken sandwich is loaded with portobello mushroom and onion. They all sit on ciabatta bread. The meats were all extremely flavorful and generously portioned. The ribeye had an amazing rosemary marinade on it that just elevated the taste experience to another level. While there are four different sauces you can experiment with in the center island (I highly recommend trying them all), the carne sandwich really didn't need any extra flavor at all. So good. The rest of the family thoroughly enjoyed their choices as well. I really wanted to try some of the grilled vegetable items (OK fine, I wanted to try everything on the menu), but I was full already.\n\nThis is such a great introduction of Argentinian grill food to the Pittsburgh area, and I can only see Gaucho gaining infamy as THE place for an incredibly authentic bite of Argentina."
1,"As an Oregonian, I'm a HUGE fan of our Portland International Airport.

I think either is the lighting or just the atmosphere made it look like an interrogation room area."

0,"I have eaten here many times and have always received the bare minimum customer service required to be considered a hospitality establishment, but the food has always been good so I continued to go. If you have ever seen the Soup Nazi on the Seinfeld show then you'll know what I'm referring to...if you speak out of turn you will be corrected and even punished with even worse service.... if you order breakfast during lunch time you will be given the dirtiest look from the server and even the  cook (even though they serve breakfast all day). I have experienced the worst form of service in my entire life on my last visit ever...I ordered an omelet at 1:12 pm and I was given the usual dirty look, but this time the server went to the extreme by telling the next customer that she hopes they aren't ordering an omelet too!!! The server wanted me to hear her disgust with my order and the customer was very confused even asking the server \""What's wrong with the omelette's ?) Well I got your point and I won't inconvenience you and your cooks anymore in the future. Very disappointed in Michael's management skills in regards to training staff to treat customers with respect at all times. You might have survived in business for many years, but have you actually Thrived? I think the employees, especially the older lady at the cash register needs to go through Anger Management and be retrained in customer- service."
0,"This is one of the worst zoos/aquariums I've ever been to, of the dozens I've visited throughout the United States and Europe. The exhibits are tiny, and watching those animals suffer is just awful.  I will never waste a penny at this place and am glad I got in for free this time."
0,"I am writing this comment within Ichiza as I am waiting for my food to come. I haven't started eating yet, but what impresses me about this restaurant is its wide selection of small appertizer dishes. I can't comment on the food quality yet as the food I ordered has yet to arrive. However, what I can comment is the service I have been getting so far. If Yelp allows me to give ratings solely based on the service I get, I would give this place \""0\"" star. They have to be some of the cockiest servers I've seen, and I can't stand the fact that servers tell me white lies about their reservation status... Gosh, I feel sorry for myself. Highly \""unrecommended\""."
0,"Pros:  Pool area, location, colorful.\nCons:  Rooms leave a lot to be desired, price for what you get.\n\nIf you like this type of retro-hotel, just stay at the Valley Ho.  They do it much better.  The rooms at The Saguaro aren't very nice.  They tried, but there are a lot of details that are missed.  Don't get a room on the lower level -- the only curtains they have are black out curtains so if you don't want people being able to look in as they walk past you have to pull the black out curtain and now your room has no natural light!  This really bothered me!  Just put in a sheer curtain for goodness sake.  \n\nOn our last night a group of 20 somethings were staying next to us.  They had a VERY loud party all night long.  We called the front desk MANY times.  They would not do anything about it.  We finally were able to sleep after 4:30am!!  That was NOT cool.\n\nThe location cannot be beat if you are staying for Giants spring training.  And it's right there in Old Town so many choices of restaurants and bars all right there.  If you want bottled water and don't want to pay $6 for the water in the room, you can get bottled water from the 5 gallon tank in the fitness room - bring your empty bottle and fill it up!  Just sayin....\n\nIf I ever stay here again I will make sure to ask for an upper level room, but I'm thinking it's not likely to happen."
1,"It is what it promises.. a gypsy cafe.  there is a fortune teller there occasionally.  The waitstaff is great.  The menu is always changing.  The food, the prices, and the atmosphere are awesome.  Similar to the Zenith vibe further down on carson st.  Very quirky and interesting.  the hours are strange, but if you can work around that, definately check it out!!"
0,Do not go here I went here and ordered the Chipotle Steak sandwich. It is by far the worst sandwich ever it was chew and greasy . I would not come back!
1,"By far one of the best places to go in vegas!  The views of bellagio and the strip was awesome!  The food was great, and the service was superb!\n     Definitely a good idea to make reservations, this place gets packed!  We started off with the cold foie geas and blue cheese souffle, both were decent but not outstanding.  The blue cheese souffle reminded me of bread pudding, it tasted okay but wasnt anything special.  The cold foie gras was a tad salty even with bread, I think the seared foie gras might have tasted better.   The bread selection was good, I liked the french baguette.  Our bread came out cold, so the waiter gladly brought us hot bread on the spot!  \n     My friends ordered entrees of salmon, sea bass, duck breast, and lamb chops.  The seafood dishes were okay, nothing to rave about.  The grilled duck breast was excellent!  The grilled lamb chops were by far the best ive ever had!  It came out tender, juicy, and had no gamey flavor at all!  It had the texture of a filet mignon and taste of a prime rib, which was quite unique...definitely a great entree!  \n     We ordered two souffles, a pistachio and banana nut...both were great!  The souffles came out hot, super light, perfect texture..by far the best souffles ive ever had!  The banana nut tasted excellent!  The pistachio souffle was also unique, both were very tasty!  I'd come back here just for the souffles..and they are so light that you can eat two of them by yourself!\n    Overall, the service here is excellent, all the waiters are super nice and constantly check up to make sure everything is satisfying.  The food was perfect, but the portions were on the small side.  The souffles are amazing, definitely a must-have!  Prices here a little high, especially for such small portions, but everything was cooked perfect and presented nicely!  This would be a perfect spot to take a date, nice cozy and dimly lit place with a romantic feel, and great views of the strip, including the bellagio water show."
0,"There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""rewards\"" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them."
1,"Pay no attention to the negative reviews! At the same time, there is some truth to this being a small place with limited parking and a postage stamp sized bar.\n\nThe ravioli is to die for - that's what my lovely lady gets every time. I try to switch it up but I'm in a spaghetti rut. The cool thing is you get to choose from about a half dozen sauces. \n\nNot in the mood for pasta? I tried the pizza and it's not bad but... I wasn't thrilled. However, the meatball sandwich? Yum! Good luck finishing that beast!"
1,"Cheap, good Mexican- great if that's what you're craving! Chips/salsa and guac somewhat addicting. Great little spot!"
1,"Cheap drinks, cheap eats...can't beat that when you're near the Strip. Yes service may be slow at times but hey what do you expect when you're ordering a $7.99 steak dinner? BTW the steak dinner isn't on the menu, just ask for it. Yet the staff is always great plus that free brewed beer or root beer is a steal. Now I prefer the prime rib over the steak. The meat is tender and the au jus is quite tasty. By the time, you get your meal, you'll be full off bread and salad/soup and beer. Really for the price you pay, you really can't complain...after all it is Vegas!"

1,"I must admit, based on the reviews I was a bit nervous taking my photos there to be developed, but they seem to be one of the last 3 local, pro camera places left in Phoenix that develops pictures.  Walgreens, Walmart and Target are awful for pictures (I don't have a Costco membership), and I'm one of those weird people who still likes to have an actual photo instead of an electronic image.\n\nWilson's was open on Saturday (Tempe Camera, get with the times, no weekend hours for photo developing?).  I dropped my pics off and they were ready by Tuesday.  4 x 7 glossy, just like I ordered, of my vacation pics.  The quality was superb!  Rivals Jones Photo in Tucson who I used for 30+ years until moving to Phoenix.  Wilson made good pics look even better.  Color and detail were great.\n\nService both on Sat. and Tues. was very friendly and fast.  I'm no pro and can't tell you anything about their cameras, prices, classes... just their photo developing.  I'll definitely be back again!"

It's a little bit pricier for a meal, but I definitely think it's way more worth it than getting a burger from mcdonald's or burger king. Everything is made fresh when you order it, so prepare to enjoy some deliciousness! It's also super clean in there, so I don't feel gross about eating there."

I really hate to give such a place up to the masses but isn't that what Yelp is about?\n\nMy company ordered a combo pan roast and an oyster gumbo, both were great as well! Especially the pan roast! I would have to say that my seafood jambalaya was best of all of them! It had lobster tail, clams, mussels, oysters, crab, shrimp and other goodies! I had them give me a 7 spicy on a scale of 1-10 and it had quite a kick!\n\nI am comimg back for sure!"

1,"Do yourself and your friends a big favor and stay at Encore or Wynn. Pre-pay the night's cover charge ($30 - $50 per guy; less for girls) at the concierge desk the day that you want to go and you will receive your \""golden tickets\"" right there and then. Show the bouncers your tickets and you will enter the club without any questions or fuss. I went with four of my guy friends and it was just too easy to get in. Ratio? What ratio? The \""golden tickets\"" just told the bouncers to shut up and let us in. And they obliged. Haha!"
0,"on two yearly vistits, the doctor was helpful & informative. she seems to try hard in her business. however, on several calls & visits to the office, i found her office assistant, chip, to be consistently short, rude, and somewhat lazy in helping me with any questions or concerns, or tasks (such as faxing my contact lens prescription or helping me pick out eyewear). basically, the doctor does seem to try, but it seems to me that her poorly-picked staff is limiting her practice's potential. basically, my experience here deserves nothing more than two stars because after several frustrating experiences, i finally went to another optometry office and experienced WAY better."
1,"I would love to give a 5 star rating except my mashed potatoes and vegetables come to the table cold. I haven't said anything and even though they are cold they are still good.\n\nService:\nThe staff is friendly and they are great about waiting on you. They are very helpful when your wanting to know what the specials are, which changes on a daily basis.\n\nThe Food:\nFor me I love a down right good home made chicken fried steak dinner. I'm one of those good ol texas boys that loves to eat meat and potatoes. The potatoes are really good and seem to be real potatoes. If they are fake, then they have fooled me. The brown gravy I usually ask for on the side is really good. You can also get a homemade biscuit and that by itself is a meal of it's on. You can tell its homemade. The best part of all is the chicken fried steak. You can look at it and tell the batter is from scratch and nice and crunchy and very flavorful when it goes down the tube. If your looking for a really great chicken fried steak dinner thats homemade with all the fixins......this is the place to go to. Got room for desert? You are crazy if you do. Be prepared for an all time mini pie maybe a 10 incher or less. Either way it's big and they have plenty of different homemade pies to chose from, just ask the waitress. I ordered the Banana Cream, let's just say it was bananas.....no way could I eat it all. \n\nNeedless to say I brought mom here before and I'll continue to go here."
1,"Per my previous reviews of Sew Little Time anyone can tell I am a fan. This time I asked Amelia & David (owners) to professionally embroider my grandson's initials on a stiff/thick nylon duffle bag. I asked that the font and thread color match what was already on the bag -- it is perfect! And it was done lickity-split in time for mailing for Christmas. I have a home-style embroidery machine and was afraid my machine and I just weren't experienced for the nylon fabric. I am very glad I asked them to do it, and I will be back for professional embroidery -- and all the other goodies offered at their store."
1,"We did not make the trek to the east side with The Dhaba on our minds... But as we drove past it to our intended destination, I said \""look honey, that's Dhaba, it gets great reviews and has been written up in Phoenix Magazine.\""  The Main Man replied, \""its Indian, right? We like Indian, that naan bread, mmmmmm.\""\n\nSo we did what we went east to do and decided we had to give The Dhaba a go.  There was NO wait even though we had no reservation.  The hostess/waitress/manager was an absolutely gorgeous young woman who was very much into our learning experience and helped us sound out and pronounce our orders, lamb dishes for both of us.\n\nWe were given water and tea in a more than timely manner and the slight wait for our hand-made, fresh food was well worth it!  MM got the basmati rice and I opted, reluctantly as I steer clear of most carbs unless they are chocolate cake or cookies, for the brown rice.  Both were FABULOUS with the moist, tender lamb.  Both dishes of lamb were spicy without burning and the flavor was FINALLY noticeable... Most Indian food in the Valley honestly lacks heat, kick, and flavor... These dishes delivered in all three.  What I did not notice until it was time for the 'go' box is that the brown rice has the most elegant, aromatic scent.  I may not actually eat it, but I will go to the fridge a million times just to smell it! \n\nAll in all, we were lucky to grab up a table with no reservation, the food was awesome, the service pleasantly solid.  We are just sad The Dhaba is way across town..."
1,"My dad got some free tickets to watch Bette Midler so I decided to take advantage of it (i think i was the youngest person there- seriously!)\nI think I only know one song by Bette and that's it- my dad tells me that he's been listening to her songs over 30 years ago, before I was born. The crowd were mainly older adults and the stadium was packed.\n\nI enjoyed the show, mainly when she was singing the slower songs and when she was talking and crackin jokes. The fast beat songs just didnt cut it for me. The stage set up, costumes and dancers were all great. As for Bette Midler, she is FREAKING HILARIOUS!"
0,"I love it cause its so close to the house and the food was really good. But the person taking the order did not make eye contact with me once. The food took longer than normal. And when I received my order, I kindly said, \""thanks. have a good day.\"" He ignored it and said next in line. No bueno. First impressions are big when eating at a spot."
0,"I expected a lot more from Sunday brunch. I am a Vegas local and have been to several places on and off the strip for brunch. The food was ok at best but not great and not nearly what I expected as far as quality and selection. The restaurant is beautiful and has a great view of the pool. Our service was pretty good but a little slow and the she forgot several items. I was disappointed that we had to remind her several times with each item we ordered and refills on champagne, especially considering that the place was virtually empty. The only reason I have them 2 stars is that the server was friendly and very nice although a little scattered."
0,"Ahh the service here is terrible!! I mean I get it the employees would rather be somewhere else but seriously get a clue. Now I don't want to put all of the employees into the completely useless category because some of the people wandering around the store asked if I needed help, it is the people behind the counter who are completely useless. All I wanted to do was exchange something. There was one person in line and 2 people behind the return/exchange counter so you would think this would have been a relatively quick, run in run out trip to Best Buy. of course it wasn't. Obviously the person in front of me had some super complicated problem so she took a while. I know what you're thinking, just go to the person at the other register. Well I thought so too but turns out her conversation with her coworker who was leaving for the day was much more important so I had to hang back and wait 5+ minutes for her to finish up. Customer Service is obviously not a high priority. Anyway needless to say instead of parking for free because I was in there less than 15 minutes which was my original plan I had to pay for parking. Not cool. Booo to best buy"
1,"Arrived 8:10am on a Monday. Waited 6 minutes and boom, I was called up. Unbelievably short wait! In LA, I would have to wait at least 15 minutes just to get a number, and then wait another 30-45 to get called. \n\nNo line to get a number and a six minute wait to get called. AMAZING.\n\nThe rep was not very friendly but effective. \n\nHad to pay a crap load to register my car but the cool part was that you're able to buy special license plates (for a pricey $60 more). I bought the Susan Komen one--if you're going to spend more, might as well stretch that dollar to donate. \n\nFour stars. \n\nFive stars for fast service\nFive stars for helpfulness (answering all my questions)\nFour stars for friendliness (smiling helps)\nFive stars for parking spaces"
0,"First time i have ever done this, but i felt like i had to. I was in town for a week and while here looked online for good places to eat. Crown and Anchor showed up so we decided to give it a try. We came in on Monday night for the all you can eat. First off they need to update their prices online, for the amounts are different. To get on with the story though we walked right in and were able to sit down immediately which was nice. The waitress was at our table within 2 min or so and we ordered beverages and our food right away. My friends water was there within 3-5min or so, my coke however took almost 20 min to show up. After that it took another 20 min for our fish (keep in mind this was AYCE so the fish should be ready quick. After getting our fish, i kid you not it was 40 min before our waitress even stopped back needless to say we had been waiting and trying to ask her for fish for 20min at least. We talk to her and fish is there then somehow within only 5 min. It was then another 20 before we see her again and ask for our check. For anyone that took the time to read this, i really hope that we were an exception and nobody else goes through this. The service as a whole sucked. The people on either side sucked (relationship fighting, and a guy talking in a terrible British accent). In whole dinner took around 2 hours. The reason this even gets 1 star is that yes the Fish and Chips were very authentic. I will not be going back, but if you are willing go ahead and give it a try."
0,"I have been to Saxby's quite a few times since I moved to this area.  I always walk out wondering why I didn't go someplace else.\n\nI have tried quite a few drinks here.  Their chai is fantastic.  Most things are just average - nothing great, but nothing terrible either.  But the customer service... oh, the customer service!!  It's atrocious.  I can think of one time when it was acceptable, and that is being generous.  Other than that, I always feel like I'm an inconvenience.\n\nAnother thing that reaaaaally bugs me about this place is that their artificial sweetener packets are always filled with lumpy, chunky matter.  I don't know if they are old or got hot or what, but I always have to visit Saxby's armed with my own stash of sweetener.  However, on this most recent unexpected visit, I didn't have any on hand and had to use their packets.  They were crammed in the container and several were actually ripped open from the force of it (ewww).  Furthermore, after a vigorous shaking, I opened my Sweet 'N Low to find that it was one gigantic fakesugarbiscuit.  I don't have this problem anywhere else... just Saxby's.  I wonder if it's because they store them right by the window and they packets are getting too hot.  It sounds like a little thing, but it tends to really ruin some otherwise fantastic drinks when you're sucking chunks down your straw.\n\nI don't get this place.  I really don't.  It's cute inside, but that doesn't make me want to order drinks."
1,"Got an immediate response to my call with follow up. They were on time, polite, got to work. Did a beautiful job. Price was appropriate. I was very pleased and now i can see out my windows."
0,"Not impressed with service and food was decent.  it's a good place for sharing during lunch, though.  don't order a dish for yourself!!  i hate places where you have to ask for refills even on WATER!  we were a party of 2 and a party of 4 sat down 10 min after us, they got their lunch b4 us.  WTF!\n\nthe smoked salmon with capers and cream cheese with toast is YUMMY great for breakfast or a light lunch."
0,"The coffee is inconsistent- not necessarily  bad mind you, just inconsistent. Depending on your barista it can vary from good  (man with salt and pepper goatee) to terrible, strong to weak, acidic and burned tasting to decent. The seating is bizarre, and outlets are sparse. Its not a good place for a meeting, might be ok for a date. \n\nDont buy alcohol here because their liquor license wont let you take it to the games, buy from the culinary drop out instead (confusing since they all seem connected). \n\nOne more note: this place is CRAZY HOT in the summer. Really inadequate ac for phoenix. I mentioned it to a sweating waitress (who agreed) but nothing changed. I mentioned the heat to a guy who seemed to be a manager who just opened one of their cool garage doors- if anything changed it was hotter. \n\nI havent tried much of the food, mostly coffee shop pastries. The bagels are a great deal, scones were dry and muffins were nothing to write home about."
1,"We've been to Hokkaido a few times now, each time leaving full and happy with our meal. There's a decent variety of the traditional Chinese-restaurant fare, which isn't anything ridiculously impressive but probably above-average by buffet standards.\n\nThey do have a grilling station where you can choose various meats and other ingredients, and have it cooked for you. I didn't partake, so can't comment on the quality of this offering. They offered a pretty decent variety of what I'd consider decent sushi by buffet standards that seems to rotate pretty frequently, and includes things from super tame (California rolls) to the fishier offerings (tuna, eel, etc). There's also a selection of things that could appeal to kids that got dragged along and don't enjoy Asian food, such as pizza, chicken wings, and other traditional fare.\n\nIt'd be unfair to leave out their dessert section, which includes all kinds of fruit with a chocolate fountain, ice cream, various puddings, fruit salads... the offerings do seem to change between visits, which keeps things new.\n\nLunch is a bit cheaper (it's what we've usually gone for), but dinner includes crab legs on the buffet for your extra money. Overall, this is a pretty solid buffet that I'd recommend and will certainly return to in the future, but wouldn't go too far out of my way for."
1,I have nothing but good things to say about this salon.  I have been going to For Nails Only for several months.  The people are very friendly and they make me feel welcome.  They do a quality job and don't rush through the work.  I always feel relaxed and happy when leaving.  Thank you!
1,"Chicago born and raised, and even begin to say how much I love this place!! It even smells like home :-) I'm not a fan of chocolate, but every time I go, I have to order the chocolate-cake-shake!!"
0,"We went here to watch a Badger game. Things started out well - we got good seats at the bar and the Bloody Mary was good. That's the one star. Food and service were bad. We ordered the fries for me and a Reuben with cole slaw for my husband. The Reuben, coleslaw and fries came out on the same plate. Annoying, but I dealt with it. \n\nThe fries were awful - limp, soggy and cold. When I asked the bartender about the chef's sauce that was supposed to accompany the fries, he seemed surprised that I wanted it. Um, if it's menued as coming with a sauce, I expect it to come with a sauce... He put the sauce order in and I waited, and waited, and waited. 15 minutes later, I get a cup of mayo with a squirt of BBQ sauce on top. Seriously? That took 15 minutes to \""make\""? By then, my fries were even worse and not worth eating. \n\nThe Reuben was nothing special, but it wasn't bad. The coleslaw were just as bad as the fries, though. Soggy and watery with no flavor. I honestly had no idea that food as basic as fries and coleslaw could be that bad. \n\nDon't waste your time or money here. You're better off at the Great Dane (better beer there, too!)"
1,"This is a 3.5 star review.  Aquaknox sits in the Venetian, in restaurant row.  The bar has a nice seating area, and is chill, without pretending to be a ultralounge.  The restaurant itself has nice ambiance... despite being on a main walking drag, you can be just inside the restaurant and it's not too loud, which is kind of a miracle.  The food was solid.  Again, I'd put the food at 3.5 stars. I had the blue cheese caesar, which was properly dressed, and had lots of flavor.  The tuna crudo and tartare were both very tasty, and used interesting flavors with the fish. It didn't make the fish the star, but it was tasty, and that's coming from a purist."
1,"First time here as this restaurant is kinda new. Just want to clarify it is a Korean restaurant that also serves some Japanese dishes like sushi rolls.  Being that my wife and I are both Korean, we know what good Korean food is, and QQ grill so far has our thumbs up! \n\n I ate a special off menu dish called Dolsut Bibimbap. It is a Korean style fried rice made with beef bulgogi (thinly sliced marinated beef), vegetables (Korean style spinach, bean sprouts, zucchini, carrots to name a few), spicy Kochujang (chili pepper) sauce on the side that you mix to taste (depending how spicy you like stuff), and it all comes in a sizzling hot clay pot.  Becareful that pot is HOT!  It was delicious and authentic.  My wife ordered Ossam Bulgogi which is thinly sliced marinated pork with squid, vegetables, and cooked in a really spicy sauce that is full of flavor (should be eaten with steamed rice).  We also ordered a side of spicy tuna roll, and it was ok.  This isn't exclusively a Japanese sushi restaurant so I wasn't expecting the roll to be amazing, and it wasn't.\n\nYou order at the counter and they serve you at your table.  They have a Banchan (small sides) bar that had Kimchee (spicy pickled lettuce), pickled cabbage in vinegar, bean sprouts, marinated potatoes, and fried tofu with a special soy sauce.  These items are pretty much all you can eat and complimentary!\n\nWe came in with open expectations and appetites.  We left happy and full. The prices were reasonable and we will definately come back again to try more dishes."
0,"Never thought I'd write a bad review of this place.  It's been my \""go to\"" neighborhood restaurant for at least five years.  After a long, hard day at work, I often go by myself for some good food and relaxed atmosphere on the restaurant side of the place.\n\nLast night I ordered a gorgonzola burger. My burger came out with a very mild, yellow cheese on it.  I decided to eat it anyway, as I was starving, but mentioned to my server that I had ordered gorgonzola and gotten cheddar.  I declined a different burger, as I'd already started eating and it was fine, just not what I'd ordered.  She came back in a few minutes to tell me that the chef had told her that the cheese *was* gorgonzola, and that cheddar melted brown and gorgonzola melted yellow.  I respectfully disagreed.  \n\nWhen my check came, I was charged for a gorgonzola burger.  I asked that the charge for the burger be reduced to the price of a regular cheeseburger (about a dollar).  This prompted a visit by the bartender, but no offer to adjust my bill.  There was also an extra dollar charge on my bill, which was either for gorgonzola cheese or sweet potato fries -- I couldn't figure it out, and no one came back to answer questions.  I paid the bill, but they have lost a long-time, regular customer."
1,"Just had my first experience here :) I just decided that I need to be studying outside of the house and this place is perfect for that! \nThe girls working there are so nice, and cleaned up right after a giant group of people moved out. The music and atmosphere is very artistic (totally reminds me of my art high school!) and trendy. \nIts right up the street from my house, and there is never a shortage of parking in this huge complex. It was so nice to just sit and do my thang without feeling like I was just taking up space.\nI will for sure be here twice a week every week from now on :D"
1,"How have I not reviewed Edinburgh Castle yet, considering I see it every day, from several different angles? it's hard to miss as it sits atop its rough rocky hill, overlooking the city.\n\nI admit, as far as a visiting tourist attraction goes, the fee for admittance doesn't quite deliver the awe-inspiring wonder you would hope. But that comes for free, by simply seeing the Castle.\n\nWhether it's from turning off George Street onto Castle Street, and looking up to see, there, amidst the modern caf\u00e9s and shoe shops the ancient castle right in front of you.\n\nOr as you're walking around Arthur's Seat, and as you reach the top of a small hill and suddenly the city comes into view, there is Edinburgh stretched out in front of you with the Castle standing above it all in the sky line.\n\nOr if you're in the Old Town, at say Greyfriar's Bobby's graveyard. Amidst the gothic tombstones, the Castles towers over.\n\nAnd then there's wandering through the Grassmarket, with the wind and rain blowing in your face and you're swearing under your breath at it all, and then you see the rocky, almost sheer face of the hill with the Castle looming right above you, and you think \""wow. I'm living in a city that surrounds this awesome, giant, ancient Castle.\"" And I fall a little bit more in love with Edinburgh."
1,"My wonderful husband treated me to a spa day for my birthday and I was thrilled with the package that he selected for me.\n\nI started the day with a Coconut Cream Body Scrub and massage. Quinn performed my scrub and massage and it was wonderful. I prefer to have a male masseuse as women tend to overcompensate and rub too hard. Quinn did a great job and worked out all the knots in my back. Ahhh.\n\nNext, I had a Custom Concept facial. I hate that I can't remember the woman's name who performed this service, but she had an amazing Russian accent. My pores have never been so squeaky clean and the face and scalp massage was wonderful.\n\nAfter having been scrubbed, massaged, and polished, I headed down to the salon for a pedicure. I had the Paradise Pedicure and it was very nice. My toes look perfect and Jessica did a great job smoothing out all my rough edges. :) \n\nI received a full grand tour of the spa and did also use the gym which had a wide variety of machines and free weights. Everything was in good working order and I was very pleased with the service and the spa treatment. I would definitely go back!"
0,"Pros:\n\nEasy in & out\nGood parking\nWas able to request late check out \n\nService review:\nUpon returning to my room we discovered a bug problem in our room. Front desk stated they would give us a call back. 15 minutes later we received a call that they found us another room & a new key would be sent up to our room. 20 minutes later a key arrives. We take our luggage to the new room & discover the key doesn't work. Since things take 15-20 minutes to fix I walked to get a room key that worked. I was really upset since it was 3 am. Seeing the big (what appeared to be roaches) in the room really freaked me out. So I didn't get a good nights sleep. If they were in 1 room I'm sure they were in several.\n\nThe next day I checked my Marriott Rewards Account as well as my banking account. The hotel had taken a free night reward as well as used points as well as charged 2 different credit cards incidentals for the 1 night stay. I was floored. I attempted to call the front desk, but was transferred to the hotel directors voicemail. Eventually I called Marriott customer service to air out my grievances. \n\nI probably will not stay and would not recommend this hotel for anyone coming into down. There are a ton of hotels on the strip. Since I am a marriott rewards credit card and member I wanted to stay true to the brand. I will not do that again when traveling to vegas."
1,"Wow. Fancy.\nI'm a shopper girl by trade so I've seen it - ALL, but I'm still always blown away by the Forum Shops. \nThe layout is a little maze like (as is most of Vegas) but the decor is fun. \nThere aren't too many bridge or better level shops...you're pretty much going couture or you're going home. Seeing Pucci, D&G, Versace and the massive LV store is inspiring though!\nThere a bag and luggage shop called Corsa. Go see Angel for the best service ever. She was really fun and very helpful.\nThe food options seemed limited. There were a few chain restaurants that we did not want to sit down at, so we grabbed a slice and a salad. Not bad."
0,"While it's a beautiful place, we had a highly unfortunate experience here. Though we prepaid for our reservation 10 days in advance, they gave away our room and stuck us in a smoking room, which REEKED. To our discredit, we did check in very late. However, we received no phone call before they gave the room away.\n\nWhen we complained, they offered to give us some ozone machines, but otherwise couldn't (or wouldn't) do anything else for us except offer us a refund. I don't mind that the answer was no, but the manner in which we were treated implied that WE were the jerks and they did nothing wrong. \n\nAlso, when you book a room, note the mandatory \""amenity fee\"", which I really feel is a  sneaky way of saying the rooms are $28 a night more expensive than some us think they are.\n\nI've been in nicer hotels than this, and I don't think the amenities at this location are particularly impressive, so I feel it's just a cheap trick. \n\nThe room was very nice, though I was a little disappointed at the quality of the linens. I'm used to better at these prices.\n\nOverall? Meh."
1,"Hamburgers, sandwiches, breakfast food, pie, how could you go wrong? I admit their burgers aren't the best I've had but  they are good and I'd get them again. I do have to admit that I lived in southern California for a long time, where burger spots like this were ALL over the place, and many of them were very good so it's probably an unfair comparison. \n\nWhat I especially love are their breakfasts. You can get breakfast for so cheap it's ridiculous, between $5-$9 to stuff yourself silly and everything tastes very good. The employees are so friendly. Service is quick, it's seat yourself and order at the counter. I'm really glad this place exists."
1,"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a born and bred New Yorker and know a get bagel when I bite into it. With that being said, this was one of the most delicious bagels I've ever had...EVER!\n\nI was given the name of this bagel shop by friend who had once been. She told me that they're not your traditional bagels, so I'll admit that I was a bit hesitant. The location to which we went was jam-packed but waiting on line was a pleasure. My friend and I were able to watch the bagels get baked in the back, and it was absolutely fascinating. It was like being at a museum, but better - you could actually touch...and eat...everything you saw! I kept it simple with an everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese. The bagel was warm, crispy, and absolutely mouth-watering. It was so good, I was tempted to go back and get another dozen. I wish I had known ahead of time that you could sit down and enjoy a meal here. I would've enjoyed picking some other items off their menu!\n\nPlease, if you're in Montreal, hunt down one of their locations; you won't be disappointed in the piece of heaven you're about to enjoy!"
1,"OK. This is it people. This is why we are here. Right? This is the time of year we phone relatives back home, donned in flip flops, board shorts and Ray Bans. We say things like, \""Ohhhh, I forgot it's 32 degrees, snowing, sleeting and you have dark dismal clouds looming overhead.\"" \""I'm by the pool flipping burgers in my new swim suit I got at Marshall's\"" (ok, I wouldn't reveal that, I would say Saks 5th Ave., but work with me people!). Even though we're still \""struggling\"" with these unseasonal temps (a la upper 80s's), our relatives, friends and family we left behind are snuckering down (did I say snuckering?) in their moon boots and parkas. Us? We? We're still chillin' in our favorite T's, shorts and sandals. The point for this review? Hmmmm. to review us. To review the weather. And the jab at the rest of the good ole US of A. I know Phoenix is waiting for a heartbeat. I know there are newbies who don't get us yet. And that's ok.  I feel the energy of the desert. I feel the energy of a new city emerging from the ashes. I feel the uncomfortableness from this nasty ass IKEA chair on my butt. While I know it's time to sign off and find comfort elsewhere, I just had to say....I LOVE Phoenix and if you don't, go somewhere else, drop the negativity and find your mojo within yourself!"
0,"This place doesn't even deserve one star. My boyfriend and I went there on Cinco de Mayo and we had reservations for 8pm. When we got there they weren't busy but there was a group of 5 that had been waiting for almost two hours for a table. We sat ourselves, had to go ask for menus, had to ask for chips and salsa, and had to ask for our server to come take our order. My boyfriend got food poisoning that night. For being such a fun location and environment, the service and food sucked."
1,We walked today to get exercise and ended up at Five Star tavern and got something to eat.  The Best hamburger and onion rings were very good. The meat was cooked to perfection and the onion rings were nice and crisp. My honey had breakfast with hid eggs cooked just right. We will be back forvsure.
1,Sesame Inn was the place we went when we wanted Chinese food when I was growing up in Pittsburgh. My family owned a Chinese restaurant themselves and when they wanted Chinese food this is where we went. I remember the walnut chicken and the orange beef the most. What I would give to have some. The dumplings were also a favorite of mine too!! Just another place I will be sure to visit when I travel back to the Burgh.
1,"Boardwise are doing a good job competing with the online dealers.\n\nThe stock selection is the best in the city. I got replacement fins for my surfboard for \u00a36 cheaper in here and got my bindings on sale for half price. Everyone who partakes in extreme sports knows how costly gear is, but these guys do alright.\n\nA small, personal problem here. They don't sell Bataleon boards! Criminal!"
1,"I like this shop because they carry raw cat and dog food and I think the price is a little more reasonable than what I've seen at other specialty shops. Also, the staff is really friendly and helpful."
1,"hands down best sushi in charlotte. the fish is very fresh, the chef is great, the sake selection is top notch, atmosphere is pretty good, i had a great time dining here and this is now my go to spot (finally) for decent (what yall would call off the chain) sushi. thank god"
0,"Read a number of good reviews here on this establishment. Last night, my friend and I had a hankering for prime rib so we decided to try Feeney's.\n\nWe arrived and were seated promptly. Drink orders were taken. Iced tea only (my friend has been on the wagon over 25 years!!). Small glass, but was constantly refilled. Ordering was no problem. My friend ordered the small cut of prime rib (approx 10 oz) and a baked potato w sour cream and chives. I ordered the \""Feeney's Cut\"" (the largest, approx 24 oz) of prime rib with rice pilaf. Dessert was fried ice cream. There is complimentary salad bar. Warm rye and pumpernickel breads and butter come with the dinners.\n\n\nMaybe the kitchen was having an off night. Maybe the vendor supplied substandard beef. Maybe the refrigeration was screwed up. I don't know. Let's start with the salad bar. All the usual fare: mixed iceberg lettuce, carrots, 3 bean salad, cottage cheese, cici beans, bacon bits, red onions, croutons, etc. There were four kinds of salad dressings, including ranch, russian and creamy italian. The ingredients were fresh, especially the lettuce. However, the salad bar itself was mildly cool, not cold. Otherwise the salad bar, in my experience, is nothing special.\n\nThe prime rib orders arrived as we ordered them: medium rare. Small plastic cups of horseradish sauce and au jus were on the plates. My rice pilaf was starchy and stuck together. My friend's baked potato was underdone. After trimming off 20% of the meat because one end was all fat and gristle, both orders were a tad dry. There was no rub on the exterior; no salt, no cracked peppercorns, nothing. The prime rib is really nondescript. The fried ice cream dessert was well executed.\n\nThe service was good. The iced tea server (that's all he does, apparently) was working overtime. I'd like to give this restaurant 2.5 stars because I find nothing about this restaurant particularly outstanding. They served us perfectly average fare."
1,Awesome place to go for your vaping needs.  Everyone there is knowledgeable and their recommendations for certain products are spot on.  Reasonable pricing and really cool people.
0,"I wasn't too hungry so I ordered egg rolls. It had a weird taste to it. I had a taste of my friend's pho. It was nothing special. \n\nThere was a total lack of service. There were only a couple other tables at the time. Nobody ever really checked on our table after we got our food. And it was hard to anyone's attention when we needed something.\n\nI've been to pho restaurants with not the best service, but not as bad as here. And at least the food was good.\n\nI will never eat here again."

0,"This casino's breakfast buffet is the same name as the casino it's in... TERRIBLE. \n\n(NOTE: This review is for their BUFFET ONLY!)\n\nAfter a long, red eye road trip from San Jose to Las Vegas (about 8 hours), we were looking for a good breakfast. I had heard that Terrible's had a pretty good breakfast from some research some time ago, so we went to give it a try. \n\nBreakfast buffet for only $5.99? Sounds like a great deal! Too bad the food was a great FAILURE!\n\nThe choices ranged from chicken fried steak to the staple eggs and bacon to chili. None of it really looked appealing. The only item I finished on my plate was the bacon because, well, who the hell doesn't love bacon? It's pretty hard to screw up. But everything else was too salty to eat at some point. The food was so bad that I was even scared of eating the prepackaged Yoplait.\n\nAvoid the breakfast buffet at all costs. Stick to another casino on the strip for breakfast. They just HAVE to be better than this place!"
1,If need supplies for your hookah this is the place to go.  These people have the best quality in town...
1,"Big W is the clearance outlet for all the Woolworths in the area. You can pick up real bargains here. I once got genuine Dolce and Gabbana sunglasses here for 8 quid. They stock loads of clothes, especially good value are the kids clothes. They still have Ladybird clothing, I remember when this was considered a designer label back in the sixties. The toy section is great value and they have a reasonable DVD section. Huge houseware section which has evverything from a tin opener to a chest of drawers. There is a Burger King which charges normal prices. Fab sweetie selection including a huge pick and mix bar. No pharmacy, it's now closed. The massive carpark is full of potholes so take care in the dark.\n\n\n This store will close on 5th January 2009"
0,"We were so excited for this restaurant! Unfortunately, it was very bland. The food starts with interesting concepts but then falls short of tasting interesting. It *all* lacked the ingredient that gives it the kick. Creme De la Creme really needed since short of berry to make it interesting. Gone Shrimpin' was much improved with pico de gallo. Black Magic was ridiculously huge, but it also was missing that kick-- probably strawberries would have fixed it. The tea was good and huge, as was the coffee. The service was stellar."
1,Great place for waxing! They are so nice and professional. :)
1,"Good food and very affordable.  We ordered the wanton soup with BBQ pork, hot beef dish, and roast duck,  we also ordered the guy land dish not knowing the guy land comes one the side of every dish.   The duck is kinda dry but this place is good and fast service."
1,"As you can see, I'm writing a lot of reviews these days because this is my last month on Yelp. Before I split, I wanna give credit to some of the unsung and under-appreciated small businesses in the NW area. DRAGON WOK is one of the better Chinese places that I have eaten at in Las Vegas. And I believe it's even better than most places on Spring Mountain. Summerlin/NW does not have many traditional style Asian restaurants. But places like DRAGON WOK are the closest you will ever get. \n\nThis is not a generic panda express-like joint where food just sits out in a warmer. They cook it when you order it. They got amazing noodles here and the Orange Beef is also really great! \n\nI know that I get a lot of criticism from other Yelpers about how I tend to give \""free\"" 5-star reviews out if the restaurant is operated by an Asian-American. Maybe some of that is true, but you need to realize that I am a 4th generation Asian-American whose family were direct survivors of the internment.  I'm always going to support Asian-American owned small business. But, DRAGON WOK does deserve every star I give it."
0,"Meh...that is essentially my entire sentiment on this place. Spinach artichoke dip was lacking seasoning & I suspect it was canned spinach as it was watery. I got the Wolfpack salad & it was one of the better items from what our table ordered. Did get the dressing on the side & am thankful for that as the BBQ ranch was not good. Tavern burger was terrible- the jalapeno pimento was gobbed all over perhaps to hide the fact the burger was overcooked & underseasoned. The smoked turkey looked like thick lunch meat? One of the better items I had here was the mint on the way out the door. Im not impressed & if you are in the area, I'd recommend driving around a little to see your other options."
0,"I am a brand new buyer and have read good reviews about this company. I called about a property saying I am looking for a house like it (maybe not this one specifically) but that I am looking to move a year from now. I told the lady I spoke with here that I am new to this but had been advised by realtors that a year is a good time frame to start the whole process. (I would like to stress that I am new so I have no idea!) instead of maybe steering me in the right direction, she told me that is wrong, why would anyone hold 1 property for me for a year?! She would advise against that! Obviously prices are going to change within a year, why wouldn't I know that?!, and on and on and on. This woman was incredibly rude, and had a terrible attitude. I wish I could translate in print how rude she was to me over the phone. I then was so frustrated with how terrible her attitude was as if my ignorance had ruined her day that I said you know what? Thank you for your time and before I could finish the sentence she hung up on me. Im sorry I dont know about buying houses, no my favorite hobby isn't going out and buying a house every day. But the woman at this place is incredibly unprofessional if she knows she isn't making money from you, it seems to me. So I guess if you know what you're doing already this might be a good place to go, but if you need some guidance, expect to be treated like an idiot."
0,"Requested a fountain view room in the Augustus tower 6 months in advance and still didn't get it. Currently looking at a bunch of run down buildings inside Caesars. Disappointing to say the least...your \""checking in\"" system for first come first serve views is ABSURD. I can request a view 6 months out but someone who books yesterday and \""checks in\"" before me can get it the same way? That's ridiculous.\n\nEdit after stay- bath tub blowers were broke as well as a lamp switch that didn't allow one of the bigger lamps to light. \nAlso was unaware that the resort fee doesn't include wifi as we were tried to be charged $15 per day for wifi! This was free for us when we stayed at the Cosmo 2 days prior to this stay. We'll definitely just be staying at the Cosmo for our whole trip next year."
1,"Best Mexican fast food in the valley.  DON'T go to other Salsita's expecting what you get here at the 16th St location.  This is the best one!!!  We eat here waaaay to much to be unbiased, just so you know.....\n\nBean burritos, cheese quesadillas, and occasional shrimp burritos are our staples.  Make sure to order guaca-pico on your burrito...that's what they call it.  And, we think the day cook is better than the night cook, but they are both very good.\n\nThe inside is a fun, divey, middle of the night and your kid still isn't asleep-friendly kind of place.  Salsa bar and homemade frescas round out the Filiberto's style menu."
1,"A special place for me...\n\nA few years back in Seattle my fiance (then boyfriend) and I had some vouchers to McCormick's and went for our first anniversary in January and still had some left over so we went for Valentine's Day that February.  We like it so much we go there for our anniversary every year and since the first year we have always sat in a \""snug\"" which is a private booth with a curtain so you can have a nice quiet meal with your dining guest.\n\nThe food is always fantastic and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I always order seafood (usually fish) and my seafood-averted sig other usually gets steak.  I think it can be romantic if you're dining in the snugs, but if you're out with the rest of the diners it's just another nice dining room and can be a little on the loud side.  We have no complaints and will continue the anniversary dinners and more.\n\nTheir happy hour is fantastic.  The drink specials aren't anything to write home about, but the food is worth the trip.  The burger seems to always be around and I recommend the fish tacos if they show up as well.  I've never had any bad meals and the ever-changing menu keeps us coming back for more.  I've had many, many desserts and they are all fantastic.  The creme brulee is a solid choice and the flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is as sinful and decadent as it sounds.  The wine list is somewhat short when it comes to \""by the glass\"" offerings, but I never have a problem finding one I like.\n\nAnother little-known perk is their Preferred Guest Membership.  You are awarded points for every dollar you spend.  If you are a frequent visitor like myself, then it's worth it.  Otherwise, it could take far too many happy hours to rack up enough points for anything substantial.  The best part - it's free.  Details are on their website.\n\nI've also been to two other locations in Seattle and Bellevue and have had great experiences there as well.  Eat, drink, repeat!"
0,This place was disgusting even my 12 year old did not like it. Everything came out of a box. We were very disappointed and will not return to this buffet.
1,"It's a tough job, pairing a big life accomplishment with a meal. But Honey knocked it out of the park with Cafe Bink last night to celebrate his sweet new gig. I should preface this by saying my favorite meal of all time was at Binkley's two years ago. The meal was something I still find myself daydreaming about. It set the bar. \nSo when he told me we were venturing back over to the land of Chef Binkley I was giddy like a school girl with a new lip gloss. \nWe arrive and the place is packed. It was pretty small but they worked the space well and offered great outdoor seating.\nThe menu was well done with cafe-inspired food with a twist. Honey was excited about the pulled-to-order mozzarella so we ordered that to start the night. A nice French bottle of vino was opened for our celebratory toast. \nOkay, the mozzarella immediately brought me back to the food we weeped over at Binkleys. It was OFF THE HOOK. Served with thin crostinis and three amazing sauces- I could have eaten dish after dish after dish of it for appetizer, entree and dessert.  \nEntrees were the steak frites, and bacon-wrapped meatloaf along with a side of brussels sprouts with more bacon. Toe-curling deeeelish. The steak frites were perfectly med-rare and the sauce was light and flavorful. The accompanying fries were exactly as you would expect. Piping hot, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and deliciously seasoned. And what's not to love about truffle ketchup? \nThe meatloaf was everything I wanted it to be. Complex yet comforting with buttermilk mashers and charred onions. YUMMMMMM. We also loved the brussels sprouts - we make a similar dish at home and think they would have been even better with a little Sriracha, but what do we know? \nWe were full but in the company of such good food and amazing service, we opted for dessert for the first time in a long, long time. Donuts with three sauces? Um, no-brainer. Enter various sized fresh donuts with salted caramel, dark chocolate and yummy creme fraiche with vanilla bean. The night ended as perfect as it began. \nCafe Bink is absolutely at the top of the more casual upscale restaurants in the area for me and there is no doubt I'll soon return and try their lunch menu as well. It's 10:35am...I have less than an hour to wait. :)"
1,"Dr Woodbury and his staff are 100% professional.   Everyone in the office from the receptionist to the hygienists to Dr Woodbury are super friendly and super competent.   This is not a big operation with a bunch of anonymous actors...it's just Dr Woodbury, a couple of hygienists and the receptionist.   Dr Woodbury gives you an honest evaluation of your dental health...ie: work that needs to be done vs work that should be done to work that will need to be done in the future.  There's no pushing to get work done.   I went without dental care for many years because I couldn't find a dentist that I felt was honest,  competent, and friendly.   I read reviews of Dr Woodbury on several sites and decided to give him a try...and I'm 100% happy with my choice.  You will be too."
0,I ordered the spicy shrimp whichis noted as very spicy.  It was so NOT spicy and NOT flavorful.  However I had a nice time inspite of the food.....
0,"It's okay, but there certainly is better Thai available in the area.  Had the drunken noodles and masaman curry. Noodles where bland and gummy and needed a healthy dose of Sirracha. Curry was just okay but they screwed up the order (ordered only veg, came with chicken and tofu). To top it off the service was super slow and spotty. The place was busy though so maybe I didn't order the right stuff."
1,"My boyfriend and I had just awoken from a long nap that lasted from 6pm-midnight and we were starving! We went downstairs (@ the Encore) to find some midnight snacks expecting nothing but snackage to be available at such a late hour. How wrong we were! To our pleasant surprise, one of the security guards in the Casino suggested Stratta.\n\nRestaurant decor: classy, clean, good for couples, small groups, even large tables available for big groups\n\nService: Excellent, attentive, prompt\n\nFood: Very Good. We ordered Spaghetti and a Rib Eye steak, made exactly the way we ordered it. The only thing that wasn't good was the garlic bread...a little too much oil that made it soggy. But it was still decent.\n\nPrice: High, but to be expected from vegas so no points docked from this category.\n\nI would definitely come back here again. I usually don't like spaghetti dishes because of the sauce. For some odd reason I just don't like tomato sauce with tomatoes in it...but the sauce in this particular spaghetti dish was delicious! It was was an odd color orange...but good. \n\nIf you're staying at the Encore or a nearby hotel and just want real food for a late light snack and not a bag of nuts and berries from the 24 hr cafe, come here!"
0,"CAUTION! Do not go to this club. The \""managers\"" lie and try to over charge both guys and girls. Avoid at all costs."
1,"I loved this place! \n\nWe came here on one of our last days on Vegas and found it while walking around the Golden Nugget. When we sat down to take a look at the Menu's, I decided to look on yelp and see what the reviews were. Once I saw the 4 star rating, I know I was going to be impressed.\n\nWhen I said take a look at the Menu, it took awhile due to there being lots to choose from! \n\nWe had a table of 6 and we ordered pretty much everything from breakfast to lunch. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and all I have to say is WOW! These were probably the best Eggs Benedict I have tasted in a long long time. I also ordered a short stack of pancakes which were also pretty tasty.\n\nThe customer service was awesome as well!\n\nYou definitely need to stop on by if you're in the Golden Nugget!"
0,"Ended up at Litchfield Park after a business meeting.  Hungry so I pulled into the Basha's parking lot because I saw Tasty Asian Kitchen.  Chinese food?  Yeah I can do that-- I love good chinese food.\nThe operative word is good.  Ordered lunch special of Egg Foo Young that came with egg fried rice, egg roll and soup.  The soup came out in a small bowl that could have accompanied a toddler's tea set.  There were 5 tablespoons of soup in the bowl--literally.  I said to myself:  What do you want, it's a lunch special?  Be nice.  \nThe egg foo young was interesting.  I looked at it a few times until I could see where the egg foo young was.  The egg foo young consisted of two hockey pucks made with egg obviously. T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.  Pork slices were on top of it with a brown sauce.  Ugh! \nThen the egg fried rice.  Did someone say egg?  No egg--just a mound of sticky brown rice clearly created by adding soy sauce to overcooked clumped white rice.  Wow, what culinary prowess.  I can't tell you how bad the rice was.  None of it was eaten. The egg roll was fine.  Probably purchased frozen so all they had to do was fry it.  No wonder it was good.  \nHubby had chicken with broccoli and it was mediocre at best.  The same egg fried rice in one, brown mound of clump.  None of it was eaten.\nI felt it was my duty to tell them that the rice was terrible.  They have to try to fix it right??  Silence would have made me an accomplice to the worst egg fried rice I have ever, ever, ever had.  \nIf there were a minus star system, I would have rating them a minus one.  As it is, they get a one star for keeping their doors open and trying to contribute to our failing economy."
0,"The service was wonderful.  We came into this place because of a GROUPON.  The men's bathroom was disgusting.  I stuck to the floor walking around this restaurant, and it just seemed like a really good cleaning crew should come in and help this restaurant out.  The food was OK.  My BBQ was not really warm/hot and I was still hungry after sharing a large sampler plate with Paul.  I don't think I will be coming back to this place.  But I did try!"
1,"Outstanding Value:\n   I applaud Station Casinos for charging reasonable prices for delicious food. Palace Station is the exception.\n  On a Saturday night, I waited on line for a couple of minutes, paid a little over $10 for the dinner buffet, and was eating delicious food.\n  In my opinion the high points were the Asian foods station, shrimp scampi with pasta, and soup. The one disappointment is that there was not won ton soup.\n  The music, the whole era of rock and roll was enjoyable listening to. The buffet was not packed, so I did not feel rushed.\n  I have dined here numerous times on a Saturday night, and have left satisfied and full."
1,"I ate at Roaring Fork during a recent business trip to the Scottsdale area.  We were quite a large party - 10 people, but the service was very good.  We were all served promptly and the waiters were friendly and helpful.\n\nI had the roasted chicken with cornbread stuffing which was very good - the flavor and crispy skin on the chicken was really nice and the stuffing was delicious.  Many of our group had the Big Ass Burger which looked really good, and everyone seemed to enjoy it as well.\n\nIf I was looking for a casual dinner in the Scottsdale area in the future, Roaring Fork would definitely be on my list."
0,"Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.\nNot bad, but for their high prices and the quality, there are better choices in LV.\n\nNoise level is high."
1,"I love the pharmacy staff at this Fry's! Mr. Patel is a great Pharmacist as is the other lady and are very helpful and knowledgeable. They have a great staff behind them who take care of bidniz too! There's one I think is really cute but I don't see her there that often anymore :( \n\n***The Bafroom: I also had an interesting bathroom experience here one early morning. After a long night of drinking and avoiding an old friend all night that was trying hard to hook up with me, I finally made my way out off that house party all 007/Mission Impossible style! My ride left early like around 3:00am and at about 5:00am I finally made my escape. It was a quarter to 6 when I finally made my way to this same Fry's with the most unbearable urge to go #2! I found out the hard way that they don't open their doors until 6:00am and I had 15 minute left and was already doing the #2 shuffle dance outside the store. I banged on the glass door flashing my I.D. to show them I come in peace and mean no harm and finally someone had let me in early. Phewwww, was it a close call! Needless to say, I must have passed out on the crapper for at least 20 before I caught consciousness and realized where I was and what I needed to do to complete this mission. I finished up my business and I was on my way. The bathrooms were clean and I was never bothered during my nap. Great bathroom experience. I give their bathrooms 5 stars too! Thanks Fry's/Krogers!"
1,"I was really nervous about staying at the Plaza after reading all of the reviews but I took a chance.  I was on the 11th  floor room 1102 loved it instantly, I came prepared with an air freshener because of the reviews that said there was a bad odor , I never used it all four days I was there.  The room is really big with a perfect view of Fremont street.  The coffee pot was really cool it was a kuerig single cup serve. The bed was really comfortable also . The girls at the front desk are extremely nice . The restaurants we ate at hash house a go go and Oscars steakhouse were so good but I was really impressed by the bartenders at Oscars there were two of them Steve and Kevin , we ate at the bar so we didn't have to wait for a table , these two gentleman went out of there way explaining the different dishes . The food was phenomenal but the customer service was unforgettable . There's not one thing I didn't like about the plaza and I will be staying there again ."
1,Very good food! The service was great and the staff is very friendly. I highly recommend to anyone looking for great food and great service!
1,"This is one of my favorite spots to sneak out for lunch. The lunch specials are amazing. I'm a big fan of the 2 tacos, or the Taco and the cheese Enchilada.  In a small group setting, the service is amazing. \n\nHowever, once time I brought my Team from work (10 members) in for an off-site lunch meeting. I made reservations several days in advance. \n\nThey brought us to the back of the restaurant, and it took a solid 10 minutes for someone to come by with water. Then took several more long moments to bring our drink orders. Once we finally ordered our food, it took near 40 minutes for everyone to get served (this is including one member of my team who had to wait an additional 5 or so minutes from the rest of my group)  The food was still delicious, and very affordable. We were just disappointed in the service for a large group. \n\nAll in all, this is a great lunch spot, with consistent and delicious food. Just don't bring a big group."
1,It failed to disappoint me the second time! It's a small place so the wait time is not that long.. get their Ramen card so you get a free appetizer for every 4 ramen bought! Tryin the curry rice it's sooo good!
1,"I came across this accidentally and can not help myself but post!  It has been a minute since our wedding (2005) but I must say choosing One Fine Day was one of the best decisions I made!  I was not thin, young, or model pretty, and I wanted a photographer who could produce just one photo I could live with.  I have always hated photos of myself.  Anne was beyond phenomenal and I love my pictures.   She and her team went beyond all expectations and I would recommend (and have!) them to anyone.  Thank you One Fine Day for capturing our Sedona wedding on 3-4-5."
1,"Had another great meal here last night.  This place can't mess things up.   My wife loves the Colorado chicken salad....but the secret is to order it \""Stirling\"" style. Trust me on this.  It rocks and he is a great server as well.  Now if they just get Kiltlifter on tap......heaven."
0,"I took in 6 garments, two pair of slacks, a silk polo and three dress shirts for dry cleaning.\n\nFirstly, way overpriced; each article is $3.50, even dress shirts. Unfortunately, I was in a pinch for time and went with Concord anyway.\n\nSecondly, two of the dress shirts came back with large ink stains on them. The other dress shirt is covered with lint.\n\nThirdly, the silk polo came back with a large snag.\n\nFinally, the slacks are wrinkled.\n\nI am not sure how this company stays in business."
0,"My husband and I go here every now and then. The first time we were there we got the pork and loved it!! In fact, overall the food is good. I think they have some of the best chips around and they have good salsa. In fact, if it was just for the food I would give this four stars. \n\nSo why did I give them one?! Well, it has to do with the service and not necessarily the wait staff. I have loved the waitress and waiters we have had (except for one). Our second time there we sat in the dining room and the service was soooo slow. What made it worse was I could see my waiter doing nothing but talking (I haven't seen the waiter since). We have sat in the bar ever since so it hasn't been an issue. Our last visit we ordered the fried ice cream which was delicious until we found a hair!!! Ugh. The next time we ordered an entree to split and sure enough, another hair! Honestly this one was sitting right on top and we hadn't started eating yet so it wasn't a huge deal, the waitress immediately took it and got us a new one! However, when the owner brought us the new entree there was not so much as an apology!!! I wasn't looking for a discount or anything but to not even acknowledge the grossness of what happened made me so upset. Needless to say we won't be back, which is a bummer because there food is good. Hopefully they see this and start making the kitchen staff wear hair and beard nets (we saw the chef and there was no net)."
1,"A charming, quaint lunch establishment with a hometown feeling of having lunch in your grandmothers house. Aside from the rude and noisy table of ten next to us, the food was good, the waitress attentive. Then again, that made it even mire of a feeling of being with family. I guess we were at the \""kids table\""!"
0,"I wanted to like Round Corner Cantina. I really did. But I have to say, after my first visit here I'm not dying to come back.\n\nBefore you even enter this place you have to deal with something that isn't really their fault: parking. And navigating traffic. On Butler Street. Always a joy! Once I managed to deal with this step and actually entered Cantina I wasn't really encouraged; the music was playing too loudly for my taste in the front room and wasn't much better in their back room, which was so dark I had to wonder how people even read their menus if they sit there. \n\nLooking for somewhere a bit quieter and brighter, my dinner companion and I headed to their outdoor patio, where we found high tables and chairs that I honestly thought I'd fall off of at some point during the meal, they were so unsteady. Fortunately that never happened, because we were right next to a part of the fence where the beams were extremely splintered - just thinking about tipping into them was painful!\n\nUnfortunately, the service did absolutely nothing to improve my opinion of the place; I watched three tables that arrived after us get service. No one ever came to our table. After we finally flagged a waitress attending to a group a couple tables over, she said she'd grab our waitress. And we waited some more. While we waited the waitress that we flagged down went ahead and brought us some water...that came in plastic cups. I shudder to imagine just how much trash this place discards every day from these cups alone...\n\nAfter finally ordering and waiting for what at least wasn't an unreasonable amount of time, I was able to enjoy a pretty tasty drink that came in a jar (they have jars for alcohol but not for your water?) but was disappointed with my pork tacos. The shells were kind of mushy and the sauce and toppings minimal; mine just didn't taste all that special. My dinner companion's fish tacos were actually better; I kind of wish we'd swapped.\n\nI left just feeling let down. I honestly would've been happy to forgive this place's rustic look and loud music if the service and food were a bit better, but as it is I just don't see anything here that I'd want to brave the dreaded Butler street traffic again for."
1,"Dear Burrito Bandito, I miss you terribly! I know, I took you for granted during all of those quick dinners before class. I'm sorry! Had I only known that your food surpasses the best that San Francisco has to offer I would have visited a few more times before leaving. Your carne asada tacos were so good, and so affordable. And the El Patron burrito, which could feed a family of 4, was outstanding. I hope to see you again someday!"
0,"I don't have a lot to say about this place.\nSushi was okay. They put way too much sauce on the rolls and the rolls themselves are monotone in taste. Nothing spectacular, but nothing utterly disgusting at the same time. Would I recommend this place? Probably not. There are better sushi place around the area."
1,"Went here with a bunch of Japanese/Filopino friends who love the place.  I was weary being that the only Japanese restaurants I usually patronize have cook top going on or sushi bars...but it was really really good :-) Being \""safe\"" I only ordered the pork potstickers and the chicken on a stick (sorry forget the name!).  They were both great, especially the potstickers.  I also tried a few bites from my friends dishes (a fried rice I'd never seen before, some kind of pork dish, etc) which were also tasty.  For dessert, someone ordered the Banana Crepes which was delicious as well.  I need to go back and be more adventurous next time for sure!"
0,"The last few times we visited, we left really disappointed. The potatoes are super dry (and reheated), eggs overdone and overall taste is lackluster. Their sriracha is four shades darker than it was meant to be. Old sauce... or has a fake been refilling those roosters? Scramble, we're breaking up. It's not me, it's you."
1,"Snoh is my absolute favorite place to go for dessert. It's a little out of the way from where  I live, but I will always happily make the trip  for a Taiwanese ice fix. Now that I think about it, it's kind of an addiction. Snoh is a nice combination between shaved ice and ice cream. It's not too heavy on the stomach so it doesn't leave you feeling sick if you eat so much. \n\n I always get Taro snoh with almond pudding(lots of it) and maybe lychee jelly. No glaze for me! I personally think the glaze takes away from the lovely light flavor of the dessert. My second favorite snoh flavor is honey dew it has a lot of flavor. What is also nice about this place is even though it is a small establishment and it can get quite busy at times is the staff is always very friendly. \n\nAll in all, great service, great desserts with great flavor. I absolutely can't wait for Phoenix to warm up so I can have my snoh and not shiver while I savor every bite."
0,"Downgrading from three stars to one, due to a disastrous experience on Easter. We called a WEEK in advance to ask about vegetarian options, and were told that they could accommodate with no problem, even though it was a set menu. Turns out the \""accommadation\"" was nothing but an appetizer from the non vegetarian version of the menu with the meat taken out. Still charged the same price though!\n\nWhen we emailed to complain, they sent us back a truly patronizing email.  \""We had several vegetarians that dined with us on Easter and were very pleased with the options.\"" So you know, clearly its MY fault that I didn't enjoy whatever half assed entree they chose to throw down in front of me.  If it was my kitchen, I would have been ashamed to send that dish out to a paying customer.\n\nEvery restaurant has an off day... to me its how they deal with it that decides if they are a place worth returning to. For example, we visited Nittaya's Secret Kitchen last night and had some.. problems with the service. There was a mixup in the kitchen that resulted in our entrees being served roughly ten minutes apart. Not a great impression. What was great was that they apologized, took full responsibility, and asked what they could do to make it better. They did not say to us \""Well the other customers got their entrees ten minutes apart and they were fine with it.\"" We have every intention of going back to Nittaya's. Marche Bacchus? Well lets just say I wish this had happened last year so I could have had my rehearsal dinner elsewhere."
1,"I attend a yearly conference at the Mandalay Bay convention center and have stayed at the Mandalay Bay hotel as well. I used to stay at the Luxor and take the tram but I could not deal with the delays and BS. Once I even stayed at the Excalibur (Crap-calibur)......I said once, will never again. That was my fault for waiting too long to confirm my trip. I can no longer tolerate Vegas for more than my yearly visit of a week (5-6 days) and even that pushes my limits. But the Mandalay really helps me deal with the situation. It is a not a gaudy tourist trap like other places.\n \nMy trip this year started with a delay leaving LA so when I arrived in Vegas I was ready to hit the bar, one snag was my requested large King was not available. The young lady at check-in was adamant that I take a double bed room and maybe check later in the week for something else. Yeah right. I was booked all week starting the following day (Sunday 8 am) with conferences back to back. Meals are for networking and getting deals done, so no chance to break away. And I had my girl coming to stay with me during the week. I asked to speak with a supervisor, the young lady disappeared to the back office, reemerged a few minutes later to let me know they found a room with my requested specifications. Great! I thanked her completed check in and went to the room. \n\nHousekeeping was just finishing, room high up was spacious and well cooled since it was boiling the evening I checked in. The bed was very comfortable, high count linen and big fluffy pillows. There was a nice small desk in one corner and the other a small sofa and table. A touch lamp in the middle. The bathroom had his and hers sink and a great tub for two. The suite was larger than my first apartment. The TV had external inputs locked out; boooo. \n\nDuring the conference one night I had some reading to do from the next day's sessions so I had room service, the food was actually good. I had a Kobe beef burger, very juicy. Also hit the bar for drinks, not bad. \nWhat I really like is that Mandalay has an area between itself and Luxor that has shops and restaurants. We had a meal at Burger Bar, shopped at Fredrick's and The Art of Shaving. I went to the lounge upstairs which was decent, nothing special. All good stuff. \n\nI had dinner and lunch at a few of the restaurants in the Mandalay Bay, my girl did get a massage at the spa. She said it was relaxing. I also recommend Fleur de Lys for formal dining and red, White and Blue in addition to Burger Bar for casual. \n\nThe valet experience was positive, no wait each time I went to retrieve my car. They did change policy. I can no longer call from my room to have the car ready when I arrive downstairs. Luggage porters were all great. On check out we had a small Asian woman, I wanted to help her load the cart but she was like a demon, she got the job done in a blink of an eye. \nCheck out was easy, no problems. Next year I will budget for a suite at The Hotel. \n\nStay here if you are going to be at the Mandalay convention center. The walk is easy and there is a Starbucks on the way, just be warned everyone goes there in the morning, the lines are outrageous."
1,First this place is no longer Hair Masters its a Super Cuts. I found this place here on Yelp since my hubby works just up the street. I was in DESPERATE need of a color so I popped in ( they only take walk ins) Anyways the wait was long but they were super busy. I figured it was a good sign. I sit down tell the stylist what color I wanted and she went to work. The color came out like I wanted and much better than I thought it was going to since I bleached my hair last summer(I know what was I thinking??!) Anywho the ladies that work there are friendly and have open convos about everything...and I do mean everything so I wouldnt bring the kid like I did. Thankfully her Dad was there to take her out to lunch. The whole thing took about 2.5 hours and was only 49 bucks!! So all in all I liked it and am happy with my hair. The only negative thing I can say is the stylist put some kind of waxy based stuff in my hair and it took 3 washes to get
1,"Great gyro and fries! My buddy came along and got the hot dog and apparently it was amazing. Nice little atmosphere with TVs, Feel like it's a great place for a quick bite that's not too expensive."

0,"This review is about a year and a half late. Only until I saw her today on yelp is when I thought, \""I need to let these women know what MY experience was\"". My initial interaction with Sean wasn't the best. I called her expecting to set up an appointment  only to receive a less than \""warm\"" reception from her. Sean was rude, irritated and short. She basically told me (paraphrasing) that I needed to pay her up front by depositing the money in her account. Hmm! Ok! I immediately went to Wells Fargo, deposited the money so she would at LEAST take me seriously. After I made the deposit she explained to me that recently she had been setting appointments for people who didn't show. Odd, but ok! I need my hair done! She makes the appointment, assures me that she ll be ready 6am and it will take her 8-10 hours. I wake up at the crack of dawn to only knock on the door to NOTHING. Nobody comes to the door! I call her, NOTHING. I hated to bang on the door but, I drove 25minutes away from my house, at 5:30am! Finally, a smaller version of her came to the door. It was her gorgeous daughter! She was so sweet. She apologized and said her mom was still sleep. She tried to make me as comfortable as she could. Sean came down 20 minutes later explaining that she was up all night doing hair. Before she started, I told her that I wanted my micro braids to NOT be cut. I don't want them all being the same length (personal preference).She told me ok, and got started. After about every 2 hours, she would call her daughter to cut the \""fly away\"" hairs off the braids (to make them neater) and flat iron the hair (which was odd again. Who flat irons synthetic hair? )while she laid on the couch and tried to get 10 minutes of sleep. Fine by me until I felt my braids get a lot lighter. She CUT MY BRAIDS! The very THING that I didn't want. I couldn't even be mad at her daughter though. I immediately said \""Oh nooo!\"" Her mom woke up and said \""She didn't want her braids cut!!\"". I'm thinking, \""Why are you yelling at your daughter, when it's YOUR fault?\"" Her daughter wasn't around when I told her that I didn't want them cut!  So, now I'm just sitting there frustrated. Then as Sean is braiding, I'm noticing that she's braiding down only midway. Meaning, I still have my REAL hair sticking out of the synthetic hair? WTF? I asked her \""you're not going to braid it all the way down\"" She told me no. I paid her EXTRA $$$ because my hair is longer, and I have a big head. I'm used to paying a little bit more. Only to not get my hair ALL THE WAY BRAIDED! So now, I have cut braids with my hair sticking out the braid. No wonder she says you can't get the braids wet! I get braids SO that I'll be able to get my hair wet! The conclusion was, I had small braids with the bottom of them being BIG AND POOFY. She KNEW I wasn't happy as she asked to take a picture of it and saw my face. Her response? \""Smile, you'll get used to it\"". It took me a WEEK to braid those braids all the way down. Of course she posted my picture on her fb page. I like to actually get my hair braided for convenience. Not a week of inconvenience!"
1,"The whole family loves this place!  Owner Eddie adds a personal touch .  We always sit at the bar and have never had bad service...so I'm not sure what's up with the other reviews.  We've been going to Spicy Tuna for years and it is always the first choice.  The names of some of the rolls might be a little scary for some, but don't let that scare you away!  You can always order by number."
1,"Look out Firefly, there's a new tapas place in town. Luckily for me, it's in my hood! \nTo start, I've been reading the reviews on this place since day 1, yelp prompted me to my neighborhood goods. I figured the first 3-5 reviews were friends or family trying to hype this place up. Too good to be true type stuff. \nSo Of Course when I heard about Molly's UYE, and with me recently becoming Elite, I was TOTALLY IN! My boyfriend joined me, and we arrived just a few minutes early. Overall the event part was great, and I love all my new yelp friends. 5 stars for that part no doubt! My nerves were quickly settled with everyone being welcoming. \nThe food part was decent, and has potential to be really good. We ordered a monte cristo, good and filling but the ham inside was just eh. The chicken littles, very good. The sauce was unique and addicting. The tempura veggies. 2 outta 5. Not crunchy enough n a little mushy. The albondigas. GREAT, but more like over baked risotto balls to me. Either way, I'd order them again. I had the special, spicy noodle soup with tofu, a salty spicy ramen with a few veggies. The cookie-mon at the end was the best part, a gooey warm choc chop cookie with ice cream, YES PLEASE!  Also tasted the truffle tots and Thai jerkey of some other yelpers, enjoyed them both. I seen a few complain about the price but for all I mentioned as well as 2 of the watery strawberry lemonades, (yes the ones I should have listened and not ordred) but our tab was $45 and I thought it was priced great. One of the main reasons i will return actually. I hope this place works out it's few kinks and keeps up the good work. The employees were nice, the atmosphere was friendly. Excited to come again and see if I get the same attention as a stranger."
1,This place was amazing. I have never experienced anything like this in my life. This was well worth the $40 we paid to get in. The staff was so friendly and talked to you and knew the personalities of every one of these lions it was like you were getting to know them. A lot of the lions even respond when you call their names. You are able to get close enough and still be safe to feel a real interaction. The baby giraffe was awesome and so sweet. I love this place and will be going a lot more.
1,"Mesa Grill was my favorite meal eaten out of all the times that I've been to Vegas.  We started with the Yucatan Chicken Tacos.  The flavors and presentation was unexpected and delicious.  I had the Fire Roasted Vela Chop with Horseradish-Maple Glaze and my husband had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  I enjoyed both equally and couldn't say which was better.  Delicious, and expensive, meal, but I want to go back."
1,"Thoroughly impressed with Jason's deli! Actually ended up there because the place we were trying to go to across the way had closed down. So glad we got to eat here instead! \n\n Different feeling for a deli here. Family friendly environment without screaming children or the greasy stench of fast food! \n\n I ordered the half sandwich and soup. The club royale was huge and I could hardly finish it! Being from Louisiana, I was very critical of the spicy seafood gumbo going in but it really passed the test! There wasn't much \""seafood\"" in it, more like a few small shrimp but it had a great consistency and was spicy enough that it was burning this southern girls mouth! \n\n All the food tasted very fresh - I didn't feel like I was at subway or the like. The service was good - had a couple of people stop by the table and check on us. \n\n To top it all off - you apparently get a little cone of ice cream free with any meal purchase! Who can beat that? \n\n Over all terrific experience! Left very full and happy - will absolutely be back and will be recommending Jason's Deli!"
1,"I've been going here since I was 12. I practically grew up here. There was a patch of time where it lost a lot of popularity. But great skate is back now. Filled with people every Friday and Saturday. The best lighting system, the best employees, the funnest environment and DEFINITELY the best sound system in arizona. If you're looking an awesome place to go with the fam or for bday parties, or even with your friends, go to Great Skate. You won't be disappointed."
1,"This buffet has a large variety of food for individuals to choose from, and they have items for everybody. They even have an area that is mainly vegetarian. One of the things that I really liked about the buffet was the seafood and the meat selection. I had the brisket, which was delicious, and the king crab was also realllly tasty. When I first came I opted to skip out of a having some salad, but then as I made my way down the line I came across a variety of salads in little glass cups. There was probably about 6-7 different varieties. I tried the one with pears, which was absolutely delicious. The flavors came together really well, and it was overpowering in the sweetness of the pears. Another item that I really enjoyed was the pulled pork with coleslaw that was on top of something similar to cornbread. The pork was really tender and moist paired well for the coleslaw.\n\nSome of the items were not as tasty though. When I saw the pad thai it looked like it would be full of flavor, but when I tried it I found it to be bland. There was another item that I believe was called \""sicilian pizza\"" which I tried because I wanted to try something new. It consisted on a thick layer of hard bread, dried out tomato sauce, and cheese that had hardened over form being left over too long. Needless to say, it wasn't good and it just tasted like bread.\n\nThe dessert area was also filled with a variety of different items. There are about 8 different gelato flavors, but they taste more like ice cream rather than gelato. However, the gelato comes in these adorable pastel colored cups. There are also candied apples, but they are extremely hard to take a bite into, and wouldn't be something that I would try again. Another item that I wouldn't try again would be the dipped marshmallows. There are marshmallows that are dipped in chocolate or white chocolate, but the flavors are too phenomenal.\n\nThe overall service from workers was pretty good. The servers were attentive with filling up our drinks and asking if there was anything else that they would do. The ambiance was also nice, because right when you walk in you see all these bright flowery colors. However, this is only when you walk in, once you get past that the setting is relatively normal."
0,"I assumed that the BBQ chicken would be some sort of grilled chicken, not just chicken with BBQ sauce (at $1 extra!!!) that sadly just does not taste good in a burrito. \n\nI am disappoint."
1,"The food here is 5 star quality. I give it 4 only because I would like to see slightly more wine choices from Campania, where the owner is from. One thing everybody needs to realize is that this place specializes in seafood. I would challenge anybody to find a place in the city with fresher seafood but that would be impossible since they get it everyday the place is open. If you are interested in pasta, go with their specialty, seafood based pastas. There must be a variation in pasta choices of course. I know that even the most authentic Italian restaurants need to offer things like Penne alla Vodka, invented in America by the way and not seen in Italy, but these people excel at seafood so why not go with it as long as you are not allergic. More importantly, they know how to cook their pasta. The 'white circle' in the short cuts of pasta is what it is supposed to look like if you want your pasta al dente. American-Italian restaurants may not do that, but that is how it is supposed to be cooked in Italy. Not hard or crunchy, but just enough to feel the bite to the teeth. \n\nI have been here twice and both times the food was outstanding. Caprese is excellent, the calamari fritti is very nice. I had the grilled seafood entree (Misto Griglia) with shrimp, scallops and sepia with rapini. Tremendous. They give you the whole shrimp here so don't be surprised. My wife had the Gamberone alla Riviera, full, jumbo grilled shrimp which she loved. The service was great and the bartender is wonderful. You will like the guy, believe me. \n\nThe Pittsburgh food scene is really exciting right now and authentic places like this need our support. Give it a try."

0,"We drive 25 minutes every time we want Qdoba. The last couple times our food has been great, but the service sucks. Employees are rude. They don't great you with the typical banter. It feels a lot like we are inconveniencing them. Not sure it's worth the drive anymore..."
0,"Up side: I'm in love with their blueberry bagels! They are sooo delicious! My girlfriend has me hooked on them! Downside: apparently the blueberry bagels are very popular. Half the time I make the drive there, they are sold out. Why don't they make more of something they always sell out of? They've lost a number of sale opportunities just with my self alone. Service wise, half the staff seem like they don't enjoy their jobs thus giving dull service. They make no eye contact while they are speaking to you and when they do speak its so mono-toned. I feel like they're annoyed that i'm there. So I get my bagels (if they have them) and bolt out."
1,I love this place! The employees are always super nice and they have fantastic coffee drinks. The Mocha and Honey Vanilla Latte are my favs. Definitely a cool place to kick back and relax.
0,Unless you are going to save a lot of money don't come here. You have to wait in line for 30 mins. Then they gave poor service.
1,"I felt different emotions while I was watching this show - it was exciting, funny, beautiful, unusual, touching! All at the same time. That is why I highly recommend this show, especially for couples. I would love to see it one more time with pleasure! Wonderful!"
0,"This is honestly one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in -- worse than that ant-infested Holiday Inn in Wyoming. Worse, even, than the dirtiest youth hostel I visited in Mexico. Why? Because it's overpriced and disgustingly pretentious.\nThe worst part about this joint was the lobby, which reminds me of what might happen if  Salvador Dali met Christina Aguilera in 'Moulin Rouge.' And then they had a love child. \n\nI get the idea of a hip boutique hotel. But this is just some crappy 1960s motel that they painted black and white and furnished with shitty IKEA-esque furniture. Really.  It reminded me of  some \""design on a dime\"" example on HGTV. \""For just $40 and a bit of black paint, we transformed this aging motel into a hip destination!!!\"" Except that they didn't.\nThe rooms are tiny, the bed was horribly uncomfortable and even the bathroom was...well...odd. They didn't even have a coffee maker! And the huge flat screen TV was too big for the room, so we couldn't even watch it properly.\n\nI'm also convinced the front desk worker was faking some vague European accent, too, but I can't prove it."
1,"Spicy, fresh, and delicious pork sandwich. Le, the owner, is super friendly and knows how to treat customers well. Great value too."
0,"Let me start by saying, I work in television. Specifically, I work on television shows that rip managers like the one here new assholes in front of millions of people. Say what you want about Kitchen Nightmares, Bar Rescue and Kitchen Impossible, but we take people like the manager that works here and kick them to the curb where lowlifes like her belong. The only thing I can say is I WISH we were shooting this bar so I could give this bitch what she deserves. The following is a detailed encounter with the WORST MANAGER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY CAREER. Skip to the second to last paragraph if you just want the punchline. I'll understand. \n\nI'll set the scene for you: It's a Thursday night, my crew and I are on location working on said television show in Scottsdale. My boyfriend is from New York and we were looking to catch the Knicks game. Alas, we were pointed to \""the best Italian joint in Arizona\"" by a neighboring bar owner. We walk on over and set up shop in a lovely little bar, we chat it up with the Bartender, TR, he's great, welcoming, from jersey, he even shares tales of the owner's history in New York. Everything is going swimmingly, what a great night out with friends, right? We order a few appetizers  bucket of clams, bucket of mussels and 3 light beers. All delicious. Atmosphere is beautiful, great old school music, just a great New Yorker's bar. \n\nOne of our guys is an HUGE Ucla fan so of course, he brought his Ipad with him so he could stream the UCLA game. This is where shit begins to quickly go south. My friend asks the TR if he could use the wireless to stream a little better. TR kindly directs us to a heavy set, dark haired woman bundled up like she's never been in weather below 80 degrees before. My friend kindly approaches her and asks if she's the manager. Her reply: \""I don't work here\"".... hmmm My friend and I are perplexed... Well that strange because  TR just said you were the manager. My friend, confused, turned to TR assuming he must have asked the wrong woman. Nope, that was her and she just told us she didn't work here. Annoyed but polite, my friend leans over to her to get her attention and confront her about saying she didn't work here. He's joking with her at first, with a smile on his face. Her quip back to my friend, no lie this is what she said, \""WHAT DO YOU WANT?\"". My friend is taken back by her aggressive nature and explains all he was going to ask was if he could use the internet. She aggressively tells him she doesn't know the password and walks to the end of the bar, yells over customers to TR (the nicest bartender on the planet) not to direct customers to her and if they want internet \""THEY CAN PAY FOR 4G\""*\n*Personal Note: Bitch, we have 4G.\n\nWe kept our mouths shut until we finished our drinks and food. Contemplated staying because the locals at the bar acknowledged the manager is known for being a bitch. TR was so great and welcoming and apologized for her behavior. Sadly, despite TR's attempt, we had to leave out of purpose alone. We close our tab, take care of TR because he's awesome and make our way to the door. \n\nBefore making our way completely out the door, my friend leans over to the manager and QUIETLY lets her know A) She's a terrible manager and B) we're leaving because of her. That's when she literally went Cat. 5-Batshit-Crazy on us. Screaming at my friend in front of the ENTIRE Restaurant, \""DON'T POINT YOUR FINGER AT ME!!!\"" \""IF YOU WEREN'T SO CHEAP TO PAY FOR 4G YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM\"" We let her know politely we're leaving and she's acting crazy to her reply, \""LEAVE MOTHER FUCKERS!\"" Yep. She called us mother fuckers for asking if we could use the internet. \""DON'T FUCKING COME BACK HERE YOU CHEAP ASSHOLES.\"" Yep. That was another one that really stood out. \n\nIt's a shame. We roll with a crew of 60 people and every city we're in, we take over a local bar and restaurant for the 3 weeks we're in town. We understand the hospitality industry and we applaud great work and most of the time overlook bad behavior. I can honestly say I've never experienced such shocking behavior from anyone in the industry ever. I'm still completely blown away by how incredibly aggressive this woman was and how such a great place can employ such toxic behavior. I can say, despite TR's attempt to get us to come back, myself, nor anyone from our crew will bring business here while we're in town. \n\nWith Love, \nK"

Hopdoddy, Zinburger and other places have much better burgers.\n\nThe chocolate lava cake was very good.\n\nAlso, I had a $50 gift card and they made me use the whole thing if I wanted to pay for my $35 bill with the card.

1,"A popular spot - we managed to squeeze in without a friday-night reso at 11pm (after waiting or 30 mins). \n\nVery friendly, helpful service, a good atmosphere and amazing food. \n\nI had the melting pot. It's incredibly rich and full of flavour - includes blood sausage, another sausage, pork belly and a puree of some sort (potato I think, but tastier). I actually froze my leftovers and baked them a week later for an indulgent night in with a nice bottle of wine... I highly recommend it ;)\n\nMy only grudge was the wait for our food. It's pretty slow.. But that may have been due to the duck in a can my partner ordered, which btw he LOVED too :)"
1,"It's a conglomerate HomeGoodsTJMaxx.\nAll rolled into one!\nSo much to see. I was searching for an area rug and had been to 2 other HomeGoods. This visit scored a winner! $99 for a 5x8 rug? Yes. Nice selection of area rugs and there were a few I would consider buying. Store is clean and checkout was smooth, which is important at any major discount retailer. I'd forgotten how close this location is to the 215, and will plan to stop by more often."
1,"We came to Flemings for our 30th wedding  anniversary after reading a lot of review's on yelp for steak houses in Vegas I kept coming back to this review ... Well let me tell you there was no disappointment in our choosing...  My husband is very hard to please when it comes to steaks as we raise our own grass fed beef he was amazed at how good the flavor,tenderness,of the Bone in Ribeye was I had the Petite Filet which was equally amazing... Both steaks were cooked to perfection sides were well proportioned...  The service (TJ) was great as well... I really liked that fact that even though this is a A+ restaurant in my opinion it has a very comfortable feel to it.... One short minus no Coors Light or Oyster's on the half shell... The Calamari was great as well.... We will defiantly be back......"
1,"TL;DR - clean, friendly, accommodating, professional, great customer service\n\nMy sister and I visited as walk ins on a girl's day out for pedicures. \n\nAtmosphere: The salon is very tasteful and relaxing with elements incorporated into the decor to promote relaxation. The lighting was well done so the technicians have light to see, but is not overly bright for customers. Relaxing music is piped through the salon at an appropriate level to be heard, but not infringe on conversation. The nail bar is separated from the pedicure stations by a partial wall that includes a water fixture (faux fish tank). We were greeted very warmly upon arrival and offered a choice of complimentary water or wine. Other customers in the area appeared very relaxed, and the general feel of the employees was warm and inviting. \nThe pedicure stations are simply amazing! The chairs feature massage seats and backs with various settings that the customer can choose from. The seats are comfortable even without using the massage options. The foot baths are lined with a new plastic bag for every customer and either new implements are used (such as pumice stones) or autoclaved between clients (such as clippers). The technicians make sure you are aware of their sanitary practices. \n\nThe service: Fabulous! My technician was gentle and asked before doing anything beyond a normal pedicure. For example, I had heavy callousing and she asked before doing a callous removal treatment. She did an excellent job on my nails and feet. The service included removing old polish, cuticle treatment and removal, clipping and filing toenails, pumice and callous remover for feet, parrafin treatment, foot, ankle, and lower leg massage with lotion, and paintedtoenails. All this cost $35 dollars, which is a great deal! \n\nMy only criticism is that my technician didn't appear to speak English and so her communication with me happened through another employee. However, the manager/owner made sure to pair her up with a technician who worked on my sister's pedicure that could translate translate for her. \n\nOverall, I would and definitely will visit again. $35 every few weeks for a pedicure is a wonderful treat and I feel I get more than enough value for the cost from the service and atmosphere."
0,The quality and cuts of their fish is declining since they open couple years ago. Do a taste test before buying.
0,"Probably the best looking Peruvian restaurant I've been anywhere outside Peru. This includes Canada, U.S, Mexico and Colombia. I mean, these guys did a great job with decorations. The exotic ceramic works (Huacos) are awesome! . Like I said...excelente!\n\nNow, regarding the food, boy, the place fell short. After leaving the place, I was like \""meh\"". Seasoning was needed everywhere. The ceviche was ok. No cancha (toasted corn) and the Lomo was also bland. The pisco drink was good however. My wife (american) who loves pervian food, got the corvina and was also disappointed.\n\nI've eaten much better Peruvian food in Miami and NY.\n\nLike I said, great place, but I do hope they get a better cook in there and get the sazon back in!!!"
0,"Skip it.  The sushi was average and was served too warm for my liking.  We tried the Vegas roll and the tempura was thick and greasy.  Another post said it best by calling it \""blah\"".  Nothing overly exciting about the rolls.  Atmosphere and service was great.  Happy Hour prices were fantastic, but I guess you get what you pay for.  There are several better options around."
0,Been here twice for a sandwich and piece of cake.  Both were OK. \n\nService was a bit odd both times.\n\nNice patio atmosphere.  If their hours didn't suck it  would be a sweet place for coffee and a piece of cake in the morning.  Missed opportunity.
0,"Came here after work for a quick bite to eat at the bar with a buddy.  3 things stood out - none of them good.\n\n1.  Don't be different in serving gin & tonic.  Served gin & tonic is a regular water glass, which was taller and narrower than what I'm used to drinking G&T out of--also regular straw dropped right in.  Looked like a sprite with a lime, if you ask me.\n\n2.  Time the food service appropriately.  Enjoying the blue wedge salad for appetizer and didn't really get a chance to finish it because the main course arrived 6 minutes later... they had no awareness or were trying to rush us out of there.  Really disappointing that they tried to actively usher people out of there--more so when we're sitting at the bar.  \n\n3.  TUNA AHI BURGER SHOULD NOT BE MADE TUNA SCRAPS.  What a terrible, terrible menu item.  It was not a clean steak of tuna meat, rather, it was a TUNA PATTY.  I can appreciate that it was seared and raw, ONLY IF IT WAS TUNA STEAK.  How are you gonna use the leftover tuna scraps, make it into a patty, and only sear it?  It's very awkward item to eat overall--I'm pretty sure anyone that's had the tuna ahi burger here will not be getting it again.  It's more of a trap, in my opinion, where guests that order it \""fell for the trick\"".  \n\nI will not be returning here.  If you are planning on going, then: (1) prepare to eat quickly; and (2) don't order the tuna ahi burger.  \n\ndmo out."
0,"So, I decided to get sum china food today!!! Umm i got spicy orange chicken n fried rice...... I'm not very happy with the chicken I thought it was going to be crunchy with sum spicy sauce but it's not.... In that case I should of went to Panda Express for realz!!!! Not as great as everyone in here says it is!!!! I don't like the taste,"
0,"Well,  the pizza was ok.\n\n The sauce is really missing that extra seasoning,  very bland taste. The dough was good ( get it well done ),  the cheese was cheap and straight out of the plastic bag already grated.The pepperoni was good,  they cut it length wise. To be honest,  its a step above the fast food pizza joints,  thats about it.\n\nThe guy on the phone seems to be in a terrible mood when you call all the time. reminds me of the guy from \""Do the right thing\"". \n\nOn the MoeFactor scale,  61/2 on 10"
1,Sehr gutes Bier und das beste Steak in Karlsruhe und Umgebung. Nur einen Tisch muss man fast immer reservieren.
0,"Twice now I have been overcharged for dry cleaning at Starcrest, once at the Round Barn location and once at the Windsor Road location.  The first time occurred a few months ago.  The second time occurred this week.  My husband brought in a suit and a $10 coupon.  The fee for the suit was $12.  His charge should be $2, right?  Well, they charged him once for $12 and again for $2!  To be fair, they refunded our over-charge last time and assure us they will again.  However, now that it has happened twice, I do not trust them.\nUpdate:  A day later, still no credit.  I drove down there with receipts.  Tony, the manager, said his records show I was refunded... twice.\nFinal Update:  A week later, a $12 credit showed up on my acct.  A few days after that, a second $12 credit showed up on my acct.  On this same day, I removed a silk shirt from my closet... a silk shirt that I was charged for full dry cleaning service.  On the hanger was a tag noting that it was to simply be pressed.  Sigh."
0,Who ever rated more than 1 start doesn't know real Chinese food! I regret spending a penny there. And also the staff and service are terrible how do these people even gave a job.
0,"Rather underwhelmed by the food here. The atmosphere is trendy and very hipster, somewhat loud. The food is just okay.  \n\nI ordered 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 soup. The minestrone tasted like the pan drippings from a pork roast with some tiny pasta thrown in. The pulled pork Cuban was more like just a plain Cuban, as the pulled pork had very little flavor. \n\nMy husband ordered the Pub burger with fries and a garlic aolie. The fries and sauce were good, but the burger was nothing special."
1,"Im from a small town just 20 minutes west of Green Bay WI and love that \""type\"" of small town corner bar and grill with a great support for The Green Bay Packers :-) \nGreat food and great staff! If you live in north phoenix and looking for a small Midwestern feel bar and grill this is your spot! \nI WILL go back again.\nAnd... Go Pack Go!"
0,"Dining at Lo Cascio was a horrid experience.\nTo the restaurant's credit, the staff was pleasant and friendly.  That's all I can say that was positive about my evening.  The food wasn't even mediocre in quality.  The salads were nothing more than a large plate of romaine lettuce leaves with one tomato wedge and two black olives.  The pasta had a disproportionately small amount of sauce to go with the huge plate of overcooked spaghetti noodles.  The marinara sauce itself was very generic, the only reason it had any flavor at all was due to the overabundance of garlic they packed into it.  The two meatballs in my spaghetti and meatballs came on a separate plate, covered in what seemed like canned tomato paste.  If you don't mind generic tasting Italian food this place would be fine, except they don't charge generic prices.  At around fifteen dollars a plate, I would hope for a little more quality in the food that is served.  Then there's the issue of the restaurant's ambiance.  My boyfriend and I dined in the bar so we could watch college football.  There was one patron at the bar who farted, gargled his alcohol like it was mouthwash, and made loud, repugnant, comments like \""this shot tastes like vomit.\""  I understand that's not necessarily the restaurant's fault and in a bar people tend to be a little more rowdy.  However, the bar was serving the full dinner menu and this repulsive behavior happened right in front of the bartender who said or did nothing as disgusted patrons tried to eat dinner.  I'm sure you can imagine how hard it would be to eat within the proximity of a man who was passing gas incessantly.  As a full time student who also works full time, I don't get a lot of evenings out.  I believe you dine out for a good meal as well as a fun experience.  Lo Cascio failed miserably at both of those things.  The check was around fifty dollars and for that I left feeling grossed-out, frustrated and ripped off.  I will never risk one of my evenings out at Lo Cascio again."

0,"Beware of \""late\"" rental charge when you return your car before the branch opens  Returned rental on a Sunday before the Hertz desk opened by dropping key off in designated box (no one was available before then). Boarded my plane at 8:40 am. Invoice indicated I returned the car after 10am. Hertz then charged me an additional day's rental. \n\nUPDATE: After corresponding with Hertz, they refunded the extra day charge."
0,"I do a bunch of shipping with my business.  We ship around 30 packages a day using FedEx and another 10-20 packages a day using various other carriers.  For about 2 years we used Ontrac but could no longer tolerate the lack of customer service, so we stopped using them.  I would email my representative and he would never get back to me.  We would track packages that say \""Delivered\"" only to be told by our customer that they never received the package.  Then we would go \""round and round\"" trying to get a claim filed.  I cannot say enough bad things about this company and it's lack of customer service and customer care."
1,"Great value!  I recommend getting a room on the 24th floor, which was recently renovated and still smells brand-new.  It was a very comfortable and nicely decorated room for a fraction of the price of other strip hotels.  What I loved the most was the 25th floor adult-only and European pool (i.e. top optional).  Despite the occasional \""creeper\"", the pool was refreshing and so very relaxing!  No screaming kids and strong drinks make for a great sunning experience!"
0,I was shocked at the mediocrity of the burGRs - its almost as if Gordon Ramsey needs to film an episode of Hell's Kitchen at his own restaurant. Particularly bad was the chantrelle burger.
1,"Do I really have to do a lengthy review of this Mayo Clinic???  This place is totally awesome, very well laid out, very organized, very clean, easy to find one's way around and they have the best doctors and practices in the country!  Their gift shop is most interesting!  You can find lots of gifts that are rare and the price is right!  This facility is in a beautiful area of Scottsdale, almost makes you feel like you're out in the beautiful oasis of Arizona!  I wish that more insurance would cover services at the Mayo Clinic..."
1,"The low rating for Kobe makes me sad  :(\n\nWe have stepped away from Kobe for awhile and been going elsewhere, but at no fault of Kobe...we do it with everything.\nBut the call of sushi came tonight and we decided to go back to our old favorite, Kobe!\n\nLately we have been 'failing' at AYCE and not really eating  enough to make the cost of AYCE - but we did work tonight at Kobe.\n\nThey don't have garlic edamame, which sucks, and I did ask if they could make it for me and the waitress looked like I asked her to make me a Gyro or something. I wasn't expecting it to happen, but I can wish.   \n\nTheir cucumber salad is always great (a simple thing, but something that I can never seem to get right - I must buy the wrong rice vinegar), the dumplings/potstickers were great!!! (bf thought they were too crispy, but you don't see him Yelping, now do you?) and all the sushi had the right amount of spice we were looking for, was fresh and didn't make me feel sick 20 minutes later."
1,Why oh why don't they have a Cracker Barrel in Califonia??!!  My friends and I were in the Phoenix area this weekend and this was first on our list to eat!  We were excited to eat our breakfast here!  We also love browsing through the country store and sitting outside in the rocking chairs.  I hope one day this chain will expand to the Pacific Coast.
1,"i really dig this place for its uniqueness and the sushi.  you'll find several one-of-a-kind sushi recipes here, and so far I've found them all to be delicious.\n\nwhen your sushi is served, you can tell right away that the people preparing it care.  it looks beautiful and the taste matches.\n\nno fishy smell at this place, either -- a big plus for a sushi bar, imo.  definitely worth a try."
1,"Hot Shot Vegas is brilliant. You can plan your entire Vegas trip through them - from hotels, day clubs, night clubs, table service, VIP lines, shows, limo rides, & more. Jason is THE BEST. He is the nicest, most amazing person and will take care of every client with the utmost care whether you use him once, or is a regular. (If you use him once, you WILL become his regular though :) ) \n\nI highly recommend Jason to anyone planning a trip to Vegas - you will not be disappointed!"
1,"My favorite LVAC in town! Perhaps I'm biased because I don't live too far from it. They keep the gym clean and have lots of equipment! It's hard to find an open machine during peak hours but if you go during late night, then it's all yours!\n\nI had left my work badge in the women's locker room. I thought I had lost it for good and was going to have them remade. I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask if anyone turned it in. Turns out, my badge was tucked neatly away in a drawer filled with keys. I was told that housekeeping does a good job regularly tidying up the place. I was so thankful that I didn't need to spend extra time from my busy schedule to make badges. \n\nJuice bar makes consistently good shakes. Going Ape is my favorite (substitute the vanilla protein powder for chocolate...trust me, this elevates the shake to another level!). \n\nParking sucks, just because everyone and their mothers are trying to fight for one up close to the entrance. There's plenty of parking in the back. Save some time from frantically searching. Get your work out started and your heart pumping and just walk.\n\nOh! 8 Strikes on Tuesdays at 1:45 PM! I can't go to these because I work but if you're free, I suggest you go to get the best workout of your life."
1,Only place in downtown Madison to get a Spanish latte that is in par with Think's latte in NYC.  \n\nWednesday is $2.25 latte day so keep that in mind for Concerts on the Square nights.
1,"I ate here for the first time last week with a gift certificate I won from the radio. I found out that it used to be Kavanaugh's, but it is now part of the same chain as PT's and Sierra Gold. The menu was pretty similar if not identical to that of PT's and Sierra Gold.\n\nI had the buffalo medium chicken wings, and I'd have to give it 2 thumbs up! The wings were super tasty and juicy! They were not dripping with sauce and instead were a little crispy which I absolutely LOVED. I was craving the wings days later and went to PT's and ordered it, thinking it was the same - and it was not! I will definitely go back to Sean Patrick's again just for the wings!"
0,"This place was highly recommended to me by a friend of mine that lives in our neighborhood, but I wasn't impressed. I ordered a beer, none of which they had on draft, and got a skunky relic that I could barely finish. After that, I was too skeptical to order anything to eat, and their food prices sealed the deal there. It is right up the street from me, but I have avoided it since."
1,"Just did a summer staycation there. Everything about this place is wonderful. Outstanding customer service 100% of the time -- wonderfully accommodating staff everywhere. The steady stream of free goodies poolside is delightful (Otter Pops! Vanilla Iced Coffee Shooters! Cucumbers to eat, or for your eyes! Evian Facial Mist! Fresh pineapple!). Just little touches everywhere that you don't find anywhere else. Great place for adults, as there aren't too many kids running around. Even the cheapest rooms are beautiful, with nice views. You'll pay for the privilege, but you'll struggle to find a better experience."
0,"Were  regular customers of Orient House under the previous owners. The real Chinese dishes are what attracted us after experiencing Chinese from Szchechuan to Beijing to Inner Mongolia and OH made some of my favorites.  Today was first time having their food since they reopened.  Ordered takeout (we almost always ate in before) and was extremely disappointed.  First, the traditional Chinese dishes were gone--was told they threw away too much food--???  Told the Americanized Chinese menu was the same, same cook.  Well, something went wrong.  Ordered the Chicken corn soup--smaller portion, don't strain your eyes looking for the chicken.  Moo shu chicken--everything was so shredded you could hardly tell what was hidden under the overall brown mass of sauce--no discernible pieces of chicken, mushrooms, carrots, etc. although seemed like lots of cabbage and it had a definite and uncharacteristic amount of heat to it.  Moo shu isn't supposed to have heat!!!.  And looked like flour tortillas instead of thin wrappers and only about a tablespoon of Hoisin sauce.  Spring rolls were mostly cabbage, with only flecks of carrot and green onion; could find no protein in them and I think they are smaller.  The shredded pork with garlic sauce was a favorite at the old OH but this dish was shredded pork with a pinkish sauce that was as thin as water and tasted only of sugar--no garlic taste at all--and something shredded so finely I couldn't tell if it was green onion or cabbage or what and very little of that.  If they have the same cook, they certainly have not kept the same ingredients and cooking style and this food doesn't resemble any of the great food served previously.  We will definitely NOT be going there again.  Bu hao!  (Not good in Mandarin)."
0,"I love this place. The decor is great, the baristas are knowledgeable, everything seems great. But the most important thing, the coffee, sucks. Its so bitter and nasty. I have been in here like five times because I think its going to be different, but its not and its so sad. They really need to shine with Lux being just down the street. They need better coffee. Plain and simple."
1,"This is simply a great bar.\n\nEach area (two downstairs and one upstairs) has its own vibe. The downstairs bar area gives off a typical bar-vibe. The back room is quiet and intimate, a nice break from the loud crowds at the bar or the house music and dancing upstairs. I'll be honest. I don't like house music (the oft-played tunes in the place). But great company, friendly DJs (Chad is rad!) and good service makes up for it.\n\nThere are daily deals (Mojito Mondays!) and DJs. They are open late every day.\n\nThere's a drink for everyone. Lots of imported and specialty beers in the case.  Even this beerlover takes a break when Ova is mixing the drinks."
0,I had a free dozen originals coupon my boss sent me there with. When i told the guy what I was getting he rolled his eyes at me! I get it you're not making a profit from me today but I won't be going back after that. How rude!
0,"Kitchen is great but watch out for the bar.  They only comp your drinks if you LOSE.  James Aguilar, (manager) NOT customer friendly, does NOT give a crap about locals.\nCame in here with my husband whom was gambling a little. Ate, played pool... ZERO beers comped.. We only hoped for one to be comped, but these guys were totally hard up.\nApparently PTs is hurtin for money if they won't comp ONE draft beer.\nNever going back.\nAlso put $5 in the juke box.\n\nWe are all around good patrons usually, but not used to the \""you don't lose enough here\"" motto.  Weird vibe. \nTake my advice... Go across the street to Eureka Casino.. Barry and Grace are so nice, and Fat Choy has a better menu."
1,"I bought so many frags from this place! Loved it got my water premade from them, so bumped out this placed closed"
1,"Come here for a quickly prepared, delicious meal. I've been here a few times, and I am a fan of their pad see ew, curries, and pho. However, I think that while the pho broth has good flavor, it is also heavily garlicky, so I would recommend adding more sriracha or lime juice to counterbalance the flavor if you're not a big fan of garlic. In general, it's not the best Southeast Asian food I've had (I grew up in New York City), but it holds its own. The cons are that the ambiance is lacking and the thai iced tea comes in a bottle instead of being made from scratch.\n\nDaily specials ($4.99 lunch and $5.99 dinner) as of today are:\nMonday - Pad Thai\nTuesday - Fried Rice\nWednesday - Basil Chicken\nThursday - Yellow Curry\nFriday - Pad Ke Mao"
1,"It really was as good as it gets for us. This delightful B&B is in the perfect part of town and Rob/Yoel are the quintessential charming, authentic, delightful hosts. You'll feel immediately welcomed into their home. The room we stayed in was perfectly appointed quiet, clean. sweet, delightful. Rob is a crack up! You feel you've known these two for years the moment you're greeted by a warm smile. \n\nLocation worked very well for us in that its immediately accessable to all of Montreal's \""typical\"" neighborhoods and sites but just enough off the beaten path that Rue Amherst is just quiet and relaxed. \n\nBreakfast was lovely. You're typical spread of fruits, breads, coffee, local cheeses, delish granolas. Seriously I haven't a single critique. For a next visit to Montreal we debate....try something new......or accept the fact that it just cant get any lovelier and experience than at La Loggia.\n\nAt each of our 3 breakfasts with them we engaged in enjoyable conversations with the other guests. That kind of environment only comes from special inn keepers. \n\nThanks Rob and Yoel you guys really made our visit unforgettable."
1,"Occasion: Drinks with Rich \n\nWhat I Had: Blue Moon ($8) \n\nDrink Review: Blue Moon's a Blue Moon's a Blue Moon! But this was definitely my first time having a Blue Moon in a tall glass with an orange slice. \n\nService Review: Good service. We were originally scanning for a table and couldn't find one, but one of the servers helped us find a seat with a gorgeous view. \n\nVenue Review: This is where the great majority of the 4 stars comes from. This was my first time hanging out at a venue in Vegas (that wasn't a hotel room) that was more than 10 floors from the ground. The Mandarin Oriental Bar is located on the 23rd floor of the hotel and has an absolutely stunning view of the strip. You can see Paris, the Eiffel Tower, Planet Hollywood, the MGM Grand, MGM Signature Suites, Bellagio, all of it all from this bar.  \n\nOverall Impression: I'm a sucker for good views. The view of Downtown LA is what sold me on our apartment, and it's no different with the bar at Mandarin Oriental."
1,"I've wanted to dine here for years and simply never got around to it.  When an opportunity opened up to dine with friends, as part of a table of 12, I jumped at the chance.  Despite dining as part of a larger group I still felt I got a really good taste of the Mon Ami Gabi experience. Our waiter was a pro and handled 12 like there was just 2.  \n\nUp until this meal, Bouchon has been goto joint in Vegas for French bistro dining for years - I can already tell I am going to have trouble deciding between the two in the future after this meal.  Prices were keener than Bouchon, the atmosphere was just as lively and celebratory.  Some of the highlights food wise from the meal:\n\nBread.  French baguette sticks served warm in paper.  Expected stuff but solid, and less messy than Bouchon's throw it down right onto your-lap-almost approach.\n\nMoules marniere were great, the only critique would be I would have liked to have seem more acid/wine in the broth.  Every mussel opened, not a single reticently clamped shut chap in sight.\n\nDuck confit. Rich, succulent and served with balsamic cherries, perfect to offset the fattiness of the duck.\n\nScallops.  Cooked spot on which really surprised me, given our group of 12.  \n\nFries.  Very unexpected.  Thought these would be standard frites, but were some kind of weird, flat pressed creation.  Ok, but I wasn't really a fan, I would have liked to have seen proper classical twice fried spuds.\n\nCelebrity note: A particular disheveled JWOWW wandered into the restaurant towards the end of our meal, entourage intact and making a mockery of the supposed dress code at the front door.  I'm half considering going back in similar attire myself to see what the response would be."
1,"My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.\n\nOur waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.\n\nFollowing the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food."
0,"My husband and I had New Year's Eve dinner there. For the prices we paid (about $150+tax & tip per person), we expected better and more food. The food was just not that great. One of our dishes was cold, but they quickly replaced it after we complained. And the dessert was just not up to par. I only had a few bites and didn't want to eat more. So we paid like $300+tax and tip all together for not so great food. \n\nPlus the crowd who ate there was stuffy. Most of the women who went there showed up either with a mink coat or a mink stole (and the restaurant told us the attire is resort casual). And don't bother trying to make casual conversation with the patrons there. Most likely they won't talk back. \n\nYes, like what the other Yelper said - it's a stuffy, pretentious, uncomfortable and mediocre place. If you want good food and good service - go next store to J & G Steakhouse at the Phoenician. We had some excellent food for very reasonable prices there!"
0,"Ka - BLAH!!!\n\n2 stars for the theater, sets, athletic effort of the performers.\n\nunderwhelming in every other way....I would skip this Cirque show and see any other one is the short review (I've seen O and Zumanity which were amazing)\n\nYou walk into a visually stunning theater with platforms all around, fire-balls coming up from beneath the stage and speakers in the seats....it looks very promising but completely falls flat.   They need to go back to the drawing board with the final battle scene (it!s a 10 minute blurry video...yes...a video of little avatars....at a Cirque show!!)\n\nIf you've never seen a Cirque show maybe you would enjoy it....didn't do it for myself and the orhers in the group.  Kind of a rip off."
1,"I just stayed at the Main Street Station for the first time this weekend. I come over this way to eat at the Triple 7 Brewery located inside the casino, and to gamble, but I had never stayed here. Im glad we did! The room was a cut above the normal Downtown room. Large, spacious and very well maintained! I dont think I've ever stayed at a hotel and been happy with the shower, but this time was the first! Hot water instantly, and the pressure was great! I'll be staying here again!"
0,"It is a grand tradition for Vegas for me to have a $20 cheeseburger.\n\nAfter doing old school hip-hop at Hakkasan and having enough kamikazes to rid that glorious wind, I was brought here. The friends wanted to do the Secret Pizza Spot, and we went on the search for a cheeseburger.\n\nThe Henry disappointed. For the price it commanded... we expected:\n\n1.) It to survive a cab ride home on the strip. We asked for it to be medium and not bipolar (cold on the outside, warm on the inside).\n\n2.) For it to not be dry\n\n3.) For it to have cheese\n\n4.) For it to be good\n\nIt did nothing.\n\nFAIL."
0,"I held off on reviewing until I had a chance to try Cento a third time.\n\nFirst, the good:\n\n- The setting is awesome. Might be the best designed restaurant setting in Madison.\n- The drinks are quite good. It's definitely worth checking out the cocktail menu\n- Staff is friendly but not exceptional yet\n\nThe not so good; I've tried a few things off the menu over 3 visits (Bacon dates, gnocchi, beef tartare, burrata, beets, porchetta pizza, bucatini carbonara, pork chop, cauliflower) so I think the following thoughts are pretty accurate. In general, the food doesn't measure up to the ambiance or price.\n\n- Gnocchi was overworked/gummy. They were described as \""pillows\"" and they definitely didn't come out that way. I mentioned this in passing to our waitress when she asked how everything was and I got the impression that she didn't really put much credence in my feedback.  \n- Food was underseasoned across the board. Pizza crust had very little flavor and the bucatini carbonara lacked salt - not sure how that's even possible given the fact that the ingredients include parmigiano and pork cheek (guanciale).\n- Pork chop was overcooked (we wanted to try the beef or lamb but both were sold out when we went )\n\nI really hope the food continues to improve and I'm not ready to give up on Cento yet. I still love the setting and will update this review if my next meal justifies it."
1,"Everything we've had here is great!  And when I say great, I don't just mean 24 hour deli in a casino great, I mean regular great!  During the last trip, we decided to go there because (we always stay at Sam's Town) and my husband was starving.  He got the steak and eggs special for $5.99.  It was an amazing piece of steak with nice potatoes and toast....I mean, good looking food, not just grill food.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich and the fruit plate and it was the most awesome and succulent fruit I've had in a long time!  This month we went back (three months later) to celebrate our anniversary, and once again got hungry late at night.  I ordered the turkey sandwich and it was a very generous portion of turkey and a great sandwich, with a pickle spear and chips.  Too much for me to eat!  My husband had the steak and eggs again.  The staff is very attentive, the cook came out at one point when he had no orders to make and checked to see if we were all okay.  The only downside is that they don't refill your beverage for free, but hey, I can live!  This is a great place to eat!"
0,"I've been to this Quaker a few times. Every time I've been disappointed with the food and service. I brought a girl with me who just happened to like avocado an unusual amount. She ordered a sandwich with avocado, turns out they were out of avocado and didn't tell anyone. I had to ask. \n\nTo be a little more on the shallow side, the beer specials weren't that great and the wait staff could have been more attractive. \n\nDefinitely never going back especially with the Carolina Ale house right down the road."
0,"Ghetto Ghetto Ghetto. What has happened to this Walmart? it used to be soo nice, and well kept, used to be soo clean. I used to just work in the area and would actually travel out of my way to go to this Walmart. Now I lived here and have to use this one more than I want to. It is soo dirty now, it is also never fully stocked, always out of products. Floors are filthy, merchandise everywhere, the farm stand dept smells like a dumpster of rotting fruit and veggies. I see opened food packages everywhere, and I see cold stuff that should be in the fridge in warm areas. I once went there for a can of paint around 7pm and had to wait an hour to get some help. We asked and asked for help and they kept saying it's coming, and never came. Finally I went to the service desk to alert the manager that no one is helping us. She sent someone 15 mins later. I understand that there are rude customers who destroy the store because they have no respect, however, the workers should be able to clean it up just as fast as it happened. I'm not sure if it's under new management, but when it first opened it was wonderful and I always recommended it to people. Now?? it's a damn ghetto joke."
0,"Burgers are lame and dry, which is kind of a problem considering this is a burgers and malts place.\n\nWe ordered a combo with ($12) fries and asked if we could substitute onion rings.  \""Sure\"" said our server, but when the bill came we were charged an extra $1.10...   and the onion rings were kinda soft, not crunchy on the outside.\n\nThe combo also came with a drink and we asked to substitute a malt.  Same response \""Sure\"", but again an additional charge of over $2.  \n\nI guess our server doesn't understand that it's common practice to let your customer know when there will be an additional charge for a substitution...\n\nMalts are pretty good and it's the only thing that gets this place two stars\n\nI feel like this location gets people by default being right next to jobing.com arena, but they don't really cater to repeat customers like a local restaurant, which means they don't go out of their way to satisfy you."
0,"Very pricey...at least compared to normal yogurt places such as Yogurtland. The yogurt itself is very creamy...together. It's actually a bit too creamy for me as I wanted a more yogurt-y feel rather than eating the many gelato places all over the strip. Anyway, this is what I tried:\n\nCheesecake: Definitely reminds me of a sour cream/cream cheese mix, but VERY, very creamy.\n\nTart: I honestly thought you couldn't go too wrong with plain tart, but it was creamy and way too sour. There was really no flavor to it; just creamy sourness...if that's even a flavor.\n\nChocolate: Again, a bit of a disappointment. It did taste better than most of the other yogurts, but it wasn't too satisfying. I guess it's one of those \""I'll eat it if I have to since I'm craving CHOCOLATE AND I NEED IT NOW!!!\"" last resorts.\n\nPistachio: Absolutely no flavor. Just a sweet icy thing. Hideous.\n\nStrawberry: This one was my favorite. It was pretty much the only edible thing there...actually tasted like strawberries and cream. Again, not the best by far, but certainly edible.\n\nOverall, I am definitely still on my search to find a decent yogurt place in Vegas..."
0,"First, I have not used their service, but I do thank those that have left reviews regarding that. Rather, today I had a gentleman knocking on doors and offering Armor service. I ignored the technician the first time around (albeit he knew I was home). After he left, I literally printed a \""NO SOLICITING\"" sign and stuck it outside on my door because there have been so many door-to-door salesmen in my neighborhood offering stuff. \n\nTo my surprise, a few hours later the technician stopped by again and knocked on my door, as well as rang the door bell. He totally ignored the sign, which is completely disrespectful in my opinion. However, I thought he may have something important to tell me so I opened the door. Ironically, the same \""trucks in the neighborhood\"" spiel was used with me (other reviews have mentioned this and it does actually happen). He told me, \""We've gotten a few calls about our trucks being in your neighborhood so we're going around to let people know that we will be in the area for the next couple days...\"" That's odd, I thought, I have yet to see such a truck. He then starts writing down all the \""info I need to know\"" in case I may consider getting serviced while they're in the neighborhood. Apparently, I am the only one looking at the sign I literally posted a few hours before. \n\nIn short, no, \""Scott,\"" I do not want your service. The whole experience was completely rude and disrespectful! And based on the reviews that have been posted, I think people have a clear picture of what kind of company Armor is."
1,"Best drunk food ever! \n\nWalk out of Marquee on the third floor of Cosmo and you will see a small door entry to drunk pizza heaven!\n\nIf you break it down, it is a simple pizza, similar to sbarro but the alcohol in your system make it taste so much better! \n\nThe prices are a bit high, but after spending all that money while in vegas, whats 12 bucks for 2 slices of pizza. or $39 for a whole pie. \n\nBe prepared for long lines, drunk people and a very small cramped inside."
0,"Went there on a Friday night for the first time with friends. The layout and design of the place is nice. They have a nice outdoor seating area.\n\nIt was more for the younger club goer. It got louder and more \""club like\"" as the night went on. If you like that sort of thing then you would like Mad Dogs. If you want to meet some friends and have a conversation over a couple of beers then I would recommend somewhere else.\n\nI didn't try the food so my rating is based solely from that one night."
0,Every time I ask a question they have no idea what I am talking about. Not very knowledgable. Last time I tried to enter the store the alarm went off (i must of had something still magnetically  tagged on me) and the shop keeper blocked me from entering. She would not let me in. I understand why she might of wanted to accompany me in the store to make sure I was not stealing since the alarm would go off again when I leave but that is not what she did. She was very rude and they lost my business.
0,"This review is solely for the event staff. \n\nWe saw pictures and reviews of weddings held at One Six and thought it looked pretty cool and we wanted to check out for our own wedding. Well, my first inquiry went completely unreplied to. I figured maybe it was an oversight, so I sent another email inquiring about the venue and received a short stock response that didn't address my questions at all. A few emails back and forth finally got me the answers I needed and when I asked to schedule a visit they were apparently unable to accommodate. \n\nCompared to the dozen or so venues I have been talking to, Eastside Cannery was the only one who couldn't meet with us and the only one who made it feel like pulling teeth to get information from. I'm making a safe assumption that they are definitely not the place where you're going to want to have your wedding reception."
1,"In need of a pedicure, I took Shirley B.'s advice and checked out Nail Envy.  Conveniently located right off the 95 at Sunset and Marks near my job in Hendertucky, I made a same-day appointment and showed up right after work at 6:00pm on a recent Monday.  Shirley told me after I had made the appointment to ask for Tina or Tara, so I didn't get to do that when I called, but, lo and behold, Tina was the one who showed me to the pedi station with the massage chair and she ended up doing my pedi, as well.  Thank goodness, too, because she did a fabulous job, friendly in demeanor and thorough at task.  I told her that Shirley B. referred me and she immediately knew her:  the \""Hello Kitty and hot hula lady, right?\""  Yup, that's the one!\n The $25 \""basic\"" pedicure includes a hot stone massage, which I've never had at any other nail salon.  Plus, the massage chair is always something I look forward to; I sat there for another ten minutes after Tina was done with my toes so I could let the polish dry and get more kneading done on my shoulders.  Because it was my first visit, I received 20% off the service, a special that may be limited-time only.  However, you do get 10% off with a regular Yelp check-in, so don't forget that if you go.  I can foresee this being my new salon after this visit with the convenience, price, and service.  Always listen to Shirley; she knows."
0,"The staff were all very polite. The place was clean. I bought the all you can drink wine and was please that the waitress did keep my glass full. The good stops there. The food was awful. There was a large variety of food, but the only thing that tasted good was the prime rib. Some of the food was cold, the rest just didn't taste good at all. We sampled a little from each station, and we didn't eat a full plate of food between the two of us. This is no place for a foodie. The dessert station greets you as you wait to be seated, and it looks delicious. I got two cupcakes and could not eat either of them. One bite and I was done. They were awful. If I didn't use a coupon, I would have been very, very, very upset. We had half off coupons from one of the street vendors. So I didn't fell too bad about paying for such a disappointing dinner."
0,"Went for dinner using a Groupon. I think I'd be a little more disappointed if I paid full price. There were only 2 waitresses for the entire restaurant and they were full. The servers were nice though and apologized for the long waits. Afghanistan is in between India and the Middle East and the food has influenced, and has been influenced, by both. \n\nWe started with the Ashak and Beef Mantu. In both dishes the mantus were just carriers for the sauces. The sauce for the Ashak was beef, lentil & tomato. The sauce for the Beef Mantu was carrots and peas. I liked the carrots & peas sauce better. I could see eating it over a bowl of rice.\n\nWe had the Lamb Naanwich and the Chicken Thigh Kabob Platter. The meats in both meals were perfectly cooked and seasoned. However, I found the brown rice very salty and the spinach rice only a little less so. The Afghan salsa was fresh and delicious. The salad bar was small but filled with fresh veggies. Unfortunately, the yogurt sauce that came with our meals was over seasoned and salty too. The naan is more puffy than Indian naan. \n\nThe gyro are not made in house. I've had those strips before and didn't want to chance having them again. \n\nThe waitress said that they would soon start serving breakfast. \n\nMy husband loved the food, as salty as it was. So I guess we'll go back at least once more. Otherwise, I'd prefer to keep my Middle Eastern and Indian flavors separate."
1,"Never had to wait that long to get my nails done! I've always thought they did pretty good job. I get acrylics and fills. Recently I got a fresh set of acrylics. They looked really good except when buffing, they would buff a lot off the top of your nail. So basically, by the second or third day, it really looked like I'd had had them for about a week. Different nail techs charge differently. One would charge me something, and the next time I came in another nail tech would charge me something else."
0,This place is closed.  Go to Jenny's instead.  Awesome!!
0,"After the symphony, we rolled in about quarter of twelve on a Saturday evening.  We were greeted by a shady group loitering in front with a \""Last call\"" warning.  The place was empty.  I know why.\nThat's not the way to run a business.\nSeedy section of downtown at night.\nWon't go there again."
0,"I do love the European Wax Company in general, but this visit was awful. The waxer herself was very very nice and could hold a nice conversation. But, my Brazilian wax did not turn out at all. I've had plenty in the past and this is just awful. To put it in a few words... Crooked, still hair everywhere, and raw. Im lost for words. Do yourself a favor and avoid a nice lady by the name that starts with a \""K\"". I don't want to put her on blast."
1,"When we order Indian, my boyfriend always, without fail, orders chicken tikka masala.  It looks so yummy, and I steal bites of his rice soaked in the sauce, and then I complain about how nobody offers vegetarian tikka masala.  Once I tried to make tofu tikka masala.  (It sucked.)  And then!  I heard about Tamarind.  And I looked at their menu online, like I always do.  And they had paneer tikka masala!  \""We're going here,\"" I decided.\n\nBut I didn't even tell you the best part yet.  I almost don't want to, for fear that the next time I go it will be overrun and crowded and I'll have to wait for a table or they'll sell out of something good.  But I'll tell you.\n\nOn Sundays, they have a 2 for $25 deal.  An appetizer, two entrees, an order of naan, and two soft drinks.  For $25.  And their portions are huge and come with a side of mixed veggies or dal soup.  You really can't go wrong.  Their menu has both north and south Indian dishes so everyone can find something that sounds delicious.\n\nI thought the atmosphere was really nice and the service was really attentive and fast, unlike previous reviews.  I will definitely be back and I look forward to trying more of the menu."

1,"Honestly, one of the best yoga studios in the country (I say this b/c I'm traveling the country on a regular basis). Certainly the very best in the Pittsburgh area.  The vibe at YH is warm, welcoming, unpretentious... I feel like I'm making new friends each and every time I go.  And each yoga session is a solid workout.  Kimberly and crew have fostered a community and lead excellent classes that will warm both your body and your soul."
1,"Outstanding food and wonderful ambience with a spectacular view of the Vegas Strip and planes arriving in Vegas. Particularly good for dinner,  but worth stopping in for a business lunch as well."
1,"I found my new home! After 9 months of searching for a decent pedicure in Las Vegas, I found Saffron (via Yelp). \n\nLiliana (ask for her by name) gave me the most amazing pedicure of my life. I traded up for a \""spa pedicure\"" and \""callus remover\"", and then my feet looked so pretty, I needed to go for French pedicure. In total that was $55. Although it may seem a little steep compared to nail salons, you must NOT compare it to nail salons. It was almost 90 minutes of pure bliss! Worth the trip and ask for Liliana. \n\nBe sure to get the SPA PEDICURE for $40, the woman beside me had the regular pedicure (I think $30) and that was quick and not nearly as relaxing.\n\nENJOY!!!!"
1,"I love to see places like this that still exist, old fashioned traders making everything by hand! I don't know the first thing about Pottery so all I'll say is that the stuff looks very impressive. Unusually colorful for pots with all different kinds of finishing on them. \n\nOne downside, custom pots can take up to 6 weeks to make so book ahead."
0,"I bought a water heater from this company.  It did not heat the water.  When I called they sent another technician who told me \""it wasn't installed correctly\""\nA month later without my approval they charged my credit card $173.00 for the second visit to install it correctly.\nNicky said she would have the boss call me.  He did not.\nShe just charged my credit card without resolution, and without my authorization."
0,"I experienced European Wax Center today in Chandler and unfortunately, have to say it was the WORSE experience of my  life.  I believe the girl's name was Sarah that did my Brazilian wax and I have to say, it was the most awkward & impersonal waxing service I have ever had.  I have been getting waxed for a long time and when I came across European Wax center, I thought it had a great location and great reviews which intrigued me on giving the place a try. Never again !!  As I sat in the waiting room and was called my name, the waxing specialist didn't smile, say hello, ask how my day was, nothing!  She acted as if she hated being at work.  Then it gets worse.  During the procedure I'm used to the specialist engaging in a conversation, not this woman.  She wanted nothing to do with having a conversation, a laugh, a smile, nothing.  She was far too involved in ripping my hair off and causing me the most extreme pain I have ever felt.  Again, I have had plenty of Brazilian waxes done before and never, have I  experienced the ripping of which this woman did.  Again, this is just my experience however, please be very careful as what I experienced is not normal and I will not be back."
0,"Place was very cute and everyone there was very sweet, but my nail polish was a mess.  I had a french mani/pedi. You can see that the polish was uneven and there were red thread like things in my polish.  They are way too pricey for this kind of job.  I was in a rush to get my wedding things done, so I didn't bother asking her to re-do it.  You don't always get what you pay for =("
1,"I get a lot of flack for being over-generous in my reviews. It is well deserved. I am an easy grader and I grade on a curve. But I never write flowery reviews to get free stuff. There's another reason for my madness and Nosh & Swig is a perfect example of a place needing some slack. A food snob could roll into here and completely trash the place. And I admit, the edges are rough, the execution is not perfect. But this place has potential and it has SOUL. What I mean by soul is, the owner was there on a slow Weds night (it was just me, this guy, and another couple) and he was chatting it up at the bar.  I just assumed he was the bartender but then he started recommending stuff on the menu and talking about the recipes. Wow. It was obvious this guy loves what he does and has a passion for his business. \n\nThe DRINK: They have a good drink menu, and it seems they have a full \""bar\"". I guess the better way to describe it is they served hard liquor. I got their non-alcoholic blueberry mint lemonade and it was delicious. It was huge (I couldn't finish the whole thing), served in a mason jar with a side of crack popcorn. Seriously, the stuff was so addictive, I believe he does sprinkle crack on it. \n\nThe FOOD: I was starving, so I didn't read up on Yelp reviews when I came here. I thought it was just another Nevada style pub. Noep. It definitely has a bar-feel, especially with the owner chatting it up with the locals, but I'd say it's more a casual restaurant that serves tapas. I got their elotes with garlic butter and cilantro. AMAZING! I eaten my share of elotes but these are different. The sauce they smother it in is pure tantric sex. Yeah.. that's right. \n\nNext I got a side of nachos o'brien (peppered pork.house potato chips, dublin cheddar. stewed tomatoes ) and a side of Korean BBQ wings (kimchi spiced chicken, Shoyu reduction). The nachos were ok, but the chicken wings were good, nice contrast of sweet and spicy. \n\nThings I didn't like were the chairs, they were too low for the \""bar\"". The prices are a tad high for what you get, but they do have happy hour Tues-Sat from 3-6. I have no idea what that entails, call to see what they offer. And the food got a little messy. It's beautifully presented but difficult to eat. \n\n+stars for the great, friendly service, the innovative menu and just an overall vibe of awesomeness. I want to come back and try their Dr. Pepper ribs. That sounds amazing."
1,"Great small venue. Cheap beer, live music, pretty girl's and a nice patio.  Get there early for big shows so you can be on the side of the bar where the stage is. The acoustics are much better. If you are there for the music..."
1,"This is a great new sport my husband and I went to randomly when everything else around had long waits.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice. Great design and theme but it was very cold and drafty every time the door opened. \n\nWe had the pig wings which were just okay. The sauce was good but overwhelming and it was really small considering they were two bucks a pop. Came with a homemade pickle salad that tasted like taking a shot of vinegar... I love anything picked and this was unbearable.\n\nThe Chiang mai curry was outstanding. Nice mix of coconut milk and spice. The noodles were crunchy on top and a nice way to soak up the coconut milk curry soup in the bowl. I got a spice level 2 and it was perfect, it was the right kick of heat without having me reach for a drink every bite. \n\nMy husband had the noodle #1 at a level 4 heat so I didn't even try... way too spicy for me. I did have the chicken on top which was not spiced and everyone's review is right-it's well with it for the amazing chicken. Chicken was nice and juicy and had a great crunchy coating.\n\nThis is a great spot to try something new. Not too expensive, byob with $5 fee per person. But it's cash only so be advised. They do have an ATM. I just think with all the apps out there they can get it together and accept cards... just a peeve of mine."
1,"Very nice atmosphere. Not too busy so it makes getting your morning coffee relaxing when you are not fighting a line. The toffee nut latte is amazing!! The breakfast burrito was questionable at first but overall good. The potatoes are a little heavy, would be nice with ground sausage. There is not really a good menu that is displayed so you have to hold your face up to glass to see what they have."
0,"Holy cow has this place gone down hill.  \n\nDingy cracked chipped plates, dirty cups dried with a dirty towel, food debris on the edges of the floor,  dirt caked on the edges of tables, tape holding the seat pads together,  ripped seat pads.  . . \n\nIt has been abandoned into disrepair I don't even want to know what the kitchen looks like .\n\nThe food was decent but I was eating with a little apprehension wondering if I was going to get sick.  \n( I did not)  \n\n$20 bucks plus tax all you can eat at lunch is not bad.\n\nService a little slow but polite.  \n\nManagement needs to clean this place up!  \n\nEat at your own risk, I do not recommend it until the place shows some respect for the culinary arts."
0,"What can I say, Trams has spoiled me. This place was average. I got the seafood pho...imitation crab meat, just 2 shrimp, rubber squid...Also got the quail and there is way more meat on my girlfriends ass. To say the least, dont waste your time, just go to trams"
0,"Also known as stab mart in the military circle this Walmart is not the best by any means. However, I must admit with the increase of security recently it has made me comfortable with once again shopping there. \nIt has been a welcome change to not have to travel all the way down Craig to the next Walmart to buy things. \n\nThis Walmart does offer some things that other Walmarts' do not normally offer. In example, around holiday times and season changes you can snag some great clearance items. They almost always have some kind of clearance specials going on in buggies along the backside of the cashier stations and have a clearance aisle behind the jewelry department. \n\nA couple of downsides to this Walmart is that the service is very limited. They have minimum cashiers and their deli department always takes forever to service you. However, the service you get is rarely bad once you get it. The people tend to be friendly.  \n\nI would also never recommend buying produce there. Their fruits and vegetables go bad super quick. During strawberry season I purchased two large flats of strawberries for a dessert I was making. The next day when I opened my 2 flats I found that 90% of my strawberries were ruined and molded toward the bottom. I had looked the day before and had not seen this. I have also had this issue with some of the bread products I have bought there so beware on fresh products. \n\nOverall, this Walmart could be better. There are some things such as cleanliness that could still be improved but in the 3 years I have lived in the area I have seen major improvements to what it was previously."
0,"I came here for lunch mid-week and just wasn't excited with any of it.  The place was busy, but even taking that into consideration service was not very good.  Since we had waited a while to be seated, we tried to give the server our appetizer order right away, but she didn't want that.  Then, only when she came back later to take our order did she tell me the item I had ordered was out.  That felt a little like a waste of time, because now I need to read the menu again.\nSince we were seated by the open kitchen, I saw our lunches come up, but our server was sitting down with the table next to us while our food waited under a heat lamp.  That probably didn't make much difference though as it was extremely unexceptional.  I tried half of the chicken club and half of the burger.  The bottom bun on the burger fell apart after a few bites - big burger sin!\nThe chicken club was dry and both sandwiches had components listed on the menu - balsamic onions and roasted tomato mayo, that sounded great, but were lost in the final result."
0,"I'm so done staying here.\nIt's not the rooms.. You get what you pay for with those. A comfortable (yet dated) place to sleep right on a great part of the strip.\nThe reason I am never coming back is because of constantly being bothered by the timeshare people (or whatever they are selling) who hit you up every single time you walk down the hall to Tower I or Tower II.\nI'm on vacation. I'm trying to relax. I don't need you to try and sell me stuff when I'm already staying here.\nSee ya, Excal!"
0,"I've been renting cars for about 20 years, and Sixt just provided me with the worst experience I've ever had. My wife and I flew into the Phoenix airport with our two kids. The line was only about nine people long, but it took absolutely forever because of the fact they said their computer systems were down. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. Then, when we got to the car itself, the car seats were atrocious. They were filthy and a couple of them were broken. They didn't have a single workable toddler car seat that was clean. We ended up just eating the cost of the rental in order to walk over to National and rent a decent car with a safe car seat. Start to finish, this was the worst car rental experience I've ever had, and I would not recommend Sixt to anyone."
0,"We visited for brunch today with friends. Our food was okay, the bloody's were meh and the waiter seemed completely annoyed throughout our meal. He never offered us any coffee or dessert and didn't seem to like when we asked for two checks (4 people). Since this is a fairly new place, I found it curiousl that nobody ever asked us how our meal was, there didn't seem to be any management present. The huevos rancheros and potato skillet tasted fine but the portions were small. The other couple had shrimp & grits and the pancake of the day, both were satisfied with theirs.\nWe will probably not return."
0,"Nitemare!  With the exception of telling us where to sit, photographer offered no direction.  Entire photo shoot lasted appx 10 to 15 minutes. While looking at the extremely disappointing images, the photographer left us no less than 3 times to take a personal call on his cell phone. Although a backdrop was used, in many of the photograph the studio itself was exposed. In other words the backdrop did not cover the entire backgrounds. Many of the photos had at least one member of our party cut off! Eventually we did settle on a package provided some editing and photoshopping be done. We were told it would take 15 minutes before our photos were ready. We came back an hour later and they still weren't ready. When we did finally receive our photos not one single edit or Photoshop process had been done! Clearly no quality control was done. 1 photo in particular that I ordered a 10 by 13, as well as several 8 by 10 of was clock so poorly bet the four year old in the picture had three quarters of her head removed and I had everything from my lower lip down cropped out . So you could only see the for your old one eyeball, and it looks like I was biting the bottom of the picture! When I returned I was disgusted. As I said none of this photo editing had been done at all. When the photographer attempted to fix his errors, he did it on photos that we did not order. There were so many issues it's impossible to relay them all on here. I spent over $200 on unusable photographs. I ended up returning everything. And now have to wait 5 to 6 weeks for a refund! Do yourself a favor... You go to Groupon and find a real photography studio. Because this place has proven the old adage you get what you pay for! And here, you get crappy customer service and very poor quality photos."
0,"Very low integrity bike shop. Which is now apparent from all of the other yelp reviews (unfortunately I realized this too late). If you don't feel like reading the whole story, the gist is this: Larry sold me a used Walmart bike for $30 more than Walmart sells it new and charged me an additional $38 (\""tune-up fee\"") when I returned it the next day. \n\nI spotted a used Schwinn road bike in front of the shop that looked in great shape and the price was awesome. Larry came out and allowed me to take it for a spin. Afterwards he proceeded to build up the bike as an awesome deal. He stated \""oh wow, we don't see deals like this come through our shop very often\"" and \""these types of bikes usually sell for $700-800.\"" Larry used the typical sales techniques, which is fine. What Larry neglected to mention in his extensive praise of this bike was that the bike is actually from Walmart and it retails brand new for about $30 less than he was selling it used. I will take the blame for not doing my homework on the bike before purchasing it. \n\nThe next day I went to return the bike. \""I need to return this bike it's not what I'm looking for.\"" Larry immediately flips his demeanor and basically begins pouting about the fact that he is now going to have to spend all of this time \""re-tuning\"" the bike. Larry not to worry, I bought it yesterday and the bike literally didn't touch the pavement. \""Ahh yeah but we can never know for sure, we still have to charge you $38 for a re-tuning/re-stocking fee.\"" I'll spare you every pathetic detail but when I called him out on the fact that it was a Walmart bike and it won't need re-tuning he said something VERY interesting. \""Well those Walmart bikes are poor quality. We don't buy bikes from Walmart or Amazon.\"" To which I replied, \""That's funny Larry, I don't either. That's why I'm returning the bike.\"" Still paid the $38. Hmmmm.\n\nAgain, I'm willing to admit a little naivety on my part but the way Larry handled everything was extremely shady and lacked a shred of integrity.  \n\nPlain and simple, there is too much competition in this area to do business like this. I (and apparently many other customers on yelp) recommend shopping somewhere else."
1,"Sambalatte is a hipster coffee oasis. \n\nThe place is filled with what looks like graphic designers, independent writers, and other 30-40-somethings that wouldn't be caught dead in a Starbucks or any sort of commercial chain. If you don't have a MacBook or iPad, don't bother to show up, these are Apple people.\n\nBesides the lack of cultural diversity found in most coffee shops, sambalatte offers a solid and quality coffee experience. It really is a tried and true coffee shop.\n\nI can't give it 5 stars because it is overly priced, it's in Boca Park, and it doesn't offer a variety of other collective-ness that coffee shops (being around the world and US as I have) offer. (The Beat, in downtown LV, is still the only legit coffee shop we have in Vegas.)\n\nSambalatte is a great spot, they have several great sandwiches, quiches, and an assortment of baked goods that will have you drooling at the counter."
1,"I was at first a little confused with the no waiter setup but honestly it works.  So you walk in, either grab a picnic table or sit at the bar.  When you get hungry you go order at a window and they will bring your food out to you.  Simple enough and reduces staffing thus reducing pricing for drinks and food in general.  I'm good with that.  They have $4, $3, $2, and $1 specials every day and specifically on Tuesday they have $2 pint beers.  You just can't beat that.  I'll be more excited to visit during the summer as the patio looks to be fantastic."
1,There are some mixed reviews on here so I was pleasantly surprised with this place because it was very good.  Started the night with a dirty martini which was made very well.  It was not too olive juicy...the house bread was an assortment and yummy!  next up the house salad with white balsamic vinigrette dressing which was excellent.  The dressing always makes the salad and this dressing was very good.  Next course was the lobster Mac and cheese which was so rich and really to die for...loved the lobster flavoring and how the macaroni were shells...oh so delicious.  For the main course I ordered the Bronzino...oh that white flakey fish was perfection....it came with cauliflower which I didn't even know I liked!  It goes to show veggies are delicious when properly prepared.  My hubs ordered the scallops and loved them.  We finished with the choc cake and it was average...that was the only part of the meal I wasn't that in to....and I'm I big dessert fan.\n\nVery good experience and good food!
0,"I ended up here on my birthday and the bartender made a stellar impression on the phone.\nWe called around 6-7 on a Saturday night and he said he would have a table waiting. \nI was thrilled to come in, and it was a nice atmosphere. They do well with the space they have. I was a little sad by the menu because they vegetarian options were limited. \nI ended up ordering the fettuccine alfredo with mushrooms. Typically I adore this dish, I can make it from scratch so I'm a bit picky about it. It came out with onions which was not on the menu. I despise onions with a passion. I had to wait for the waitress to come back so I could tell her, that was a good 5 minutes. When told she rushed off without a word, although I was still trying to ask her a question. It was really abrupt. She was generally nice most of the visit but I was still thrown off by the weird behavior. Apparently it was not supposed to come with onions anyway. The other gripe I have is that the sauce seemed watery and runny instead of the thick creamy sauce alfredo typically would be. The wine was very good, but again with the waitress I attempted to ask her about the wines and she did not seem at all knowledgeable while she dodged my questions. I'm not sure if we would make a return visit. Service and the confusing food issues just aren't up to par with surrounding places. My friends enjoyed their food though although were also baffled by our waitress."
0,"I have to admit that I had no idea who Holly Madison was before seeing this show, but I had some clients who were dying to see it, so I bought the best seats that were still available which weren't VIP, but the next section up.  The seats were good even though they were one of the front rows on the second level.  \n\nThe dancing and choreography was ok, the singing was good, but I agree with all the other reviews that Holly was pretty much useless.  I would have thought this show was pretty good if I had seen it in Atlanta, GA, but it definitely was not up to Vegas standards.  Holly showed her boobs a couple of times and strutted back and forth across the stage a few times, but other than that, the show could have gone on without her.  If seeing Holly is your only reason for wanting to see this show, then you are going to be disappointed.\n\nOh, and the whole nursery rhyme theme with the boobs just didn't go together.  It was actually kind of creepy.  \n\nThe \""audience\"" member, Timber, was very talented.  He was a great actor and was pretty convincing as an audience member.  Then he did some rope tricks in the bathtub scene...that was cool.\n\nThe girl in green who plays Ms. Pete pretty much made me turn gay for about 6 minutes.  She was awesome.  (Although the third little piggy who danced to Brickhouse might have made me turn a little gay too.)\n\n\nAnd lest I forget, the milk scene was cool.  I will give them that.\n\nIt wasn't horrible...I was just disappointed in it for $111/ticket.  For $50/ticket it might have gotten a higher rating because my expectations would have been lower.  I would recommend seeing another Vegas show."
1,I ordered an ice cream cake from Udder Delights and it was delicious. The lady who took my order over the phone was very patient and helpful. We had the vanilla cake with the superstition ice cream. I normally don't like ice cream cakes but this one I did. The decorating was a little questionable but the price seemed about average. I will definitely be back.
0,"What a rip-off!!!\nBought a bottle of Kraken Rum, paid $10 too much. $28.99 for 750ml whereas one can buy it for $18.99 at the Wal-Mart on Eastern Avenue next to the airport.\nLesson learned!"
1,"Are you a young, single, 20-something professional with some extra cash to burn and who wants to be seen?  Then the Cosmopolitan is for you.  Really cool hotel design.  Really beautiful crowd.  Great gaming floor.  Great bars within.  \n\nIf you're looking for a more relaxed vibe, stay away.  hehe."
1,"The Lee Lee Market shopping center in Chandler is really one stop shopping for great food.  We were already big fans of Phoenix Palace for dim sum and China Magic Noodle for noodles, so we thought we'd try Pho Van.\n\nWe both ordered the special Pho and it was quite good. Nice rich broth with all the requisite ingredients.  Lots of fresh herbs and vegies served alongside.  We got a pork spring roll and that was nice as well.\n\nBasically, exactly what it should be and about $25 for three dishes with tip.  Service was fine."
0,"This is a bit of a tongue in cheek tour for the tourists. Having seen the vaults on several programs on the TV we thought we would go see. The tour guide was good but kept going on about health and safety, people feeling odd etc.\n\n\n Our tour started at 3.30 from the royal mile gathering place and we then shot off at pace to the point of paymnt. We entered a building up a short but steep flight of stairs into a dark room of torture instruments, nothing was said about them in detail. On entering the vaults (tunnels) you got the impression that you where under ground but infact we where at least one story above ground level in the centre of an old building. We spent about 45 mins wondering up and down about 100m of tunnel in and out of 3 vault rooms all with spurious claims of paranormal activity with special referance to a stone circle.\n\n\n At the end of the tour you emerge into a pub (formally vault rooms) for a shot of whiskey and short bread. The tour guide had shot off for the next tour and we where left wondering.......\n\n\n On leaving the said pub, she passed us with another bunch of unsuspecting tourists heading to the payment point.\nThere was about 20 in our group which seemed about right for the space availible for everyone to fit in, any more then you would be left IN THE DARK!!!!!!!!\nAll in all a bit of fun & worth a look. BOO!!!"
1,"Good food, friendly service, but the speed of service could use some work."
0,"I was here on a random Friday afternoon.  It was okay, a different experience than I usually have, but I probably won't come back any time soon.  There were very few people here with us, so the waitress was around to check more frequently than I'm sure she would have if it was during a peak time.  The draft and bottle lists are unimpressive, but it'll get the job done.  They have a pretty decent liquor selection, but I can only image the price here.\n\nI had a few of their nachos off their nachos to share plate and they were a nice, thick chip with some non-descript lettuce, tomatoes, cheese sauce, and a few jalapenos.  There were small sides of salsa and sour cream.  I'm used to a big mess on the plate, but these were actually fairly neat to eat - I almost missed the soggy reject chips that are always left on nacho plates because that means the first ones were the perfect balance of crisp and gooey.  They also ran out of grilled chicken, so we had to substitute chicken tenders.  I'm wondering why, since it was SO packed (read: not at all), they ran out, but it happens.\n\nRedeeming points: Big Buck Hunter.  My boyfriend and his friend selected this place because they have an ongoing competition."
1,"So many Carnegie haters!  Really?\n\nI'm an East Coaster living in Northern California.  You want marginal deli food?  We've got it for you, in abundance!  But ah, when I get to Vegas, I know I'm going to have kosher dill pickles and  Carnegie Deli cheesecake.\n\nI could care less about the gargantuan sanwiches or the lobby coffee shop atmosphere.  It doesn't even bother me that the nearest restroom is 10 billion miles away.  What matters is the cheesecake.\n\nThe touch decision?  Strawberry or rugalech?  Through my amazing power of persuasion (bullying, perhaps) I manage to convince my travel companion to order the other.\n\nSO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD.  Cheesecake heaven.  Seriously.\n\nThis is the only time I *EVER* order milk, anywhere.\n\nIt's a simple equation, really.  Water and pickles, milk and cheesecake."
0,"If I could give a negative star I would but I figure 1 is more if an insult how, if the meat is warm? Can you serve a cold burrito I have given this place 2 chances and I advise everyone please please don't stop at the 16 at location keep going to 7 st or 7 ave locations so very disappointed ted I. This location give the name a bad reputation!"
1,"I went with a large group of people on a Friday night.  They don't take reservations, so it took us about an hour to be seated.  Service was prompt, but the waitress had so many tables it took about 45 minutes for the food to come after ordering.  Some of us wanted desert, so that took an extra 45 minutes.  The place is packed with lines coming out the door most of the time.  Personally, I think the food is good, but not good enough to wait for.  I also think prices are pretty high.  Two alcoholic beverages, a main course, and a desert is about 50 bucks a person."
1,"I LOVED this hotel. A was a bit darker than most of the hotels on the strip as far as decor but still eye candy and lots to do. I had no idea how much walking I would have to do just to get around. Bring walking shoes for Vegas, the hotels seem endless!! Our room was great and very roomy. The beds are ultra comfy and my hubby and I wanted to take the bed home with us. I slept the best I have in months due to the bed. The lions were a nice touch to go see on a daily basis too. I was there for a week but just started figuring out my way around. Next time I'll know. There is so much to do just in the hotel you wouldn't have to leave for a few days. We're not gamblers so we didn't spend time in the casino, it was smokey anyways. We were there for a work conference for my hubby. The staff was very accommodating and friendly as well as helpful. Treat yourself to Cirque du Soleil's KA that's right in the hotel, it was worth every penny!! We did get discount tickets through the hotel, they had a summer deal going on so we got them for $55/ea. I think we picked the best show. It was nice just getting back on the elevator and going back up to our room when it was done. We're not huge buffet fans so we didn't try that but we did go to Starbucks daily (there are 5 of them in there!) Studio Cafe has great food as well, had 2 meals there. I would stay here again but may try other hotels in the future. \n\nGet yourself a bus pass for only $7/24hrs right outside the hotel near the M & M store. The bus only takes exact bills and prints our your ticket. Ride up and down the strip as many times as you want. You will also find a discount ticket place right near the M & M store as well so don't pay full price for any Vegas shows.\n\nWe loved Las Vegas! Rent a car for the day and make the drive to the Hoover Dam (45 min) or Red Rocks about the same. It's so worth it. Don't pay for a bus tour, it's super easy to get around especially with a GPS. If we had more time we would have driven to the Grand Canyon. Bye for now Las Vegas and MGM, we hope to come back!!"
1,"This place is a home run every time!\n\nAlways a nice spot for a date or intimate dinner with close friends and family, Tutti Santi is our go-to for authentic Italian.  The service is top notch.   \n\nTheir gnocchi is, in my opinion, the best in the Valley.  Try it with their pink sauce (you need to request this as the menu lists a cream sauce with a splash of marinara).  \n\nMy husband loves the Ravioli alla Nina.  It's so good. Sometimes ravioli dishes are so darn heavy, but not here!  Nina's sauces \nachieve the fine balance of lightness and flavor and this dish is a prime example.\n\nFinally, try the tiramisu.  Light, fluffy and packed with flavor, this dessert is a great way to end a wonderful meal."
1,Super good! I haven't had anything bad yet. Both the red and green sauce are great. Good seafood options too.
1,"Great cafe to hang out in, work in and generally spend your day. Friendly staff and great coffee."
1,"I have been coming here my whole life and it is one of those places that you will always remember.  It has changed very little in the last 30 years except I think it has had a few different owners.  Nick's is a classic Greek diner with nicer dinner options (steak, fish fry, a few Greek dishes, etc).  The food is always solid and straight down the middle.  I always have the basics (burger or a turkey sandwich) and they are totally fine.  Nick's feels like you stepped back into the 50s and I appreciate that the owners decided to keep alive what is one of the coolest interiors in the US."
1,"As a first-time home buyer I was... well, anxious, clueless, and needy (to put it mildly!)  Danny was not only available at the drop of a text, but he also offered me honest counsel as to why I should NOT buy some of the houses that we viewed.  He was also very patient and communicative during a very challenging negotiation with a seller.\n\nUltimately, I ended up with a house I LOVE that has appreciated substantially in the 8 months I've owned it.  Can't recommend this guy enough to any other first-time buyers who need a lot of support in navigating the process."
0,"Ready for the creepiest customer service story ever?????\n\nThe other day I had a not so great gel polish job there; kind of sloppy around the edges, a few little bumps and bubbles, etc. My tech clearly could not understand much English. The rate had been agreed when I came in: $20. When I went to pay at the front,  I said to the owner, Wendy, that I was not thrilled with how it looked, but I had to leave for school pickup. She said,   \""OK, five dollar off.\"" So I handed over $15.  She said, rudely, \""No! You owe twenty! Extra for taking off your old polish!\"" I said that no, we had agreed on the price when I arrived and she saw that my nails needed polish removal.\n\nThat was when she GRABBED my cell phone from off the counter and said, \""You pay twenty or I keep your phone!\"" (!!!!!!!!) I calmly said to please give me my phone, I would pay her. After she handed it back, I said, \"" You cannot change the price after the service. I am not even happy with this, but I have still paid you. Goodbye.\""  No insults, no profanity, no yelling. I was holding her business card in my hand, and she grabbed roughly from my hand and crumbled it into a ball. (!!!!!) I had a few singles I had planned to walk back and give to the tech, but I was getting kind of nervous and upset.\n\n\nAs I turned to go, she ran out in front of me and STEPPED ON MY FOOT! This caused me to lose my balance and my flip flop went spinning across the floor, and she kicked it even further. (!!!!!) Plus,  there were a few other customers in pedicure chairs watching, and I said, \""Do you really want to do this? Assault a customer who has just paid you? Really?\"" Then another worker went up to her and spoke in Vietnamese, and she glared at me and said, \"" I call police on you! \"" I said to go ahead! She would be the one in trouble. But I was actually scared she was going to strike me!\n\nSo I fled, heart pounding, with nails that look sub par. I would never return, obviously. Wendy should be ashamed of herself. That's  a pitiful way to run a business."
1,"The most exotic experience I had in Las Vegas. There were moments when I felt I was in heaven. Great mix of circus de soleil and musical. If you are into broadway shows, you don't want to miss this one :)"

0,"I dont mind paying for good pizza and wings. I do mind paying for average pizza and average wings. There are so many good pizza spots in vegas I'm disappointed I payed 40 dollars for a pizza and dozen wings that was average at best. Im not from chicago so maybe  I get it but the crust on the pizza not very good. To be fair the rest of the pizza is good. The wings were clearly frozen and then tossed in sauce. Nothing great, and then to cap it off, my biggest pet peeve for a pizza spot is when they water down the ranch. I know we are in a recession but quality should not be the first thing to go. I do have to give credit to the delivery guy, i love when i dont have to ask for parmesan and crushed red peppers. With the variety of choices for pizza available in summerlin I probably wont order again."
1,"Fantastic cherry-peach turnover.  Freshly made and Oh. My. God. so good.  Great little place, some tables outside which was lovely in August, when I was last there.  Busy, so we got there early and were lucky enough to get a nice spot outside.  Fantastic breakfast and will definitely be back next time I'm in Madison."
1,"I LOVE CHURCH! I heard a lot of good things about this brewery. Granted that I am not a beer drinker, i decided to check it out since the food critics on here made it seem good. I'm happy that I listened. The decor is kind of shocking because it is a church indeed w/ beer everywhere BUT once you try the food, all of that goes out the window. One word: AMAZING! Church is a place that is cool to hang out on a Weekend night w/ friends to just kick back & relax. I will definitely be a returning customer."
1,"Our 2 boys are huge meat eaters and were very upset when we told them we were going to Luna's for Saturday night dinner, especially as our youngest hates hummus. We first let them choose a smoothie - that went down really, really well, they are both gym buffs, so \""The Gray Hulk\"" was their choice, they loved it. Then we ordered them the hummus appetizers - knowing too well what the reaction would be - but as soon as the youngest tried it - his face lit up, \""This is delicious - this hummus is fantastic!\"" \n\nWe all ordered different food, all of us saying we were glad we had made the choice because it was amazing. We couldn't resist but order desserts too - the chia pudding was to die for and the cheesecake - it was pure heaven!! \n\nThe food in this restaurant is first class, I know other vegetarian restaurants serve good food, but this is a cut above the rest and Luna's can boast organic food too, that's why the prices are what they are. \n\nAnyone out there who eats meat - this food can turn you around, absolutely everything on the menu tastes divine and everything they serve is top notch nutrition. \n\nAbsolutely recommend this place to everyone, even meat eaters and picky eaters, this food just bursts with flavor and goodness.\n\nNow our boys first choice to eat out is at Luna's."
1,What a little gem!  Felt adventurous for lunch and ended up at the Beaver!  Homemade Pierogi with muchroom gravy.  Swedish meatballs with lingonberry.  CUTEST family that runs this place.  Oh! and the sample plate was great and made me have the beet salad which was sooooo good!
1,"3.5 stars overall for this ?\ni doubt the reviewers here are 4seasons/ ritz carlton type of customers so gimme a break.\nthe pool area here exceeds other strip/off the strip joints.\n7 pools (2 are private/ club affiliated) but the main pool if you will is huge.\nthere are TONS of poolside lounge chaises & even the big kingsize beds are up for grabs if you work it ($200 something rental )\nthere are cocktail waitresses ($10 beer $15+ cocktails) .\nthe sun hides around 5 though which is the only sucky thing.\nour palace tower room (which ,by the way, is the tower closest to the pool. dont listen to anyone else.... palace tower closest to the pools. as soon as your elevator hits the ground casino floor, poof, your in front of the pool entrance.. )\n& speaking of, the palace tower is the 4th nicest tower .  ...\nso,we went on a tues-thurs in early july & each night (including taxes) was around $150\nour room was king size, 2 bathrobes, hot tub, his/her sink, walk in shower, & in a separate room was the toilet.\nthe parking lot,however,is super far from check in desk.\n& our text msg check in didnt work.\nno free wi-fi.\noh, & they charged me alot more than my guaranteed rate (the prob was fixed,but i was panicky while waiting on hold & that was not cute)\nthis is a super hotel if you insist on spending $7 for bottled dasani water  on a strip hotel... or if you feel like splashing/tanning in the best pool on the strip / las vegas.\n& might i conclude, i found a fu%&*# bargain !!\n----- OOOOPS i forgot to mention the best part ..!!\nin the hallway, in front of the (big ) closet, there is a vanity desk w/ a lamp & a light mirror that flips over to magnify like crazy... but the fact that theres a lamp & the vanity mirrror lights up gives you crazy makeup options!

1,"So far, so good  with this reincarnation of the student pit, I mean pub, The Crags.  As they're just getting up & running, I'll keep this brief and I'll post a further review after future visits.  \n\nThey offer a nicely varied menu, with options for a 2 or 3 course prix fixe meal. The service looks to be off too a smooth start, with a friendly, competent staff.\n\nThis is a convenient location for the many guesthouses in the Mayfield area, as well as convention/university visitors from the Salisbury Green Hotel & Pollock Halls.\n\nOur food was just fine, if not spectacular.  Husband enjoyed his fish & chips, but was jonesing for the roast platter another in our party was devouring.  I had the french onion soup, but did not enjoy the extra rosemary flavor.  For my main I ordered the vegetable tarte, which was unusual but tasty -- onions, olives, roasted vegetables with a basalmic reduction glaze.\n\nWe did not dine en famille, but  SA does offer a children's menu and children may eat in the dining area at any time of day. \n\nThe renovation is lovely, it's a beautiful space, but don't go expecting a pubby atmosphere.  The corporation (Mitchells & Butlers) that owns this owns 3000+ other properties and it shows in the manufactured charm.  But it's still a pleasant place to dine, drink & visit with friends. \n\nAs we can see the back of our house from their patio, we'll be there often!"
0,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!    My wife had a tire losing air so I decided to look on Yelp for some place with decent reviews and I picked Fletchers which is right around the corner of my house.  I asked them to patch the tire and then rotate the tires.  I took it in the morning and they called me finally late afternoon and I expected them to tell me that my car was done and I needed to pick it up.  Oh Noooooo.....  They told me that the puncture was on an edge and unfixable and that I needed a new tire....and the tread on the other three tires is also unsafe...and went into a sales pitch that I had to cut off. I told the sales guy that I would be there in 15 minutes to pick up my car and that I would take it someplace else for a second opinion.  My wife has a friend that told us to try Gene's Auto Works in Tempe....a little far but way worth the drive.  Sure enough....they took the tire off and found the hole smack in the middle of the tire.  They fixed the tire on the spot in 15 minutes....told me the tread on my tires is perfect and we were on our way......Fletchers has lost all of my future business and is very unethical.  I would be very careful before I let these guys do any work on my car and know they will try and scam you for sure!
0,"This happened on the morning of September 25th, 2011 around 2am. If you want to be handcuffed, thrown against the wall and the floor behind closed doors and then thrown on the street...then this is the place for you. The gangster Vegas is still alive my friends, it hasn't changed, well at least at the Wynn...maybe they were going for that throwback feel. Here's my story: I contact a promoter by the name of Luis Deleon, super nice guy by the way, he gets my friend and I a table right next to the DJ booth (table 708 or 780) in Tryst at the Wynn. Things are going great we got in right away. Before going in I stop for a second to say hi to the doorman, Ryan, I met him the other day when I went to the sane club 2 nights previous, he was also a nice guy but that's where the niceness stops. So I'm at my table now, I spend 600 dollars on a bottle of vodka and my friend I are having a good time..DJ spider is up on stage doing his thing, working the crowd and mixing an amazing run of tracks!! My friend and I invite this couple up ( Andrew and Jessica) to help us drink all this vodka, we start talking cars and nightlife in Vegas just normal stuff and then we realize...there's no more vodka!!! Let's buy a bottle of Rum, so I drop another 600 dollars on that. The bottle comes and we start drinking and dancing some more. I'm now successfully drunk and getting tired..but the nice thing is that I have a table..my own little area so I sit down and fall asleep, now usually sleeping in a club is a no no, but I have a table and my own area, I should be able to close my eyes for a second, I mean by this time it's only 1:30 in the morning and the club stays open till 5. I still have a good three hours to party. So, I'm awoken by 2 security guards that tell me I have to leave, I say, \""no, I paid a lot of money to sit here and plus I just but this basically full bottle of Rum\"". They picked me up forcefully and started pushing me out, I'm resisting a bit but what they did next was way out of line! They handcuffed me, took me to some long hallway where there was no one, pushed me on the ground and against the wall and basically manhandled me, I said, \""you guys want to beat me up while I'm handcuffed? Take them off and let's do this! Let's make this a fair fight, so first I'm gonna beat you up (I point at one of the 3 security guards there..the one that was the most forceful and aggressive with me) then you, and you over there..I guess you'll end up in the ICU!\"" now on retrospect I know I shouldn't of said that but I was drunk and just got beat up by three guys in an unfair fight. The first guy I pointed at said, \""how about I put you on the VIP list at Drais and I'll meet you there when I get off\""...\""Sounds good to me!!\"" he took out his phone and put me on there and said..\""see you there\"" they then took me to some door, to off the handcuffs and pushed me out on to the sidewalk. So to sum up things, they basically kicked me out of the club but decided to beat me up first. Thanks tryst! In the morning I woke up with bumps all over my head from where it hit the wall and ground, a black eye, a big bruise on my face, and handcuff bruises because they were on so tight. Basically I wouldn't recommend this place"
1,"I've never played laser tag before attending my triplet nephews' 9th birthday party this weekend. What a blast!!\n\nThis place was packed to the gills on Sunday afternoon. Not only did they have one party after another, but there were lots of families who were simply walking in. Now, maybe they have a procedure for entry that was blind from my eyes, but I did not see any ticket taking happening here. It appears that you can probably just walk in and join up with a group. Weird!\n\nThe cost of 7.50 per 15 minute game seemed a little steep to me, but I guess if you sneak into another game it might be worth it. (Although I would never recommend such a thing!) Buy games in bulk to receive a discount. They have other specials, so call them for details.\n\nGAME TIPS: Get up as high as you can. People that are down below are easy targets. Capture the other teams bases for loads of extra points! Keep your gun down when you are not shooting. You can get tagged easily there.\n\nLUKE, LUKE, LUKE.. you brave gentleman. Luke was the facilitator to our birthday party and games. This guy is the epitome of cool. He has just enough sass, sarcasm, and patience to be the perfect host to these wild, maniacal children. I found him to be quite funny too!\n\nI am taking one star away because the second game we played had 36 players in it. WAY TOO MANY! We were simply falling all over each other and it made the game way less fun. TIP: I asked and apparently Tuesday nights are the least crowded. \n\nGet in this place now!"
1,"After two visits, this is now our favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas.  \n\n04/07 Prior to our first visit I found a 2/1 coupon celebrating their first anniversary so we decided to give this restaurnt.  It is located in a small, nondescript strip mall.  The owners have obviously spent considerable dollars on the interior. Our waiter served us papadum accompanied by tamarind and cilantro sauces.  We decided to try the high end of the menu sharing orders of Jhinga Dum Sunerhri (queen prawns simmered in coconut milk, yogurt and a touch of cashew nut sauce) and Goshet Rajawri (boneless lamb cooked in spices, tomatoes, egg, yogurt and a cashew paste).  Entrees included basmati rice, a choice of naan or paratha (we tried both) and lentil side dishes.  This was probably the best Indian meal we have had in Las Vegas. \n\n09/07 We returned to find the menu has been largely revised with many new items appearning and prices increased.  Complimentary papadum was served with tamarind and cilantro dipping sauces shortly after we were presented with menus.  The waiter convinced us to try the evening's special appetizer, a crepe made with corn, homemade cheese and potato which proved to be an excellent choice.  Our first entre was Murg chili milli kebab - tandori chicken marinated in Indian spices and accompanied by an East Asian sauce. The chicken was amazingly moist, tender and very flavor-ific.  Our second entre was Baingan dahiwala - roasted eggplant cooked with yogurt and onions in a cashew sauce.  This dish was not as smooth textured as similar dishes served elsewhere, but was very tasty.   Menu prices may initially seem high, but most entrees include a side salad, choice of naan or paratha, basmati rice and a lentil dipping sauce - we chose black. Everything was fantastic while service was very attentive without be intrusive.\n\n12/07 update to include 3 additional visits\n\nWe were served housemade papadum with mint and tamarind sauces followed by a complimentary sweet potato salad that managed to be both spicy and cooling.  My wife ordered the lamb chop masala - small tender chops that had been cooked in masala sauce.  My entre was chicken makhani, aka butter chicken, - melt-in-your mouth pieces of chicken cooked in a creamy tomato sauce.  Both entrees included basmati rice, a black lentil dipping sauce, naan and an unadorned salad.  I signed up online for the restaurant's VIP club and used a 2/1 entre coupon that was emailed to me shortly before we departed for this trip.  \n\nWe were the only customers a Saturday afternoon so I suspect luncheon hours may be curtailed in the future.  We each ordered chicken kebab roll - grilled tandoor chicken wrapped in a Romali roll.  Lunches include a choice of ice tea or soda, we chose the ice tea.  The flavor was truly amazing, but the amount of food was more than we needed.  The cost of the meal is net of a $10 coupon received after I provided online feedback on our experience in September.  \n\nWe were served complimentary papadum with mint and tamarind sauces. Orders of chicken Chettinad - boneless thigh pieces cooked with pounded southern spices with a hint of coconut and lamb Rajwari - boneless lamb cooked with spices, tomatoes, yogurt and a touch of cashew.  Both dishes included a vegetable dish, naan, rice and salad.  We used a printable 2/1 coupon that had been emailed to members of the restaurant's VIP club)"
0,"Horrible, embarrassing, nearly criminal.  $14 a person to get in, very few food vendors, and the \""attraction\"" consists of a small crawfish pot, low-power burner, and one guy cooking.  As of 1300 hours, no crawfish ready, dozens of people waiting, and the cook did not even know what they were charging or how much one person could buy at a time.  Nonetheless, the pot could cook no more than approx 35 lbs every couple of hours.  Do the math...There is no way to serve the thousands of people arriving, and this was billed as a \""crawfish\"" festival.\n\nI WILL NOT be attending the 2nd Annual event, if they hold it again...."
0,"So, I must admit...I've never been to any other Mongolian grill. I know, shame on me. What kind of Yelper am I?! Even so, from what I've heard and read...this isn't the place to go for a Mongolian grill experience. I've been here a handful of times and it just seems to get worse every single time.\n\nFor the most part everyone who's been here or somewhere similar, you know how it works. But I was here this past weekend and watched 4 different tables get seated without anyone asking if they'd been there before or know what to do. Customers just stand there confused until someone comes back and for the restaurant, that's ridiculous. Sure, it's not hard to figure out but if you've never been anywhere like it, I imagine that's a frustrating experience. I hate their customer service for many other reasons so maybe my opinion is a little biased, but they definitely need to train the employees better. They don't explain anything to anyone, including the fact they you need to go get your own drink. \n\nWhen it comes to the food, it's fun being able to pick your own stuff and make your own creations but like others have mentioned, they are always out of stuff. Then when it's busy and only one line is open, the whole entire experience just goes out the window because it feels so rushed. Also, I'm not sure if it's a health reason or what...but why is all the stuff so far away from the counter? I have to bend down and reach under that tiny area to get to items in the back. It's all just very annoying to me. The food is okay but I think they overcook everything, again, maybe for health reasons? The meats themselves always seem to be dry and chewy. If you get egg, it's almost like a fried egg that someone forgot to pull off the stove. There's just nothing spectacular.\n\nI think it'll be a while before I go back. The service is crap, the food is mediocre at best and it's expensive. For 3 adults and kid to eat, it cost about $50 without the \""all you can eat\"". When it comes down to it, I just don't see this experience or food being worth that much!"
0,"Service was alright. At first I ordered the beef tips but that had more fat on them than meat and the taste otherwise was ok. I returned this for the ribs which did \""fall off the bone\"" and are somewhat tasty provided you add a heap of bbq sauce with them. The sides I ordered were the mac and cheese and dirty rice. *sigh* the mac and cheese was watery and bland and the rice was dry and tasteless. The manager came out and introduced himself which I thought was nice. The best part of my meal was the strawberry lemonade I ordered which reminded me of koolaid 0_o. Now on to my husband's meal... he ordered the brisket which came out looking like SPAM! Lol this place is mediocre at best and everything tasted as if it was frozen then warmed up in the microwave.. yuck. Needless to say the facility was pretty clean which is always a plus. Now the best part... Me and my husband are still having the runs from eating at this place 5 days ago. Never again smh."
1,"Well, I pretty much love NYPD Pizza. Calzones are my favorite. I've been ordering the Frank Sinatra with various fillings for years. Absolutely adore the Ricotta and I was extremely happy when they introduced the small size...which is still big enough for 2 meals. I do enjoy the pizza but in my personal opinion, it's better as takeout and then being baked again in your oven...I prefer it a little crispier, pretty much always get pepperoni and basil...occasionally throwing in pineapple. Also get ranch with everything...I'm not huge on ranch but I would bathe in the ranch from NYPD Pizza. The cheesy garlic knots are also phenomonal!"
0,"What a hot mess of a place. \nThe outside facade and the entry way are one design. Then you walk in to what reminds me of a college cafeteria- salsa bar, soda fountain, and random loud music blaring. And I mean RANDOM- from Ginuwine's Pony, to Coldplay, to Tejano. \nThe lines to order were a bit confusing for a first timer even with the signs. It was hard to hear the servers with the enormously deep counters. And the counters were so tall that I had to stand on my tippy toes and yell and point at the food that I wanted to order. \nThe bar is so tiny and it holds like 4 stools. Not a place to sit and unwind with your friends.\nThe total for my 2 gran tacos and a water was $12. Now that is not a good deal in my opinion. \nIt was just too much for too little. Not my ideal spot for a meal."
1,"I drive all the way from Tucson to Tempe to see Erika.  \n\nI wanted hair that was a bit edgy but would allow me to maintain my regular job.  I was having trouble finding this.  One stylist put blond streaks all over my head that looked nothing like the photos I had shown the stylist.  Another salon asked if I was in a rock band or an artist.  Since my profession didn't fit into a \""creative\"" category, I was denied.  I didn't get this attitude when I visited Grooming Humans.\n\nErika was able to get rid of those Barbie doll blond streaks and put me back to my regular dark brown color.  On top of that she put in blood red peek-a-boo streaks.  She does custom mixes and has any Crayola color you wish.  What is great about the style she suggested is that I don't have roots that show right away.  On top of that, she uses this toner which makes the color stay longer than when I've attempted to dye at home.  While the salon is a bit pricey, I don't have to go that often.\n\nThe disadvantage of this salon is the parking.  Better bring a pocketful of quarters as you'll have to use a meter or a pay lot to park."
0,Sooo got delivery for two grilled ham and cheese. What we got was two ham and cheese subs. Called the location back nicely and told them that the order was not correct. The girl got straight attitude with me saying that I ordered subs and that she read my order back to me. She insisted I was not correct. Told her that she can fix the problem or I would gladly back charge my credit card. She tell me she will bring us the corrected order but that she is picking up the subs and we better not have eaten them! Haha ok you can have the uneaten subs... We didn't eat them anyways cause it is not what is ordered. What a joke. Won't be returning here for my weekly deliveries after this poor customer service.
0,"I had nearly forgotten what a fish wrapper the last remaining daily newspaper in Phoenix really is...until I started sneezing again while trying to read it on my last trip to the Valley of the Sun.\n\nTrying to read this rag (apparently printed on the toilet paper quality newsprint, using some sort of \""ink\"" that causes massive nasal irritation, smears, rubs off and immediately blackens my hands and stains my clothes) is an exercise in frustration.\n\nWhile the paper itself is physically unappealing, the actual content is almost unreadable...I have not seen so many typos, grammatical errors and factual misstatements since the last time I wrote a business plan!\n\nBut, my business isn't reporting...or writing...or even advertising!\n\nIn theory, that is the business of the AZ Republic.\n\nEspecially reporting!\n\nI read about the Fiesta Bowl Fiasco investigation this morning...what a blockbuster!\n\nI read about all the shenanigans that were known for years to everyone even peripherally around the people involved in the Fiesta Bowl...everyone except the publisher of the AZ Republic who was on the Fiesta Bowl Executive committee.\n\nI didn't read about a bunch of other Fiesta Bowl stuff that I've heard about for years...they must still be \""investigating\"".\n\nI expect that the publisher thought that all the free trips, free tickets, free hookers and blow and the rest of the swag were handed out just because he, Russell, and John were such cool guys!\n\nOf course, that's just rumor...I'm no investigative journalist...but then I'm not sure they have any of those at the Republic, either.\n\nI understand that newspapers are in some trouble...they haven't, by and large, figured out how to change their business model to adapt to the new paradigm...they were caught off guard (much like Russell in an ambush interview yesterday).\n\nBut the \""solutions\"" being deployed by the Republic to try to \""save\"" their paper (poor quality paper and ink: major cuts to reporting and editorial staff, creative content and more) are reminiscent of every other business that has missed the signs of changing times and then cut everything useful in a effort to save dollars and their hides.\n\nIt kind of makes me wonder what else they missed.\n\nAt the end of the day, this paper, like many others, will likely rest on the scrapheap of broken businesses along with the telegraphs that used to bring important news from far away places and the Smith Corona's they used to use to type their stories."
1,Florists can be a huge gamble but this one delivered the same day I ordered and the flowers were incredible. Very fresh and lasted for a week. I will definitely use them again and recommend them to you.
1,The Monetary is amazing we love the spinach enchilada
0,"I want to love this place.  The location is great, the view is nice, the staff seem nice, and the prices are reasonable.  However, the food needs serious work.  The dessert menu needs to be replaced entirely.  I tried the mud pie and it was a huge slab of very hard frozen ice cream - not good.  I also tried the caprese salad the other day.  The tomatoes could have used more basil but were ok.  On the other hand, the small balls of mozzarella were far too numerous.  I would rather have a few chunks of better cheese.  The whole salad was covered in cheap (gross) Parmesan cheese (as was the bread).  This stuff is not cheese.  It has no taste and it doesn't belong on a caprese salad in the first place.  I suppose some Parmigiano reggiano could have been ok, but if that is too expensive, skip it.  I will be back, because I have been waiting for a neighborhood place, but please work on the food.  Good food does not have to be super expensive, but it takes some care with ingredients and preparation.    I hope to update my rating with at least another star in the near future - if not, I am sad to say, it won't matter because this restaurant will be gone."
0,"My husband liked this place, & it wasn't for me.\n\nThe restaurant was really tiny,  The service was fast & the food came out quickly, but the pork was really weird that came in the ramen. The noodles were good, & so was the fried rice. But the pork made me gag, and I normally like pork.\n\nNot what I was expecting. Neither of us would go back."
0,"I had asked a co-worker for a good steakhouse in the area and Johnny's was suggested highly.\n\nWell, I was sorely disappointed with the food. The service was okay.\nThe drunkin steak was over cooked(asked for med-rare, got medium). The broccoli was slightly mushy. The best thing about the plate was the garlic sauce under the steak and it made the steak edible.\n\nI will not suggest Johnny's to anyone."
0,"Really poor work. I took two pairs of pants here because I needed them quickly and my normal tailor was closed. Both pair were expensive and had never been hemmed. \nJose is a nice guy, but they really did a hack job. When I picked them up there were still threads hanging from them. Of course, I failed to bring the shoes that they used when measuring my length, therefore I couldn't try them for fit. \nWhen I got home and tried them it was clear that they were at least 3/4\"" short. Unfortunately I had a flight the next morning and had no chance to go back for the next few weeks. I was so disgusted that I took them to another tailor who had a hard time hemming them to the proper length since Jose had cut them too short. \nStay away from this place."
1,"I've been going here for years. First, it started in the 1990s with pizza and wings takeout.  Their wings are the best.  I usually get medium.   Wed and Thurs nights are currently my favorite.  Wed is $6 large cheese pizza night, and Thurs is wing night.  The service, at least when I have gone, has always been polite and attentive.  Food is delivered in a reasonable time.  I mainly eat int he restaurant, but have been in the bar.  I also have tried their pasta, and their spaghetti is awesome, as well as their lasagne. Their subs are great too, except the Phili cheese steak  is not quite a Phili...more just a cheese steak with yellow cheese and no mushrooms or peppers, but is still pretty good. The bar has a burger and beer special for $5, and the burger is great."
1,I like their beer...seriously.
1,The speedway is fun.  Parking was pretty easy to get in and out of and the racing I got to see last year was a lot of fun.  We sat in some luxury boxes and were served free food and drinks (including beer if that's what you wanted).  I ate until I was full and had a great view of the action.  I do not have any comment on prices of food and beverage because mine was all free since I got some free VIP tickets through my work.
1,Had Happy Hour on Monday at the Borgata location.\nLoved the appetizers.The ceviche is outstanding. \nHad the Quesadilla with Chicken (very good) and the tacos with pork. Delish!\nI had the berry margarita. Loved it. My husband has a beer.Beer was OK. There are better brews in Phoenix. \nService was very good.\nWill be back!
0,"One of the worse experiences I've had at Bath and Body Works. First of all, the store reeked of their new fragrance when I walked through the doors. I was in the store for five minutes and my clothes lingered with that scent. In addition, the scent was so strong that I got a headache. Ouch.\n\nYeah, I like Bath and Body Works stores, but there was  way too much body spray or perfume around that entrance door!\n\nI still like the Mango Mandarin and the Pumpkin lotions at Bath and Body Works."
1,"This was my first time here, and to be honest I'm not one to afford much more than wal-mart or super cuts but I have never been happy and NEVER go back! But I Got a coupon out of the local Surprise paper for HOT DESERT HAIR, made the appointment with Cheryl and WOW, WOW, WOW!   Its not just the hair cut that is the first in YEARS that I have LOVED ......but the service too! She knew I was nervous and  went above and  beyond to make me comfortable.. I wish I could have tipped more! I have to go back and HIGHLY recommend her!\n\nThanks Again Cheryl!"
0,"I hate to write a bad review but this place really rubbed me the wrong way, About a year ago i was looking for a 5-Series BMW and they had one online, i went to check it out, and they were not exactly on the ball, they took forever to find the keys, didn't know much about the car ect..which was ok, that was not a big deal. I came home and i called the owner and asked him about the car, he said it was in perfect condition and had never been in an accident and he's give me a good deal on it, mind you this was the OWNER of the dealership, i asked him about the car fax report and he said he would supply it and that it was clear! \n\nSo just to double check i ran a carfax and it came out clean, but then i ran an AUTO CHECK *similar to carfax but more detailed* and found out this car had gone through the auction as a suspected salvage vehicle, mind you the car did not have a salvage title or anything so i don't understand what the exact issue was but obviousley THERE WAS AN ISSUE which the owner tried to hide from me, now if i would have bought this vehicle then tried to sell it a few years later i would have been screwed on resale value when this came up! \n\nI hope euro imports does not try to do this to all its customers because sooner rather than later their reputation will be ruined...worse than it already is!"
1,"Fresh, Flavorful and the service was Friendly!*\n\nThe Scenario:\nVisiting Scottsdale for the weekend and found myself craving sushi after working all day on a Saturday (I know, I know). It was about 9pm, I was starving so I Yelped what was in the area and found Dozo. A quick call and I was able to place an order that was ready five minutes after I got there (to be fair they told me it would take 20 minutes and it only took them 15). \n\nThe Pick Up: \nA friendly hostess greeted me when I arrived and showed me where I could wait. A few newspapers were lined up so I had something to read while I waited. One of the servers stopped by to see if I needed anything to drink. He knew exactly what order I was waiting for and told me that the sushi chef was making it then. The sushi chef overheard us and waved. My wait was less than five minutes and I was out the door with very reasonably priced sushi in hand. \n\nThe Food: \nAs I mentioned above, the sushi was very fresh, flavorful and quite tasty. I didn't go crazy and try unique rolls since I didn't have a menu with me when I ordered. But I appreciated the unique twist to average rolls. Even the veggie roll offered vegetables beyond the normal ones you see. If I lived in the area, I would be there all the time. \n\nThis review was brought to you by the letter \""F\""."
1,"So Yelp is so solid an' rarely lies on stuff it's so great! \n\nI moved to Phoenix in the recent past and of course needed a new \""go to barber\"". I am MUCH MORE particular than the average guy I guess when it comes to haircuts so I think that should say a lot for those who aren't and need a solid cut.\n\nTHe first time I went I decided to go with Arsen(he cuts hair at the end furthest from the door). Not only was he good and has never disappointed since I been back, but he is even known for cutting a fair amount of famous peoples hair. Especially around Spring Training when all the ball players are around. (GO GIANTS!) =)\n\nAnyway if you want a guy who will fade your hair perfectly, do exactly what you want, AND even suggest ideas as well, Arsen and Scottsdale Barber Shop is your place."
1,"Gorgeous hotel, great service (well, the daily room service was great.) If you stay here, there is no need to leave as they have everything: multiple restaurants and lots of shopping (if you're into that.) I LOVED the lobby, this is the main reason I wanted to stay here. Room had a great bed, beautiful decor and a HUGE awesome bathroom and shower.Weird comment, I know, but the humidity of the room was REALLY low and the water was REALLY hard so our stay here, albeit awesome, resulted in some dry itchy and unpleasant skin. Definitely stay here if looking for something more upscale and romantic. If looking for fun? I'd recommend the Hard Rock Hotel. Hotel was definitely fancy!"
0,"Started out well, parmasean potato chips were yummy. The it went down hill fast. Fries and onion straws were luke warm and laden with grease. Burgers are definitely frozen and not fresh. Concept is cute but quality is poor. Save your money."
1,"My family and I went to this buffet as part of the Buffet of Buffets package. Of the seven different buffet options this by far was the best. The quality of the food was great. The food options are a little bit limited as compared to other buffets, but everything they serve was cooked right. The desert bar was extensive with the best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I have tasted. This buffet also offers fresh crepes which can be topped with your choice of toppings. Get there early because the line can get long. It could take upwards of an hour before you get seated. Definitely a \""Don't Miss in Las Vegas\""!"
1,"Great place to go eat and listen to music. Ive been here a couple of times and the food and service was awesome ,recently came to watch the world cup game and had a blast i definitely recommend this place whether to eat watch a game or just spend time with family ."
1,"We were driving through Phoenix and found this place on Yelp. The outdoor patio was lovely, though it was too hot to sit outside at 5:00 p.m. The food was wonderful: a delicious and generous helping of burata, meatballs, and an arugala salad as good as any I've had.  The service was cheerful and efficient."
0,"Qdoba was recommended through a co-worker who assured me they were \""just as good as Chipotle\"". Well, being just across Thomas and 10-15 minutes closer made it infinitely more convenient. Almost walkable, if you don't mind getting flattened by the new Light Rail whizzing by. As Stephen Wright says, \""Anywhere is walking distance....if you have the time.\""\n\nWell......about halfway through my fajita ranchera burrito, I'm already sadly disappointed. Taste, quality and price are all below my precious Holy Sepulchre of the Chipotle temple. \n\nFirst off, I decided to try the fajita, since it's what I get from (angels sing) Chipotle, so it would make the best comparison. I always ask for, and get, some extra peppers/onions for a perfect, albeit \""Chain\"", burrito. So I was a little shocked by the \""We'll have to charge you for that\"" response. \n\nFor about 4 pieces of pepper and onion. No joke. Hard times, Qdoba??\n\nThe rice is thinner and smaller than Chipotle's, and the burrito instantly fell apart. I guess they need to send their employess to the same rolling-and-folding school that Chipotle includes in their tuition reimbursement benefits.\n\nThe final price was over $9, 2 bucks more then I pay at Chipotle for the same - no, better - food.\n\nSorry, Qdoba, Jeffrey doesn't want burritos with good taste, he wants burritos that taste good! (and cost less)"
1,"The Atmosphere: Dark, modern, but welcoming. There are about ninety elevated flat screens, with every game and the omnipresent SportsCenter. The bar area is spaced out very well, so everyone is not right on top of one another. The bar is a good size wrap around type.\n\nThe Service: Excellent. Each time I've been in I've received personal service from friendly wait staff or bartenders. The managers greet customers as well, and the staff seems to be a great team.\n\nThe Food: Good. Nothing mind blowing, but above average. Fresh meat, good sauces, and good veggies. You don't come here for a culinary experience anyway, but you'll leave full and happy. \n\nThe Drinks: Good prices even outside of happy hour. Small tap selection, but this is Gilbert. They have chilled mugs, which is cool. \n\nOverall: Blue 32 exceeds my expectations whenever I go in. All in all, it provides a cool sports bar contrast to the pub next door."
1,I plan on staying here in January at a 2bedroom hospitality suite.  I am mainly asking the reviewer below if he has any pics or could you describe the room?  The website sadly only has 1 picture and no floor plan.\n\nthanks for your help!
1,I like this place.  I have been to the location on west Sahara several times.  I just went to the north Rainbow location and it was actually better than the Sahara location!  The only thing that would earn more stars would be the inconsistent service.  Sometimes it is great and other times it is just ok.
0,"I've stayed twice at NYNY and I went once with my hubby and sister in law and it was NOT authentic CHINESE food but watered down American style...  I mean hello have you guys ever heard of GINGER or GARLIC?!?!?\n\nI went again with my parents this past Feb and my mom was craving rice ( go figure :p) and I took em there.   \n\n* EGGPLANT\nHot and spicy blend of Japanese eggplant, purple onions,\nscallions and garlic.  - The eggplant was pretty good, it had much flavor and I think they actually put garlic in this one.. \n.. TEMPURA SHRIMP / shrimp tempura / avocado / cucumber / burdock / radish /  = \nThe sushi roll was delish.  In Canada, this is called Dynamite Roll but is the US Dynamite is always something different in every place I have been to.

Nice sauce on it as well. \n\n\nSHRIMP WITH SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE - Plump deep fried shrimp, red bell peppers, onions and pineapple chunks with sweet and sour sauce.\nThis was normal and typical.. the sauce was bleh... just sour lol"
0,"FOLLOW UP :  The Guest Service Management contacted me and they have been very kind, helpful and friendly.  They have offered us another try.  We will return next year and I will let you know how it goes:)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concierge staff is all a bit snotty, they should be a lot more personable.  I don't understand why it is so difficult to help you.  They should have jumped on the issue with the Strawberry delivery, taken ownership and called guest services and the front desk for me.  They should anticipate my needs rather than me having to pull their teeth out to have my needs met.  \n\nDear Mr. Adelson, \nMy husband and I recently stayed at the Palazzo Hotel in Las Vegas with two close friends of ours.  We stayed from Friday to Monday and they were in their room, from Saturday to Monday.  I have stayed at Venetian a number of times in the past.  As well, we have stayed at the Bellagio, the Green Valley Resort and other hotels too, as we come to Las Vegas 1-2 times a year at the very least.  \nI am writing to you because we had a number of negative incidents occur during our stay. As the former Assistant Manager of Visitor Services for the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, as well as a concierge and front desk agent at five star properties in California including the Sonoma Mission Inn and Spa, I know what to expect from a luxury hotel.  I did not receive the service that I expected from the team members at the Palazzo.  \nThe following issues came up during our stay.  \n1.  Because our friends were celebrating birthdays while staying with you, we pre-arranged a delivery from Sherries Berries.  The chocolate covered strawberries never made it to our friends.  Although, they were signed for by an employee of yours, M. RIVERA at approximately 10:15 am on Saturday, December 3.   I called your concierge to inquire about this delivery and was told that they don't handle deliveries like this.  I was then transferred to the guest services department.  They told me that the item had never been delivered.  They then sent me back to the front desk and I was told the same thing.\n2. We ended up having to have your concierge deliver another gift of balloons and truffles to them.  I was disappointed as this was now Sunday and they were leaving on Monday and unable to take the balloons on the plane.  The concierge said they would be in their room when they returned from lunch at 1:30.  We returned after 2pm and they were not there.  I called down and was told that the florist didn't have a key.  Apparently, the concierge didn't deliver it him or herself...was this because there was no tip for them too as it was a phone order?  I don't know.  \n3. Speaking of the concierge, I was looking for tickets to the Sunday showing of the new Michael Jackson show at the Mandalay Bay.  I had done some research at home so I knew there were still some $50 tickets available.  I figured the concierge at a luxury resort could help us.  Well, we met the not so friendly concierge on Saturday afternoon.  We asked him about tickets to the show, he grunted and took a look.  He told us there were TWO prices ....70 something and 100 something.  I told him that no, we had seen that there are $50 tickets.  Well, he insisted that there were not any of this sort and he couldn't help us.  We went to our room; I used my iPhone and purchased 2 x $50 tickets.  Seems to me the concierge wanted a commission and there must not have been one on the $50 tickets?\n4. Who in the world decided to block the entire entrance to the hotel from the lobby with the Stiletto Race?  There was barely any walk space alongside the viewers, the tables were blocked and we had to walk all around to get where we wanted to go.   We tried to leave for the KA show at 5:45 But, getting out of the hotel proved to be a pain in the -s.  We eventually got to the taxi line and it took us a good half an hour to get through the line.  We barely made the show.  Why on earth did this get scheduled at such a ridiculous location and why were the guests not warned about how long it would go on and how difficult getting out would be?  \n5. Sunday: Your front desk agents could have averted all this stress by informing us when we checked in that there were a number of events including the Marathon that would cause travel issues.  The entire strip was closed!  Why was there no notification in the Palazzo about this?  We had tickets to Michael Jackson.  We left at 5pm to grab a taxi downstairs.  We learned that there were none.  It took us two hours. We almost missed it.\n6. Last but not least, our room was lovely but there were some details that needed to be addressed; it took 5 minutes to warm up the shower, the vanity mirror bulb was out and the lamp next to my bed did not work either.  I had the mirror replaced but, then didn't want to have to call again for the light.  These things need to be checked regularly in a hotel of this calib"
0,"I have been to the factory in Phoenix - wasn't the least bit impressed.  My family wanted to try this one - I was hoping for the best, but yet again I was disappointed.  Its like another Olive Garden with everything premade so its nothing special and you can't customize anything.  Its only the way on the menu and thats it - no special orders.  I dont know what the big hype is with this place, this isn't real Italian and its nothing to write home about, there was nothing to be impressed with from the soups to the lame salads to the meal - all was mediocre and if you ask me they charge to much for the quality of the food. I got the ravioli - totally lacked flavor and their marinara is bland as well. Now that I have had both places I hope to NEVER return - the food sucks."
1,Good food ! Jesus is an excellent waiter and he is on top of his game. We did not need to ask for anything
0,"This place is a real feast for the eyes. We sat right in front of a water feature that ran the full length of the front dining room. And the service was exceptional. But the food? A solid meh. I'd give them a meh+ for the great, friendly service.\n\nThey do tableside guacamole which was pretty good. I expected a little more presentation however. If you aren't going to do that, just schlep it out from the kitchen like everything else. \n\nCarnitas were rather tasty but no real depth of flavor. For a \""signature dish\"" my level of expectation was much higher. Churros! Get them!! Served warm with banana ice cream and caramel sauce. You don't want to miss these. Do like we did and stop in just for the churros. You'll thank me.\n\nCompared to most of the restaurants in Vegas their prices weren't too high. But there's way too much great food in Vegas these days. I can't imagine this is Diego's A-game."
0,"I think this place was more style of substance.  My husband and I could not find what we were looking for, and the menu was no where near what you would expect from a sushi restaurant , very limited selection with the rolls. And I would have expected better food than what we paid for.\n\nOne other thing the hostess greeted us and told us that it would be a 15 min. wait to be seated in the restaurant, and that we should grab a drink at the bar.  As soon as we walked over to the bar I see a group leave some table, and tell my husband lets go there and sit and wait.  While waiting the waitress Victoria comes up and says that we could order dinner here too.  So that it what we did which was fine.  The only things is the hostess never came back to check up on us to see where we were.  I really think that's poor hostessing skills."
1,"Should be 3.5 stars, but went with 4 to help the ratings for a new restaurant.  Came here with some friends and tried out different dishes on Friday evening.  Left pretty full and satisfied, but going to give them a little more time.\n\nFOOD - Overall, everything tasted pretty good.  Nothing that will leave me craving to go back as of writing this, heh.\n\nCarpaccio:  So I'm not a carpaccio person but felt like giving it a whirl, and I like it.  If you're not sure what it is, go wiki/google it up!  Probably preference choice, but I don't need the massive flatbread and tons of grated cheese on it.\n\n[_] Risotto:  This was a very good dish.  I forget what it was called but it was the mushroom-shrimp risotto.  All the flavors stood out quite well and it was not too soup-like.\n\nShrimp Flatbread, Lobster Bisque, & Tagliatelle w/ Olive Oil and sun-dried tomatoes (and other stuff) were all pretty good, but nothing memorable of the bunch.  That is to say though, I was somewhat disappointed with the Tagliatelle dish.  The nice thing about this place is FRESH PASTA (like in Italy), but the dish itself just didn't pop.  I went with the olive oil as sauce to really taste the pasta itself.  Can't pinpoint why the pasta dish was lacking... I'm going to give it another go though.  \n\nSERVICE - This needs some help, and they get a pass for that.  While the service staff was friendly, they did not seem experienced in the restaurant industry.  Some pointers:  Awkward for hostess to stand near door and just kinda extend her arm to open the door without moving.  I'd rather she move around and open the door for us OR just let us come in.  The half-hearted attempt doesn't work.  Saw the chef cooking our flatbread pizza, and as he put it into the oven, bro was scratching his beard..kinda unappetizing, right?  Open-viewing kitchen = people are going to be watching you guys!  Server was too casual--stood really close to my buddies.  Granted, she was cute and all, but you can't get up all in someone's personal space.  We were giving her our order and by the third item, she was like, Hold on, let me get something to write on. 5 items isn't too much, is it?  I'm being hyper-critical to provide constructive criticism.  Usually other than beard follicles potentially in the flatbread, the rest I could live with and not mind.\n\nAMBIANCE - Restaurant is gorgeous.  The perfect place to take some out-of-towners in my opinion.  Located in Epicentre, it's a great place to just walk around and see a bunch of stuff then grab a meal here.  Huge windows to see Epicentre patrons walking by.  Kudos to the design of the place.\n\nOh yeah, DESSERT - the Sorbetta di Limon (spelling way off), was the perfect way to end the meal.  It's a lighter dessert to balance out and finish off heavy Italian cuisine.  \n\nDespite everything, I want to go back here for lunch.  Just looking at the investment put into the place, makes me believe that they will certainly improve the quality of food and service by throwing a few more dollars into those areas. \n\ndmo out."
1,I have enjoyed Postino's for a long time.  The Monday and Tuesday night madness are for those who have the patience to have a great deal.  This location is great due to the patio and indoor seating.  I've always enjoyed the prosciutto with brie sandwich.  Try to bring cash when possible for valet.. Parking can get pretty crazy.  \nService is always Outstanding!  Worth the drive and wait!
0,"Do not go to this show with any expectations for anything other than topless women and acrobatics.  The women are beautiful and capable of amazing flexibility, let's just say that.\n\nOn the other hand, the \""humor\"" is raunchy (which they warned us about) and not a bit funny (which they didn't).  The attempt at a story line is a shambles.  It involves odd and unclear connections to some randomly-selected children's fairy tales.  The music appeared to be pre-recorded, since no musicians were visible or acknowledged.  And I'm not entirely sure the vocals weren't pre-recorded either.\n\nAnd here's the part that finally killed it for me:  The lead actress (not Holly) ended the show by literally demanding that everyone in the audience rise up and give the cast a standing ovation!  Never before, in my entire theater-going life, have any performers ended any show by asking the audience to give them a standing ovation.  How pathetic.\n\nAs far as Holly Madison:  Her role isn't minimal, and she's onstage a fair amount, but it is very tightly scripted and controlled, with none of the spontaneity that we all loved about her in The Girls Next Door.  A little audience interaction or Q&A would have gone a long way, and whoever decided not to trust her to just be herself, for at least some small part of this production, is a fool.\n\nIn fairness, a lot of people seemed to enjoy the show.  But the couple in front of us walked out before it was over, and we were tempted to join them."
1,Definitely one of the best meals we have had in Montreal and this is comparing it to one of the top ranking restaurant in the city.  The duck confit was succulent and the vegetables served with it complemented quite nicely.  Meals were served up with excellent attitude and smile; enough to have us return just for the level of service.  Our waitress was more than happy to accommodate us with the free and mouthwateringly delicious creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that came with dinner when it was mentioned that we had checked-in with Yelp.  Did I mention the free and lively entertainment just steps from our table?  I just don't get why this restaurant ranks only four stars.
0,"Three of us went here on a Tuesday evening at around 6:30. We were greeted by the hostess and shown to our seats. That was it. 15 minutes later after no one aknowledged that we were there except for the hostess who kept on sneaking into the kitchen and coming back out pretending not to chew on something.\n\nWe slowly got up and left. No staff even noticed.\n\nI can understand if they were packed, but not even close."
1,"We just love this place, food & service is great!! Only problem is they price thier wine like they do at Bella Luna!  When we want wine w/pizza we go to NYPD, they have good wine prices. You can't expect people to pay $10 for a pizza & then pay $24 or more for wine. They need a wine priced between $16 & $20.  We would go more often for dinner, we only go there for lunch on the weekends."
1,"I love spicy foods but they are not kidding when they write CAUTION all over the menu next to the habanero burger. It is absolutely ridiculous. My boyfriend has a really high tolerance for spice and he could even eat the whole thing... but a day later he called me and said he wouldn't be ordering it again because digesting it was painful.... hahaha. I could only eat half of the habanero burger the first time I went so the second time, I just got a regular burger with bleu cheese. Was delicious though... can't wait to go back and try some other things on the menu.\n\nHappy hour prices are great!"
0,"I am updating this review rating as the General Manager contacted me directly, so am appreciative of the outreach. Has anyone else tried? Let me know if I was way out of line with my review."
1,"Whipped in here for lunch today & got situated in a comfortable booth for my first ever visit to this Macayo's.  It's a big, very nicely styled place, & I ordered from the \""Mex & Match\"" special menu that's available on weekdays.  You choose 1 or 2 main items & 1 or 2 sides.  Right away (even though it was noon), my server showed up with a BIG bowl of chips & a cup of their TERRIFIC chunky salsa to get me started!\n\nI ordered a Chile Relleno & a shredded beef hard taco for my main items, & Tortilla Soup & veggies for my sides.  Soon my soup arrived, chock full of chicken breast meat, avocado, cheese, & more.  This also was VERY, VERY GOOD!\n\nAt the appropriate time my main platter arrived, with a BIG Pablano Chile, stuffed with delicious Oaxaca cheese, a good-sized shredded beef taco, & a large serving of steamed vegetables, including zucchini, broccoli, carrot slices, & red bell pepper.\n\nPeople rant that, \""Ooh, it's part of a chain!\"" or \""Ooh it's Gringoized, Americanized Mexican food\"", or whatever.  What a bunch of caca toro!  Get your burro & get over here ahorita, because this place is \u00a1CINCO ESTRELLAS, PERIODO!     :-))\n\nMex & Match with 4 items \u00a1precio barato! a $8.79."
1,"I LOVE this place. I have been coming here for a few years now for pedicures and while I'm not a frequent visitor, every time I come I have a great experience. I agree with other reviewers that Jean is just awesome at doing pedicures. I love this place because it is clean and sanitary and the staff are always friendly and do a good job. The prices are pretty much the same as the (lesser) competition in the neighborhood so it's a no-brainer for me. I wouldn't go anywhere else anymore for my pedicures."
1,"My GF and I ordered the shrimp wanton soup, beef curry over rice, and the #1 (i don't remember exactly what it was called but it had chicken with 2 sauces with rice) for ~18.\n\n- The price of a McDonald's value meal, maybe less! Real cheap! around 5 bucks each. Good portion too! \n- A taste you can't complain about! kinda...haha\n     - The soup comes with 8 wantons, which we ordered. If you opted for the noodles, then you get only 5. Needs more soup to compensate for all that wanton. \n     - The beef curry was my favorite. I highly recommend it! The beef is very tender. The waiter told me they bake it for 7-9 hours! Comes with lots of curry, so i needed more rice.\n     - The #1 was alright. I loved the hot sauce, which was not too hot, but use it with the beef curry and it will be very satisfying.\n- Great service! Maybe bc we were the only ones there, but the waitress and chef talked to us and gave recommendations. They even left the water container on the table for us :)!!!\n\n^____^!"
0,"I had been here before and wasn't thrilled for the most part but some friends told me about the fish on Friday.  I sat at  the bar which was mostly regulars enjoying pleasant conversation and unwinding after the work day. Not being a regular, the bartender definitely addressed me much different and in a very sterile manner.  While I appreciate a hard earned vacation, I don't care to hear the bartender talk about her upcoming getaway because \""this place is making her crazy\"" with the regulars. Doesn't make a good first impression and if it's not a pleasant work environment it makes me the customer question what's coming out of the kitchen.  That was soon answered.\n\n\nThe fish, fries and slaw arrived and made a nice first impression based on appearance. That's where it ended, the fresh cut fries were barely warm and extremely limp. The cole slaw has no business being called slaw. Shredded cabbage in a bowl would be more appropriate, no flavor at all.   The two tiny corn fritters/hush puppies were beyond bland and rubbery.  \n\nNow let's discuss the fish.  It looked good, the portion was very reasonable for the price. That's where it ends. Like the fries the fish was barely warm. The fish lacked texture and flavor.  I am accustomed to a fish that has some flakiness to it. This fish was more like Mrs Paul's. \n\nI have tried lunch, fail, now dinner,fail.  I will be back to try breakfast and let you know."
0,"Ate at the Coronado location today.  Had the Vampiro Pastor. The marinated pork was moist and tasty, reminiscent of Chinese roast pork (char siu), it was piled high with all the typical fixins, but the grilled pineapple was what put it over the top. So yummy, there's no need to put salsa on it.  \n\nThe special cerviche that's only available Fri & Sat, was awful. Tasted more like they served it the week before. Decor could use some sprucing up and beware of the bees if you plan on dining outside. Even though the ambiance and cerviche were below average, I'd take a drive to get more Vampiro Pastor."
1,"I would love to give 5 stars, and if it was based off strictly food and price it would be. Very affordable and very good food. Some of my favorite fried rice in Vegas and hard to put down once you start eating. I haven't sat down to eat here yet but ordered take out a few times.\n\nIf they are not busy, take out is fairly easy as someone usually sees you walk in and comes to help you. However on busy nights such as this past Monday, I went in to pick up my food and waited about 10 minutes before someone acknowledged me being there. I then waited close to 10 minutes for them to ring me up in the back along with another guy who was there before me while our food sat there bagged up on the table. Food was still very hot when i got home so no issues there, just think they should have a dedicated \""host/ess\"" when you walk in. If you walk in now, it's like whoever is available will come over and seat you or take your order.\n\nSeemed like many of the people sitting at the restaurant were frustrated with wait times for food or service as well. Saw one guy get up and go grab the water jug from the server stand since nobody was coming to his table to refill and one table had to grab a server so that they would take the order for the table.\n\nMinus the obvious service issues on busy nights, I highly recommend this place for the food! We have enjoyed all dishes we have had and I absolutely love the fried rice."
1,I have had great experiences at the salon.  I'm surprised that this salon garners so many dollar signs...I've found them very reasonable w/ cost for cut/color and highlights.  \n\nMy fave stylist is Suzie - I know she will always have the latest in hair color/highlights as well as styles.  She really knows her craft and stays up-to-date with the trends!  I have also seen a couple other stylists at this salon and they are great as well.  The front office staff are always so helpful and friendly as well.  \n\nPlease check this salon out.
1,"Love this place.  The food is great.  Very fresh seafood, lobster roll, amazing oyster selection.  Also don't forget the aged beef!! The staff is extremely friendly and incredible looking.  We took our kids and they were very accommodating and made us feel comfortable.\n\nWe have been here twice on vacation and have loved it both times.  If you enjoy good oysters in a hip but casual atmosphere you will enjoy it."
0,"Out of all my life, I've never HATED a practice this much in my life. Whenever I call I'm on hold for 15-25 mins minimum. They call me and tell me my results are positive and then they send me a letter saying my results are negative, so which one is it then???? So I call them waited on hold just for them to tell me \""THEY DONT KNOW and that They have to call me the next day \"". Mind you I had my Pap smear January 31 and didn't get results for 2.5 weeks, and the ONLY reason I got my results by phone is because I called them 4 times, but those 4 times they told me they'd call me back, NEVER DID. and come to find out my results never came back from the lab. Then I get a letter 1 week later saying my results are normal. I go to get my medical records from them to change doctors and wait 40 mins for them to tell me they can't get it off the computer because \""they have a new system\"". The staff is absolutely horrid and inappropriate. I only went there once and they have put me through way too much. These people don't care about their patients at all."
1,"Caesar Palace finally stepped up to the plate and opened up the buffet up to meet their standards. We went on Opening Day (9-11-12) around 10am and we were told they hit max capacity and will re-open for lunch. We waited in line for them to re-open at 11am, but  many people were cutting in line. There was only 8 groups in front of us, the Bacchanal wasn't going to fill up...so we didn't care too much. Regular price for lunch was $21.95. We were seated in the glass room. Bacchanal transform their buffet area into three different theme room: steel, wood and glass and they were beautiful. \nThe staff and service was awesome. Even the staff that were serving us over the counter, they kept asking if we wanted anything else. They were ready to do anything. The food spread was massive, it kept going and going. There was so much food and so many cuisines to try... I end up stuffing myself and didn't try everything. \nThe food portion was serve similar to Wicked spoon with individual portion size. Even though its in individual plates, some portion was a little too much for myself.\nI started in the seafood area, we cocktail shrimp, oysters, clams, oyster shooters, then the fish- halibut and salmon grilled, chowder, crab cakes (YUM!). Asian area: dim sum, hot & sour soup, miso soup, duck, bbq pork, sesame ball, potstickers, stir fried veggies, fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken, korean bbq, grilled chicken, sushi and more...Italian area have many different types of pasta: lasagna, spaghetti,  variety of pizza, bread and cheese area, cold meat area, salads, and of course a Mexican area with tortillas, carnitas, homemade salsa, beans, and more. Carving station have lots of different types of meats: sausages, beef, ribs, turkey. I really like the hot link. Also the dessert station was awesome. They have a variety of cookies, cupcakes, cakes, pies, cheesecake, ice cream/gelato and fruit. \nAfter all the food we stuff into our stomach, we had cups of coffee. The coffee was flavorful, it wasn't like diluted water. Everything was great and so delicious. I totally would recommend this place to everyone and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas, especially for dinner to try the other seafood they will have."
0,"I was excited for a Wednesday date night with my boyfriend and couldn't wait to eat sushi. We chose to go to Ra and were greeted by a very kind hostess. After being seated, we waited for 20 minutes, without a server ever coming to our table. We got up and told the hostess, who said she would get the server right away. 5 more minutes went by and still no server...\nWe left and got to eat pizza instead, since nothing was open."
1,"Best FRIED CHICKEN in the city. Great Southern drinks, too!\n\nIf you're into Southern cooking, then Triple Crown is definitely worth a visit. While the Fried Chicken is my favorite, the Brisket is pretty damn good, too. Both of these and the Pulled Pork (which I haven't yet tried) are available as \""Meat and Threes\"" where you can pick 3 of several side dishes. \n\nOf all the different side dishes, I'd recommend Biscuits (best in the city), beans (made with bacon), and greens. But they're all pretty tasty.\n\nAnother great dish is the Big Nasty, which is a fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit topped with gravy. Gawd, it hits the spot.\n\nI'd also suggest trying one of their many bourbon drinks, as well as deserts -- it's kinda unfair just how good the bread pudding is."
1,First time at Pump It Up! Was a great experience bunch of fun activities for the kids ! Great place to host kids birthday parties! The only thing is their food was cold like it was sitting out for the entire party!
1,"Excellent Vibes\nThe food was Good, but rather overpriced for what it is... $14 for a grande steak burrito that would normally cost about 8 bucks elsewhere. But its Vegas.\n\nVERY PROFESSIONAL Managerial staff. Handled an issue well and treated us with utmost respect. We left here satisfied because of Bob! Thanks for the help."
0,"I stopped in here a while ago to quickly obtain a hair product. I was in a rush and put  on a wig before I went there. While I was being rung up, one of the female workers there was asking me about what was going on underneath my wig. I quickly got embarrassed and wanted to leave immediately. I was not having a great hair day but I certainly didn't expect for someone working there to be do nosy and ask me about things that don't concern them. I understand that it's a beauty supply but if I'm going there for a certain item, I don't need their workers to question me or comment on my appearance unless they are giving compliments. The person wasn't being rude but I wasn't there for my wig. I didn't ask them for any assistance regarding that. I simply wanted to get my product and leave. I purchased my item and haven't been back since and I won't ever go back because I felt offended and embarrassed. Although the person probably didn't mean to offend me, they need to stick to keeping their mouths closed when it comes to their customer's appearance unless they are asked for their opinion."
0,"Food was average, but paid double what we thought it was worth.\n\nThe bread they brought out initially was so crunchy we couldn't cut it without it cracking. Had to ask them to replace it.\n\nAlso $5 for a bottled beer..."
1,Good food for a decent price.
1,I love having 100 channels. I hate not being able to see them because of a bad signal. I also hate dodging taxis while trying to get back and forth from valet.
0,"DO NOT GO HERE! I just bought a Groupon for a VIP wash. The manager said it would take 30-45minutes to get my car through, 1.5 hours later and my car hadn't even been started on. I had to leave without them finishing my car. Next, I get in my car and the light fabric was soiled with grease stain from the tires! So now I have to figure out how to get these grease stains out of the inside of my car. \n\n*they did offer me a free wash to come back and have my car finished but is it really worth it? I don't think so.\n\nUPDATE: I did end up going back for them to clean the inside of my car. The manager was very responsive to my concerns and my car ended up looking great and they finished in a timely fashion. Should have done this the first time around and I'd be a regular customer."
1,"Was in town again this week.   Came back to check it out.   As always, the service was excellent.   Really enjoyed the house special cut and the ribeye as they were both very tasty.  Manager kept checking in along with the waitstaff   Definitely go again."
1,"Wowowowow, the food here was just delectable!\n\nI've been trying to make a reservation here with my friends the past few times, but they were always booked at least a month in advanced for dinner reservations for the Saturdays we were there.\n\nI think the best dish there was their rib-eye steak, medium rare. HUGE portion btw.  It really just melts in your mouth.  I also tried the lobster tacos for appetizer and the cobb salad.  And to drink, you can't go wrong with a white peach margarita!\n\nHats off to you Chef Bobby Flay :)"
0,"Stay away!\n\nWe had no problems on the shuttle from the airport to the hotel (Planet Hollywood), but the way back to the airport on a Sunday was a disaster.  We were quoted a pickup time of 1:40pm. At 2pm no one had shown up, so we called and were told \""We are running behind today. Someone should be there in 10 minutes.\""  Finally at 2:15, the bus showed up. And then had to stop at two other hotels before we were dropped off at the airport at the complete wrong end of the terminal.  \n\n35 minutes late is just ridiculous. I realize it's a Sunday, but plan for it. Of course it's busier. Everyone leaves on a Sunday! There was one other company that had FOUR shuttles pick up in the time we were waiting. I'll be using them next time."
0,"In the interest of full disclosure, understand that I have a natural aversion to all things redneck. In fact, the second star is only because I try to reserve 1 star ratings for places that genuinely mistreat me, which they haven't done. Am I not merciful? AM I NOT MERCIFUUUUUL!?!?!?!?! Still, you can take the rest of this with a grain of salt. What I might hate about the place may be exactly what makes you a fan.\n\nMusic: Over-played, asinine generic Top-40 and hip-hop with trite lyrics (usually about doing the sort of things you're probably doing at \""da club\"", but on a tighter budget) mixed awkwardly with contemporary country, i.e. the worst kind of country. All of which is played at a volume that leads one to wonder if Dale Jr. has some bizarre profit motive for rattling vital organs out of his customers' rib cages. \n\nDrinks: Standard variety of beer and spirits you'll find anywhere people go to get hammered. I don't remember anything noteworthy enough for praise or criticism. The prices were a little high but no more than what you should expect for uptown.\n\nAmenities: This is where Whisky River does best. The dance floor is pretty large and the bar is long enough that you MIGHT not have a sea of humanity separating you from the bartender each time you go for another drink. The floor to ceiling window looking down onto Trade Street is pretty cool too. The mechanical bull is, well...a mechanical bull. If you'll forgive the lazy tautology, it is what it is, a means of allowing (or tricking) hot drunk girls to be sexually provocative. As a straight male, it's kinda hard to criticize too much.\n\nClientele: Imagine a large group of out-of-town NASCAR fans of all ages who, in desperation for a big night out in an unfamiliar city, find themselves at a night club...on college night. Maybe throw in some townies in Ed Hardy shirts and pointy black leather shoes and there you have it.  \n\nSo if you can stand a couple hours of ear-splitting T-Pain, Nickelback, and Jason Aldean without envying the deaf this place may be for you. However, if you need me I'll be at Connolly's or Belfast Mill."
0,"After reading the reviews on yelp and then eating there I am losing my faith in the collective wisdom of yelp.\nFirst the chips and salsa; very bland and watered down salsa. Next the chille relleno; tasteless. I have had better tasting Mexican food in Berlin, Germany. \nService was friendly and a good Margarita. Inecpensive as well."
0,"Wish I could give \""0\"" stars for this Home Depot. The worst Home Depot in the system, never have any of the typical parts or hardware. Avoid this Home Depot at all costs!!!!! 30 minutes wasted at this store hearing the employee tell me how bad the manager is - with no results!!!!!!!\nHorrible!!!!"
0,"I don't know why this place has amazing reviews. It has the typical signs of success: meager frame, limited customer service, few choices, and relatively inexpensive. The problem is Tacos Atoyac does not deliver in food quality. The hotdog was the best that I tried from the menu mostly due to the interest of avocado. The burrito was boring and really needed the sauces to cover up the dry meat. The sauces did not even come in a significantly spicy variety. Not what I was expecting and I must say I am disappointed."
0,"I absolutely LOVE the Blanco's in north Tucson. The food is fabulous, the views are incredible and the service is impeccable. The Scottsdale location is not so great. My husband and I went here for an early dinner one night and we waited for a table for what felt like an eternity (even though there were only like 6 other diners) and our waitress frequently forgot about us. Then to top it off, I got sick after eating my tacos! My husband enjoyed his meal and his margarita but we won't return."
0,"Without being over the top here, I have a feeling the corporate culture of this company is corrupt. What they tell you and when they tell you appears to be dictated by what they can make, not what you need. I am not much of a review poster, but between my own experience, friends experience, and people I know who have worked there.......stay away!!!\n\nNo, seriously, doing business with these people might just be taking your life for granted.  My experience is related to tire and alignment issues. Over the course of 10 months and over the course of 3 weeks, the story, the recommendations and the warranty changed like the wind. At Your Own Risk!!!   Not even sure they perform the services you contract for while sitting in the waiting Area.  Bad news. Again, at your own risk."
1,This location is nice quiet and clean. Employees are extremely courteous. Although parking here can be very difficult due to the numerous businesses in this location there is an underground parking structure but who wants to park there right? \n\nCoffee is pretty decent here and my 7 year old loves the cookies here.
0,"My roomie and i went to this place. The server was okay but with as many people as there were in the place- we really waited quite some time for our 1st drinks about 10-15 minutes.. approx. We ordered the tornadoes poppers and they were prettty good except for the chilis needed to be cooked thru more-- they were a bit hard which made them REALLY hot which really it is supposed to just have a nice \""BITE\"".  So, the cook didnt cook them properly... Also, i ordered brisket and it was actually pretty tender but NO FLAVOR... They are using the wrong chips to smoke this. THey need to watch Robert Irvine's shows & food network. Almond chips do best with brisket.. My roomie ordered the barb ribs-again NO FLAVOR - they are not cooking them correctly - but overall - salad was delicious.  Waitress then forgot about the beer my friend ordered and he had to reorder it from her. He sat and waiting for about 15 minutes more... that was really ridiculous. The server was in the back of the kitchen talking to her friends... The manager gave me a drink which was nice that he helped out-- but why didnt he wonder where my waitress was???  We were going to give her a 21 percent tip to be nice then it dropped to 18 percent because she dropped the bill off and then left for 20 minutes... and my roommate had to catch a plane in the morning at 6a.m. so we needed to leave.  He wont be back again- but i may go again to listen to the music."
1,"Best burger I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of burgers.  I had a Kobe Beef burger with potato chips (on the burger) and thousand island on a PERFECT bun.  Cannot wait to go back."
1,"We came here friday morning for crepes to celebrate my daughters birthday. We got the nutella/strawberry crepe, and the ricotta/citrus/berry jam crepe, they were delicious, large and had plenty of filling. My daughter wanted a caramel macchiato, and the lovely young woman who took our order suggested the caramel latte, since their macchiato was different than what starbucks has, so we ordered both. The latte was good and the macchiato looked good, in a tiny espresso cup, yet I didnt like its flavor so woulnt order again. Since it was her birthday, my daughters drink was free, and she loved the writing on the cup, which was just the drinks name, but very artistic.Great way to start her birthday! (they also had some delicious looking pastries!)"
1,"Anybody that knows truly good tasting NY style pizza knows that this is a legitimate pizza joint somehow located in Scottsdale, AZ. I'm from the NYC area and live off of pizza. This place gets two thumbs up for the quality of their food. It is just a bonus that it is open late night as well. I guess that's a good way to make extra money but all the items on their menu besides the pizza are top notch and would be perfect for anyone that truly knows quality when they are tasting it at any time of day. Those that don't know quality are people that eat at chain pizza joints and think that California Pizza Kitchen is the best. CPK isn't bad for fast food pizza but it is nothing like legitimate NYC tasting pizza. Bonus points for using Grande Cheese and not being cheap and using a less quality cheese just to save money!"
0,"For my daughter's Birthday she wanted to go shopping and get sushi. I'm not a huge sushi fan but I'm coming around. I do however love noodles! We decided to try Jade because of the review we've read.\n\nThe service was good but there was only 3 other tables in use at the time. Location is great. I guess we should have suspected something when we heard beach music coming out the sound system.\n\nThe table started with Edamame. It was fine. My daughter said the Miso soup was OK (she has had better). The Rainbow Roll was good by my standards but the others said it was just OK. The rolls did not stay together like they should have. A sign that they did not know how to roll sushi or just didn't care. Either way that should tell the owners they should take a long hard look at their staff. The Jonah Roll, I believe it was, was very good. The Udon Noodle was terrible! It tasted like dirty dish water that  someone put a lot of fish sauce in to hide the fact it was dish water! The Pad Thai had no flavor at all! \n\nI am usually not this harsh but on top of the food being less than mediocre, we were all sick the rest of the day! What a way to spend your Birthday! We will never go back there again!!"
0,"Prices at mad pita are pretty cool, the service is great, there's fishes floating around in vases on the table...\n\nAnd...my gyro meat wasn't roasted and carved off the spit how I like it :(\n\nGyro meat is in strips and fried on a skillet top; not how I prefer. The lettuce and veggies were fresh, the tzatziki sauce was yummy as was the feta, but the meat and boring pita killed my gyro experience. Boyfriend got the falafel, he said it was yummy, overall more satisfying than my meal (as usual).\n\nNot sure if we will head back for round 2...I need my satisfying gyro fix! \nI ordered the baklava for dessert, it was a little different than the traditional Greek style I have had before. Really buttery but otherwise a little bland."
0,"The food is average.  They have a few items that are just fine, but the pizza is really not that good.  The service is always good and the price is fine, so if you need something quick it's not a bad choice just don't expect much."
1,Yum! Beef Brisket & Pulled Pork are my two top picks! Ribs were a bit more firm than I prefer. Chicken was moist & flavorful as well.\nMy far my favorite item here are the Baked Beans w/smokey pork chunks!
1,"Great food at good prices. Excellent decor, it's definitely unique. Awesome coffee for you java lovers."
1,"All four of our current pets (2 dogs, 2 cats) are patients at Hopi and we couldn't ask for better care! My childhood cat, who passed away 4 years ago, was also a regular.  All have had various medical issues and currently, our oldest cat goes in once a week for IV fluids. The same two nurses take excellent care of him and from what I can tell, are happy to see him each time. Dr. Pruden genuinely cares about each animal that walks in that door, is thorough, friendly and personable. I 100% recommend her and value her opinion."
1,"This is a cool, little joint downtown. \n\nLacks pretension. \nJust friendly bartenders, good drinks and plenty of seating at the bar.\n\nThere is a large patio out back and word is they are installing a retractable roof on the patio which will be a nice addition.\n\nLate night it gets crowded and clubby, but I'm usually  out the door by the time that starts in. \n\nA refreshing change of pace from some of the other bars downtown that tend to think  a little too highly of themselves."
0,"This place is the poster child for poor customer service.  I went here to purchase an accessory for my smartphone.  I was not greeted at the door by any of the eight store employees.  Granted three were actually helping other customers.  Two employees were adjusting phone displays which left three employees to acknowledge the existence that someone had stepped into the store.  I continued back towards the accessories and proceeded to look at the accessory that I came into the store to purchase.  I then waited in the hopes that someone would acknowledge me.  I even made eye contact with store employees.  Still nothing, I decided to exit the store with my daughter.  When I was walking out I stated to the employees at the counter, \""Thanks gentlemen\"".  They then acknowledged me.  That upset me more than anything.  I attempted to voice my discontent when a gentlemen who looked more like a tattoo artist than a retail employee turned and just walked away.  Another gentlemen, that's a stretch, just proceeded to talk over me and stated I should have just approached him.  What?  You work in customer service.  You need to be active.  I went to the Chandler mall store and they were great.  Avoid this store on 54th as if they all have the plague.\n\nThe difference between the two stores was in the employees - Chandler Mall (professional), 54th Street (Bouncers at a dive bar)"
1,"Had Valarie Phillips do my hair today and she did a wonderful job! I love my hair do and the color! Excellent at coloring! I will return again and again for more styles, colors and cuts! Love it! And everyone who work at this salon are extremely friendly and knowledgable. Ill be referring all my friends and family!"
1,"I had never had a scotch egg before and this place has them. Needless to say, I had to try one. It's basically a soft boiled egg wrapped in smoked beef(?) and deep fried, so this sucker is the size of a tennis ball, so it's a great appetizer to split.\n\nThen we had the mussels and frites --- Two yummy beers (Belgian Style, proper) and made ourselves get the sticky toffee pudding after watching someone next to us nom pretty hard on one. All very good, we were completely sated and happy. \n\n\nThe wait staff was really attentive and oddly --- the bathrooms were awesome and clean. Weird thing to notice but, ever since this health inspector told me \"" I always look at the bathrooms in an establishment first, and 98% of the time it tells me everything I need to know about how clean the kitchen is too\""  I always gotta check 'em out."
1,This is one of my favorite pizza places. We go here every Friday for lunch. I'm a big fan of the meat pie or the hawaiian special. Definitely something to check out.
1,Rented space here for a couple years. Clean and convenient central Phx location. Great staff. Would highly recommend.
0,"Went to Nofo with a group of friends on a Thursday night before we headed to a concert at The Visulite.  This was probably my 3rd or 4th visit there.  Until then I had always had a positive experience.  Good food, nice atmosphere, good service.  But during our last visit we had a less-than-stellar experience.  We waited for close to 15 minutes before someone came to get our drink orders.  We then waited another 20 minutes for them to take our food orders.  We were there almost and hour and a half before our food arrived. By then we had to scarf down our food in order to make it to our show. \n\nI think the most frustrating part of the experience is that they didn't seem to be particularly busy and seemed well staffed.  In addition, we had to plead with our waitstaff to get another drink.  We payed our bill and rushed to our show.  \n\nTypically, you would think that 2 hours is plenty of time to have a drink, eat and make it out with time to spare.  I can't say I really got a chance to enjoy the food.\n\nI'll probably give them another chance because everyone has their off days but they won't be my first choice next time we head to The Visulite."
1,"Excellent meat.  Excellent cheese.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff to guide you through it all.  This is a place with a clear focus on what it wants to be, and it succeeds!  I highly recommend asking for help and advice as the folks here really know their stuff.  My personal favorite was the goat sausage, but the extra thick bacon sliced to order was a close second."
1,"I have to say when it comes to Stingrays sushi and service, they are the best. Some reviews on here talk about the price of the rolls but why on earth would you want to be eating cheap raw food? Their menu is affordable especially during happy hour and the food is awesome. My server, Bri was suggesting items to my blind date who was a sushi virgin and he loved her recommendations. Overall great atmosphere and sushi at Stingray!"
1,"This outlet is inside a series of warehouses so it might be hard to find without a gps system. We went here once and ended up buying a tv stand. It also helped that the salesperson offered an additional 10% off. \n\nThis is a single floor warehouse but it's huge. Couches, loveseats, sectionals, recliners, chaise lounges, tables, dressers, tv stands are what you will find here. Signs are posted on the pieces. Several friendly, helpful salespeople are there to assist you (cashier), as well as people to break down the pieces and load it up in your vehicle. \n\nLots of choices here. Some pieces are reasonable. Some pieces are a bit high. But you decide. Worth stopping here for a look. Might not be easy to walk around for those of you who need assistance (walkers, wheelchairs), due to the close proximity of the couches and sectionals."
1,Omg this show is incredible... Amazing choreography music and all around fun... Then i got a backstage tour what an amazing night...
0,"If you are craving a really awesome burger, or an authentic shake,this is NOT  the place for you! However, if you're on a tight budget and have picky kids that have no sense of taste then go for it. I got the steak guacamole burger, it was only $5.95. You get what you pay for. It was \""meh\"" but it did fill the belly. Especially didnt like the skinny fries. I also ordered the chili for $1.95 and all I got were beans and pepper soup. Kid meals are $3.95 and milkshakes taste like they scooped ice cream out of a carton and put it in a glass."
1,"Excellent burger, excellent onion rings, excellent sweet potato fries with pineapple dipping sauce."
0,"I decided to get a burger while waiting for my connecting flight at the Phoenix airport as I was pretty hungry. A quick walk around the terminal led to Deluxburger which had a menu focused on burgers so decided to give it a try.\n\nI got the classic burger($11.50) and chocolate shake ($6.50). Like every other restaurant at the airport prices were almost double of what you would pay outside. After ordering it was almost a 15 minutes wait to finally get the food.\n\nThe burger itself was pretty big but not huge, with a lot of stuff thrown in between the buns. I could comfortably lift it and bit into it without making a big mess. There were two problems with the burger. First the patties were overcooked so were dry as a bone. Secondly the burger was over-seasoned. It had so much salt that I could not taste anything else on the bun, just the taste of salt in every bit. After a couple of bites I could not bear this torture anymore so I gave up and trashed it. The chocolate shake on the other hand was very pleasant. It was not too sweet yet sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. I would have personally liked the milkshake to be a lot thicker but this was easier to put down.\n\nOverall not very impressed and will look at other options the next time I need to get something to eat at Phoenix airport."
1,"Timely, very professional, and most importantly affordable!"
1,"Recommend it. Made me horny, enjoyed the performances and the hot chicks, appreciated the sensuality, what else is there? It's Vegas and if you're a couple mos def something good to wet the appetite, if you're into that like me. =P Our seats were at the front row but on the left side of the stage. Nice views that were closeup and intimate, but I've heard it's better to sit in the middle and further back to see the full scope of the stage. I dunno about that but I enjoyed the close up view myself. Pricey but worth it, afterall it's Vegas baby!"
0,"I've had WAYYYY better experiences. We chose this place based on their location to the Salt River Fields for Spring Training.\n\nWe called ahead of time to see if they could handle 3 pedicures & 1 manicure at the same time. They said \""Yes, come on in.\"" Um, no. There were only 3 ladies working, and one was already busy. What should have been a 45 minute trip to the nail place, ended up being an hour and half!\n\nThe ladies here are not friendly, and they are slow. My toes look like I could have painted them myself. They severely lack color options for regular polish and gel. The space is average -- clean and newer pedicure stations, but the seats were not very comfortable. I would not come back again nor recommend to a friend."
1,"One of the better Indian Restaurants in Pittsburgh (among a lot of bad ones). Very solid fresh food, with an outstanding selection of beer on tap (20 choices, including the only cider on tap I have seen outside of Vermont and NYC). The Chicken Makhani (Butter Chicken) and Lamb Seekh Kabob both stand out as excellent, as do the Samosas and Onion Naan. The quality of the chicken can be hit or miss, and they are terrible about keeping the water glasses full (maybe because they are metal and can't see when they are empty). The Sunday Buffet is a great value, and they offer a late-night half-off which attracts a large student crowd. Just be aware that the flat screen TVs that show Indian music videos, can be turns up very loud, but they are usually happy to turn down the volume if you ask."
1,"Sherrie watched our large, rambunctious dogs while we were on vacation in California.  I can't remember the last time I've been this happy with a dog sitter (and having lived in different areas of Vegas, we've been through a few)!\n\nSherrie didn't bat an eye at any of our care instructions.  She was very conscientious of our departure and return times, and worked with us to fit in a dinner feeding when we got stuck in traffic on the way home.\n\nDuring the trip, we received multiple texts and pictures, which really set our minds at ease, as our dogs can be a bit anxious when we're gone.  But they obviously had a great time with Sherrie, because they were very happy and well-exercised when we got back.  Sherrie also kept paper notes on each day, which was a nice bonus, even though everything went as expected.\n\nNow, I find myself unreservedly looking forward to our next trip, instead of worrying about stressing out our dogs.  Thanks Sherrie!"
1,"After spending some of my training for a half marathon in woefully inadequate trainers, which were really meant for hiking, I started casting about for proper running trainers and landed on the doorstep of Run 4 It.\n\nService was prompt, they seemed to really understand their products and had a great variety of trainers. With prices starting around \u00a365-70, they weren't cheap, however, to make it round a half marathon course with your feet in a healthy, happy condition is surely the dream?!\n\nNow, my favourite bit! They have a treadmill...attached to a computer and camera...and they film you running! The physiotherapist in me was brimming with jealousy as I wanted this kit in our gym. Once they had looked at my running gait in slow motion (very interesting to see this by the way!) the staff were able to try different trainers (more treadmill running, filming etc.!) until we found the perfect one!\n\nAs an extra bonus, Run 4 It were affiliated to the half marathon I'm running and therefore gave me a 15% discount. Very happy days!\n\nIn addition to trainers, there is a large selection of running clothes, equipment and electronic gadgets (for timing, heart-rate monitoring etc.) and plenty of advice on hand from the very helpful staff.\n\nI can't wait to get running with my new trainers...half-marathon, here I come!"
1,Very unique and tasty food.  The service was okay and timely.  I had the steak tacos which were very good and wife had the grilled chicken on a bed of grains and lentils (very very good).  The Pumpkin bundt cake was insanely good.
1,"A group of 10 of us came here for dinner during the week on a last-minute reservation.  They were very accommodating. Ambience in the dining room is nice but nothing special.\n\nAppetizers: We had crab, oysters and calamari at the table.  I didn't eat the first two (not my thing) but others said crab was good, not mind-blowing.  The calamari was fantastic, no chewiness and cocktail sauce was great.  \n\nMain course:  I had grilled halibut steak, which was absolutely kickass; cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and HUGE. I could barely eat half of it.  Others had parmesan halibut (she loved it) Mahi (he liked it very much) and steak (she loved it). \n\nSides:  Everything here shined.  Roasted corn was BOMB, green beans were perfect, and their signature mashed taters with crunchy topping were great.  Why I don't make my mashed potatoes with a crunchy topping I don't know. \n\nDessert:  we each had a few bites of their tres-leches-like cake (not sure what the actual name was) with a caramel sauce on top which I could've eaten two servings of.  We also tried their key lime pie, which was good, but not out-of-this-world or anything.\n\nOverall, very good experience and I would definitely go back!"
1,"OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...\n\nReview #17:\nthis place is huge!; the story about getting lost in the casino rings true here; I actually got locked out of the place during my exploring, but luckily an employee rescued me and let me into the adjacent convention center (which is quite grand as well); there is a walkway to the 3 Signature Towers of high-end condos; the outdoor/pool areas are extensive & top notch; love the massive hotel lobby with the classic MGM lion sculpture; many scenic high end eateries, including 2 Joel Robuchon restaurants; the West End bar is kind of dark & sexy and tucked away, but not always open; armies of hotties headed to Hakkasan nightclub - wowza!; best craft beer bet = Michael Mina's Pub 1842 for sure, but you will pay to play!; Tap Sports Bar also has a few, but prices aren't much better there"
0,Food is good but had a gift card and apparently they are location specific gift cards very stupid u offer gift cards they should be good at all your locations even if they are independently owned and operated
1,"Church Brew Works provides a traditional beer hall atmosphere in a transformed church.  For a local craft brewery, Church Brew Works does offer some very tasty options on draft and what I would consider to be the best beer flight in Pittsburgh - in terms of tasting experience.  From a brewery standpoint, Church Brew Works certainly does not disappoint. \n\nFrom a food perspective, the brewery provides the standard pub options that would be expected.  There aren't many stand out options on the menu, but it is certainly not difficult to find something to hold over ones appetite between pints of the enjoyable craft beer.  The food selection leaves more to be desired, however, the food taste is pairs nicely with the beers on tap. This is certainly a location where the drink rules supreme and the food merely follows.  A great location for an evening out with friends or for private events."
1,Small and quaint. Loved this place. I had the most delicious Espresso Macchiato and Heath Bar Fudge. This place is owner operated and he was so warm and welcoming. Would definitely recommend the coffee here. Was such a nice surprise to be welcomed by Todd (owner). He's worked over 2000 days in a row. Interesting story.\nCash only but have an ATM inside.
1,"I will never be satisfied by another chocolate of any kind ever again.  It's like having an expensive intercontinental perfect date with your celebrity crush.  Your normal life afterwards just won't do it for you anymore.\n\nSeriously this is the stuff of magic!  My girl goes nuts with the samples there.  I'm obligated to spend over 50 bucks every time we come here.  Anniversaries, birthdays, Mothers day, this is the only chocolate she will accept.  Even the other \""fancy\"" chocolatiers won't do for her.  I've created a monster.\n\nThe owner crafted these lux candies with regional ingredients from the spice markets of the world.  The combinations of flavors are intimately chosen and not too richly overtake the truffles or bars. They are voguely packaged in eloquent lilac boxes wrapped with a silky purple bow.  The ornate design adorning the box itself is an artful touch.  Even the bags that are given are some of the most embellished and decorated I've ever seen.  They spent so much detail in the entire package and the product is definitely being treated deservedly.  You couldn't give these as gifts any better if you tried to wrap it yourself.\n\nI suggest starting with a mini bar collection or small exotic truffle box to find which flavors are the ones for you.  Some like the Naga curry, some like the bacon bar, I like the chili dark bar.  *If you want a white chocolate champagne truffle with a gold leaf on top than ask for the Hip Hop Collection.  So fancy!*  There are floral truffles, caramel sea-salt truffles, ginger & wasabi truffles.  The list goes on and on and so can I.\n\nExquisite uniquely selected and masterly crafted.  None like it in the world."
1,"Beautiful breakfast this morning! Everything is so fresh and tempting. In the end, I went for the Bircher muesli and was not disappointed. The coffee is of a good standard as well...something I find hard to come by, having lived away from Melbourne for a year now.\nI am planning to go back for lunch at some stage during my Edinburgh visit. The sandwiches looked amazing!"
0,This was quite bad. Do yourself a fbir ad drive an extra 5 miles to Signal Butte and the 60 if you must have crappy buffet food. At least that place is decent.
1,"This place is a carnivores delight!\n\nI had previously been introduced to this place by co-workers while on a business trip to Texas. I finally got a chance to introduce my wife to this place when we were in Vegas a couple of months ago and she loved it! \n\nThe servers run around with meat on a stick to put it plainly and you can have as much of it as you want. There are usually 12-15 kinds of meats there including, chicken, lamb, steak, pork, sausages, you name it! Aside from that, there is a full fledged salad bar with I would think 20+ items and of course a full bar. \n\nUnfortunately other Brazilian steak houses in the bay area do not compare to this one. I will most definitely eat here every chance I get!"
0,Sloooooowwwwwwwww. Couldn't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food.
1,"Came here with a bachelor party I organized. If you're looking for a quiet, fine dining experience, this is NOT the place. Like the rest of the Palms, it's geared towards the younger affluent crowd - almost like ultralounge meets steakhouse. The food was great, but expect to pay a premium. Not much else to say. Enjoy!"
0,"Let me start by saying that I would have given the casino alone a 3 . . . but unfortunately the casino gets rated with a hotel that I won't stay in again.\n\nCASINO...\nVery elegant, in keeping with the theme.  And HUGE.  It's pretty much _too_ big; it's easy to get lost inside regardless of the plentiful signage and any cockiness you may have about a sense of direction.  There's an excellent selection of restaurants throughout, but nearly all on the extremely expensive side.  Also, despite the size of the place, it's somewhat cramped and airless by all the machines, tables, and people crammed inside (and searching for a door...).\n\nHOTEL...\nSlowest.  Check in.  Ever.  The desk had a full complement of staff, but each employee across the board was taking 10-15 minutes per customer.  I wondered if this might just be overkill on customer service, or maybe even slow computers (I was ready to give benefit of the doubt), until my turn at the front of my line when I discovered that no, it was just slow staff.\n\nEach floor of the hotel is beautiful and airy, especially the central area near the elevators from which the spokes of the hallways radiate.  The rooms are . . . okay.  They're rooms.  Simple, but nicely decorated.  The pictures on the walls are nicely framed black & white photos of stars of stage and screen.  (Some are a bit dark and creepy, but most are nice.)  But the feel is _old_.  The fixtures are not ageing well, from chipped, scarred, and stained chairs, to chipped, scarred, and stained bathroom fixtures.  (I was a little concerned about the toilet.)  The beds are beautiful and supremely comfortable, but otherwise I definitely felt let down by the quality -- I just expected much more.  Plus, for a non-smoking floor, there was a constant definite smell of cigarette smoke in my room.\n\nOverall does the job as a hotel, but the old-school Tinseltown elegance has definitely faded.  With all the other options around, I won't stay here again."
1,Fun course. Check out the night golf during the summer. They have a range too.
1,"Outstanding company to partner with!  Very professional, very responsive, and very technically equipped.  Quick at addressing the customer's concerns and/or needs.  Would have given 5 star rating, however installation was delayed a bit, at their request.  Also, (outside of the installation itself), more on site work performed than normally would have preferred.      \n\nFinal product was a beautiful maple custom home entertainment center, designed exactly to our requirements at a very reasonable price.\n\nWould definitely recommend!!!"
0,"Don't waste your money.  I've had several manicures/pedicures in my lifetime, and the service here was surely the worst. They were rude.  Jenny HURT my foot when she was shaving off the calluses because SHE WAS LOOKING THE OTHER WAY.  Not even paying attention to what she was doing.  That happened twice.  I usually do my gel nails at home, but thought I'd give myself a treat by going here.  Wrong.  I could have done better than Lien.  My fingernails were filed crooked, as were one of my toenails -- if I hadn't noticed and had Jenny straighten it out.  Very unhappy with the service here.  Groupon or not, I will NOT go back."
1,"I have been a regular at Copper Star for the past 3 years.  I love the uniqueness of this place - the drive thru with cheerful baristas (os) and  the owner (Bill)  is actively involved in the community and knows his fellow business owners.  Nicest guy you could ever meet. \nOk.   Now let's get down to business. Coffee-\nEveryone has a different taste in coffee. I love this coffee so much that I buy their beans by the pound.  It usually is a mix of Ethiopian, Guatemalen and Sumatran or other roast.  Anyway - I can't say that I have been to  a whole lot of different coffee bars in Phoenix,  but the ones I have been to don't  measure up in flavor, freshness and robust flavor of the beans. Nor can anyone  match  the friendliness and unpretentiousness of the staff. \n\n I have only tried the scones and muffins.   Scones are a difficult feat in most places but Copper Star has some of the tastiest.  Try the chocolate chip or cranberry walnut scone.   During the fall they make homemade pumpkin muffins  (using fresh pumpkin) that are to die for.  They run out so fast you have to get there early.  I wish they would offer these year round.Yum!    Because of the coffee, service , and the limited # of goodies I have tried so far, plus their community involvement,  I am giving this place 5 stars.\nThe patio is very small  with a nice fountain and you can bring your dog - After your coffee take Fido across the street for a bath at Wag-N-Wash (but that is a different review).  So, if you happen to be in the neighborhood stop by and check out Copper Star.  You'll be glad you did. \n(Say Hi to \""Mr Bill \"" for me!)"
1,"I scheduled my appointment via phone for my two cats.  All I needed was to get their claws trimmed and their teeth brushed and the guy scheduled me.  When I went into the store they didn't even ask me my name.  They saw I had a kitten (was only able to catch one of my kittens, the other wouldn't leave the house that day) and immediately took care of her.  Obviously it's mostly dogs, and as the guy said on the phone, if there is a cat in there they will do them first because they don't want the cats stressing out.  Love that!  So I got Zoey's claws trimmed, and to my dismay, she was being a lot easier on this professional!  I felt betrayed, Zoey is always giving me a hard time when I clip her claws.  Then I asked about the teeth brushing (this is where 5 stars goes to 4) and the lady said that cats don't need their teeth brushed because the foam doesn't work the same way it would for dogs.  Now, this is the first time I've ever heard this.  I've even looked it up before and from most of my reading it says cats should get their teeth brushed (some even say as often as humans).  Maybe that's her opinion, and while I would've preferred her to just brush them anyway, she just gave her some breath-spray instead.  Which is fine.  The customer service I received was great, but it still is confusing to me how the guy on the phone allowed me to scheduled a teeth cleaning but when I go in there, this lady tells me they don't do that for cats.  Hmm.  Just a bit of some confusion there.  Anyway, it was 5 dollars to get the claws trimmed and I was in and out in 5 minutes as well, overall great experience!  All the grooming seems to be done out in the open, which is really good to see, they shouldn't have anything to hide.  Everyone else in there was friendly."
1,Normally I'm a huge fan of Chipotle but this time wasn't the best. My food was cold and they gave my friend the wrong salsa. C'mon Chipotle get your shit together! I'm giving you a 4 for now because of all the other times I've been extremely satisfied here but I will drop you down some stars if this shit happens again!
1,"My LG Front Load washer got clogged up when my house cleaner washed the bath rugs. Never a problem in the past, however this time the backing disintegrated inside the machine - for everyone out there, this is a major DON'T - and the rubber backing clogged everything and I mean EVERYTHING up. The entire washer had to be taken apart and carefully washed out, hoses cleared and then put back together.\n\nLeonard is friendly and knowledgable. He also replaced the ignitor mechanism on my gas stove, and now everything is back to normal and working just fine. No hidden charges, no mess and minimal fuss.\n\nAbsolutely exceptional customer service and Leonard arrived exactly when he said he would. I will definitely be using their services in future (hopefully, not too soon). Always love to support small business owners - and this is one of the great ones. Many thanks."
1,"Had a quick meal here -- ham and cheese on a croissant - and it was delicious.  Fabulous croissant.  Free wifi, great location and all in all, a very nice break."
0,"The service at this Pita Jungle sucks! Sucks. sucks. sucks. \n\n*Sorry for such a LONG review, but really, it's because I want to help you out here. \n\nAnd, It's too bad because the food is absolutely delicious and I love the fun and healthy concept.  Two stars here..one for the food and one just because the whole concept of Pita Jungle totally completes me. I keep coming back for the zesty hummus and that oh-so-creamy garlic dip. Heaven! Warm pita bread never tasted so good except when it's from Pita Jungle. And at happy hour, who can beat less than ten bucks for your entire food and drink bill? \n\nSo what's the problem? I don't know. Ask the servers ...that is..if you can ever find one. I'm a pretty chill customer; if I don't get good service I give the benefit of the doubt and just figure my server likely had a bad day. I'll always give you another chance. But let me tell you what happened on 3 different occasions. I came on separate days; separate times of day; and had different servers each time:\n\nFirst offense: Came in with a group of friends for reverse happy hour on a Friday night. Got seated right away. Took 10 minutes just for a server to come by and get our drinks ordered. No problem, we are a happy crowd just laughing and having a good time. Another ten minutes goes by. Hmmm..getting a bit hangry here.  Finally had to hunt down a server just to place our food order. Ugh. We finally get our food...the hangriness is satisfied. So tasty! But now we need refills. After another 10 minutes of hoping a server would check on us; ask us for a refill, clear up the plates - heck anything? Gosh, we start to feel like we are imposing or something. I tell you what, the place was packed and there were only 2 servers. For a Friday night with packed indoor seating plus an outdoor patio I can tell you that this just doesn't add up. Well, at this point we forget about ordering additional dip or drinks; just give us some more pita bread to finish up what we started here and let's get outta here. Waitress tells me Sorry, but we are closing and the kitchen is shut down. Um? Its only like 5 minutes past. And you know what, if you hadn't made us wait 20 minutes just to place our order we could have eaten and had our fill of it like centuries ago. Matter of fact, we could have left the building and gotten out of your busy way exactly 20 minutes ago. I was embarrassed that my dinner party left the place - still hungry and now late for our next adventure. Thanks a lot.\n\nSecond offense: Just me this time and I popped in for a second chance. Got seated right away. (hey, they got that part down right!) But then the same drama with trying to place my order happened all over again.  (Won't repeat it - just see above. exact same offense) Who is my server? Is anyone coming over? Here is a tip, Pita Jungle. I'm a cool chic, I love the bohemian vibe, and yes, it's totally cool that servers dress in what I shall call 'street wear' ...but if they insist on taking their sweet old time, I wonder if you can just give out a name tag or have them introduce themselves so I know who to hunt down? All I can see are a bunch of folks standing around, chit-chatting with each other. Oh wait, those are my servers hanging out by the bar area. I am all about whistle while you work, but can you just see about taking my order sometime? Well, I'm so happy the bussers here have it together. They were more helpful to bring a water and/or clear my plate than the servers. I guess they weren't elite enough to stand around and chit chat with the rest of the waitstaff. \n\nThird offense: I notice that if you get a seat at the bar, you are literally sitting right across from someone and they can't MISS you at all. I figure this has to be the way to do it. Placing an order, getting a refill, hunting down the bill should never be a problem again. Right? hahaha..nice try! Came in again and plopped right at the bar. Got my food ordered. Check. Alright..I'm off to a good start. Minutes later my food arrives. hey, hey!! We almost nailed it. SIGH. But then..I was forgotten again. I find that after 15 minutes sometimes folks need a refill or a check-in on your meal. (Me, I just wanted a water actually. Well..at first. Then I lost track of all the things I needed because time turned into a quantum leap). I see in front of me 3-4 servers hanging out and laughing amongst themselves. It goes on for...well...ever. I look around the restaurant and the folks at the tables (inside and outside) seem to shift in their seats a bit. Finally I pipe into their private conversation and ask just for a quick water. They all glare at me as if I am completely interrupting them. How could I be so rude? Alrighty then. I'll just pay my bill and leave. Finally just chased down a busser (figured that part out!) and they took care of it. \n\nNo more stars for you. Look at this trend in similar Yelp reviews.  Should I give you yet another chance, Pita Jungle? C'mon, get your waitstaff in order."
1,"We tried the Brunch buffet in pH on Saturday afternoon. The wait was there - around 30 mins. In many ways this is your typical Vegas buffet, but I loved the food and the service. \nI almost paid double the amount for the Cosmopolitan buffet the last time and there was, double the wait, half as much variety, poor service and they stop refilling items after a while. The drink service here was prompt and great. They included all sorts of beer, wine, mimosas, sodas, ice teas, etc. in the brunch. Mimosas were really nice. The staff was friendly and efficient.  \n\nFood - I am usually not a huge buffet fan, but everything that I tried was tasty. They have seafood, breakfast, Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Country and an Asian section and a huge desserts variety. The Mediterranean section had some succulent lamb and chicken options. Tons of vegetarian options overall - , nachos, hummus, soups, salads, 3 types of veggie pizzas, noodles, rice, tofu, veggie spring rolls and much more. The desserts section was fantastic - exquisite cupcakes, candy floss, ice cream, cheesecakes etc. There were also made to order eggs, crepes, pancakes and fresh waffles. \n\nDefinitely give this place a try and don't think twice if you are a vegetarian, you will have plenty of options. If you want a good buffet for a good price, Spice Market is the place to try!"
1,"Now if you haven't been to XS or are coming to Vegas for the first time and want to experience a great clubbing experience...XS is where it's at!\n\n-Sound system is great!\n-Music/DJ is awesome! Usually house mixed with top hits!  Good vibe upbeat and fun to dance to!\n-People who come here are typically good looking and dress for a Vegas club! So ambience is great!\n-Good ratio of men and women!\n-It has a big open area, so if you do not have a table, or even if you do but want to go outside for a bit and sit in the open air...you can!  And you can also find a bigger space to dance but still hear the music perfectly!\n-Club is beautiful! \n-Plenty of restrooms and they are kept up well\n-FUNTIMES ALWAYS!\n\nNever have a bad time or bad experience at this club!"
0,I only give it this because I never seen an apartment I waited for 50 minutes after the leasing agent said 10-15 minutes. She never had the decency to come out and tell  me it will be a few more minutes..  It looked nice but there are many nice apartments. Sorry The Venue we will never do business..
0,"Had the Breakfast sampler of 2 eggs, 2 links, 2 ham, 2 bacon, hash browns, 2 pancakes. Overall? Not tasty and kind of cold.\n\nHowever, since this was my second time to patronize this establishment, I must conclude that this is THE WORST IHOP EVER."
1,Awesome happy hour and the staff is great ! Reasonably priced average plate is between $10 to $15 . Live music every night ! Awesome local talent which sets the mood !
1,"Whenever I come back home and visit Phoenix, this is the number 1 restaurant I want to visit. A ton of healthy (actually healthy, not fake healthy like many 'organic' food restaurants), creative options that are extremely tasty. Always have great service; every, single time (out of a dozen or so visits). Servers have unique personalities.\n\nA little expensive (not too bad), but worth it if you want tasty, healthy food that is a little special, but not so rich that you fill sick afterwards. (healthy, fresh food can be expensive, even if you cook your self)\n\nI've enjoyed everything I've tried, but I especially recommend:\n\nEdamame Dumplings (like edamame ravioli with truffle oil; so delightful and light)\nTurkey Bolognese (filling entree if your hungry for brown rice pasta)\nCrudites: Perfectly al dente veggies \nSalads: Liked all of the ones I've tried!\n\nEnjoy!"
0,"All I had in my mind was a perfectly flaky croissant, but Nova's didn't exactly deliver.  The croissant was okay, but not necessarily flaky.\n\nI also purchased a loaf of french bread but was a bit disappointed as well.\n\nI like that this place is open 24 hours a day and that they have parking, but if I can, I think I'd choose Amelie's over Nova's."
0,"Disapointment! Honestly can't say anything good about the place. \n\nThe food was bad, even for a buffet. Most of the juice machines where down. Fruit wasn't ripe. How do mess up fried chicken and mashed potatoes. On top of all that, most of the ladels had food on them so my hands were left sticky and gross. On top of that, it was over priced."
0,"Is it something about the overabundance of rich people looking for yoga pants to compliment their botox in Charlotte that make the salespeople here so rude? When I'm buying $100 leggings I would expect interactions to be seamless. I got capri pants in LA, where the staff was extremely nice, but the pants needed to be hemmed so LA sent me to Charlotte (traveling a lot). I can't speak to other Lululemons but this one has a voicemail system-ok, fine when they're closed. However, when they're open, they turn on another voicemail system that makes it clear that they have no intention of picking up the phone but may get back within 24 hours. When I'm calling, that's not good enough. When I showed up in person with my question, they were unable and uninterested in helping me hem my overpriced bits of spandex. \n\nI will be sticking with UnderArmor leggings from now on-might not last as long but at least buying them won't sour the soy milk in my stomach. Two stars because the door did not hit me on the ass on the way out."
0,"Prior to Subway in the Desert Foothills shopping center opening I had been going to the one on W. Charleston by Big O Tires. Never had a bad sandwich. Never had bad service. The new one is walking distance to my house so I switched. First visit - 6\"" tuna. Sandwich was all bread and toppings, tuna was so scarce I definitely was eating more bread than anything. Second visit ordered that summer barbecue sandwich. Again I found I was eating mostly bread, very little substance to the sandwich. Third and last time I ordered tuna and once again found myself feeling like I threw away money. Not willing to continue to get screwed just because it's closer to home. I would welcome the opportunity to speak personally to the person who trained the employees but whenever I ask for mgmt they look at me like I'm nuts. If I wanted to just eat bread, they do sell decent crusty French bread at Albertsons.   Sorry guys, but your location does not impress me, especially since I can drive a little bit further and have a great sandwich."
1,"OK, here's the bottom line.  Carlo's bakery is a world famous name.  You are going to have to wait in line and it is going to be crazy inside the bakery, as every bakery should be.  Get over it.  This is a real New York style bakery (which I have seldom found outside of New York no matter what the sign says).  New York baked goods are less sweet than out here and the flavors are more subtle. . . the way it should be.  Everything I had was SPOT ON as far as flavor and presentation goes.  On a scale of 1-10, cheese cake was a 9.  Crumb cake was a 10.  Canaille was a 10 (was pre filled which was a little disappointing but still nice and crispy.  Brownie with nuts was an 8.  Both the carrot and red velvet cupcakes were a 10.  I am a baker and very hard to please.   I say go, wait in the line and enjoy some baked goods the way they were meant to taste."
1,"Have any of you ever had the feeling where you just can't stand another buffet in Vegas?  Or just simply sick and tired of looking at all the food stations with endless possibilities for a potential food coma? (Well I never had that problem but people in my party certainly had that predicament)  So I guess I will just have to follow suit and take in a regular dining facility instead of the glamorous world of buffet heaven.\n\nI've been to a Grand Lux before so it wasn't anything new to me.   It is the sister restaurant of Cheesecake Factory's therefore I have no complaints here at all.  Just like any Cheesecake's you've been to it's got lavish decor, dim lighting, and of course, endless options on their menu.\n\nIt's a typical California (cheesecake factory) fare where you can pretty much get anything and everything.. so here are the dishes that our party have ordered!\n\nPolynesian Salad!  Citrusy flavored dressing with a hint of sweetness all rolled into one drizzled upon a pyramid like salad concoction.  The veggie temple was build with a foundation of mixed greens and tiered off by giant wonton crisps!  It's pretty much the sister version of the Luau Salad at the Cheesecake factory... one of the most delicious salads for a nice sit down restaurant!\n\nGrand Cobb Salad:  It's grand but actually not as large portioned as the Polynesian salad.  It's got all your typical culprits in a cobb (avocado, bacon, turkey, egg whites, etc..) All dressed in bleu cheese!  (I thought it was ranch..  Yuck!  I hate Blue Cheese!!!  However, when I actually gave it a try, the dressing as actually tasty and bearable!  (I simply cannot handle bleu cheese) So that's actually tasty as well!\n\nMadeira Chicken:  Didn't get to try this out but according to our friends, it was tasty!  (I'm not a big chicken breast dish kind of guy so I never order these things)  I'll just take their word for it!\n\nSpicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich:  Same as above as I didn't get to try the sammy, but it was gone from my buddy's plate so that's a good sign!  Gotta try that next time!\n\nSlow Roasted Short Ribs of Beef:  Great BBQ flavor!  It's your typical BBQ flavor dish but definitely tasty!  (With BBQ you really cannot go wrong unless you overcook it which will make it super dry and gross)  But it was nicely flavored, juicy, and delicious overall!  (huge portion too! as it was served with veggies and mash Potato!)\n\nFried Calamari:  Highlight alert!  This is one of the best Calamari that I've ever had in many different places!  They fried their calamari along with veggies and rock shrimp to create the most heavenly dish (one of my all time favorites!) served with ranch and spicy aioli dressing!  I'm telling you, if you were to pick one dish to get at Grand Lux, this one is highly highly recommended!  Oh... did I mention the portion for this is huge?  Well you bet it is!  Totally worth every penny!\n\nLastly, service was awesome as it comes to expected being affiliated with cheesecake Factory.  They brought out wrong salad dressing for me and when I asked for it, 2 different wait staff came out with the dressing!  (Now I got 3!)  Great attention to customer's needs is definitely a plus!\n\nSo there you have it, Grand Lux Cafe, opens 24 hrs, in Venetian or Palazzo, and will serve your morning, noon, dinner, or late night dining needs in case you are totally turned off by the buffets of  Vegas!  A terrific alternative yet decently priced!"
0,"For an upscale restaurant with 4.5 stars and $20 small plates I expected great service, quaint ambience great food and friendly staff. \n\nNote to the owner: your front of house has no business being in a restaurant. Everyone we encountered from the female ma\u00eetre d who was unnecessarily rude and pompous to Our waitress who was awful and had to take our order twice because she couldn't remember?!?!\n\nI enjoyed the pork belly in banana leaves and the lamb chops.\n\nThe appetizer Japanese small shooters were unappetizing.\n\nUnfortunately the service was just so awful it was unforgivable."
1,You have to try the Steak Tataki. It is absolutely amazing!!
0,"When it comes to buffets I like to call myself experienced!! I love them! They are always full of an awesome variety of food and you can never go wrong with the fresh made stir fry.... Unless you eat here\n\nWhat a terrible I mean terrible Dinner Starting off with the worst customer service ever. Vegas is known for there buffets and great food and service at restaurants and other things but we are are talking food here! \n\nI kid you not after about a 15 min wait in line which is typical for buffets around dinner time so I'm not complaining about that but what started the hatred was the simple fact that it took 45 min to get our drinks. Yeah ok we had a table of 9 including kids but seriously 45 min to get water and a soda. We all were on our second go around of plates and ready to make the third trip down when we finally got our order of drinks that was placed when we first got there. Then to top it off as normal we finished our drinks fast yeah we were thirsty the lady took roughly 15-20 min To come back to our table with our refills. At this point I asked if she could just bring us a pitcher of water. Which to our surprise was pretty fast. (Now after you read my rant go through there pictures and witness first hand the nasty filthy pitcher she put on our table.) as we examine the filth inside and out and with the disappearance of our server again we decide to go to the front and ask to speak with a manager. Lady says what table are you ok I will send the manager there. 10 min 20 min 30 min 45 min go bye and finally after the waitress who just sees all of us sitting there asks If there is anything you need. At this point we say yes the manager that we have been waiting for! Now side note I'm not one to complain and moan but when it's bad it's bad. Finally after over 45 min the manager comes to our table we explain to her our issues with the wait for her, the drinks, the terrible service the terrible dried out food....which I've yet to rant about... The dirty nasty pitcher were just a few things that we laid into her. Much to our surprise She begins to defend her staff and say well thats not what she said, and on and on... lady look at the pitcher and examine the situation before you speak... then she goes on saying well you asked for a pitcher.. Damn straight we asked for a pitcher of water. Well I'm sorry sir but we don't give pitchers here. Ok wtf you did and look at it. Yes sir it appears to be dirty but again we do not give out pitchers and sir the water is clear... Wait what did she say. The water is clear so what my dogs bowl water is clear and you don't see me drinking Out of there bowl! Anyway she results to saying after she finally examines the situation and sees that it's been bad she lays into the server and basically tells her off she says well I can give you 2 comps and you can eat here again for free....um let me think about that. The service was terrible, the dish wear was filthy I mean so bad I wouldn't let my dog use it, the food was less than mediocre... hmm yeah I would love to come back said no one ever!!"
1,"Earl of Sandwich is @ Planet Hollywood.\n\nTried the Full Montagu sandwich and was not hungry after that.  Really big portion.  Full Montagu is - Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce.  Pretty darn good.  Shared a salad - the Caprese Salad - \nField Greens & Romaine, Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, Roma Tomato, Fresh Basil & Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Very fresh salad."
0,"The food wasn't bad, but it was incredibly slow service. It took forever to place an order and there was no one in line. I probably won't be back .. I can't stand slow service"
1,"I was in LV for my wife's birthday and was looking for a good restaurant at the Bellagio for dinner.\nSo I used Yelp and choose \""Le Cirque\"" thanks to its great ratings.\nThey are deserved!!\nThe food was delicious and the place very comfortable knowing that you are on the Strip. \nI would have actually give them 5 stars if rating only the food. But the service was mediocre compared to the rest. The waiters were trying too hard to sell you the most expensive part of their menus. And the 2 French waiters were just purely annoying; being pretentious and anything but nice. True French waiters after all (I lived for many decades in France)!!"
1,"The good people of Superior Process Service are professional and understanding. I needed papers served for a family court case, and they were able to do this on their first or second attempt even after the individual in question suddenly switched to another address. They worked with me extensively, even calling me on a Saturday to coordinate and make sure they had all the right papers. I would highly recommend this process server to anyone wishing to have papers served in a timely manner by conscientious people."
1,"My entire family has gone to Doc for years. He's wonderful.  He is the kind of dentist that puts everyone at ease, including those who need extensive dental work.  Dr. Garhardt is professional and down to earth.  He once came in outside office hours to help my poor husband who had (unbeknown to us) an abscessed tooth.  He'd just returned from a fishing trip, it was a Friday night, and it was either the ER or Doc's office.  He's just that kind if guy.  He goes out of his way to take care of his patients.  I believe he also takes just as good care of his staff, who are always warm, welcoming and helpful.  Dr. Garhardt also cared for my disabled father, going above and beyond to ensure his comfort and care were top-notch. \n\nRecently my family relocated to Denver, and we are sad that Doc won't be our dentist any longer, but I had to write a review acknowledging his practice.  Anyone on the Las Vegas/Henderson area would be well served to seek out Dr. Garhardt!"
0,"We've been here a few times.  I am not a fan.  But my wife generally likes frozen yogurt, so I'm rating based on her comments.  She's not a fan either.\n\nThe selection is pretty limited, it's very pricey (hey, mall space ain't cheap!), and the staff is usually disinterested.  We had one young lady who was enthusiastic, but the others have always been chatting with someone else and very apathetic to our presence.\n\nMy wife has tried several flavors, but so far has only liked the pistachio (she says that one is \""four star\"").  All the others she says \""meh\"".  The toppings bar?  Doesn't look nice.  Sorta reminds me of the nut bowl on the bar in a lounge/bar. You just don't even want to touch it.\n\nAlas, we have a pre-paid card to use up, so we'll be back.  Hopefully they'll have more pistachio for her.\n\nOh...the pre-paid card is, in effect, a \""get one free\"" deal.  You spend $20, but the card is valued at $25.  I believe.  (My wife carries the card.)  We got it on our first visit (when she had the pistachio) because it was a decent deal.\n\nAll in all, I much prefer Frost Gelato."
0,"BANG BANG BANG on our door at 4 am by the front desk clerk!!!  Why? Ok, let's start at the beginning.  Phoenix has an overabundance of budget adequate chain motel/hotel rooms, and we figured this was one of them.  When we arrived the day before Thanksgiving, 2011, we found a full-on construction site, so much so that we could NOT find the way INTO the hotel.  Eventually a workman snaked our way though to an incomplete lobby and we went up to our room.  AT FIRST LOOK, this newly redecorated room looked and smelled clean, and even had a somewhat upscale interior design for a budget motel. (This Ramada is becoming a Holiday Inn we were told).  But it was downhill after that.  The water was turned off and we did not have water until three hours after we arrived.  We turned on the air conditioner because it was in the 80's and the window does not open. WELL, we might as well have been in an airplane test hangar because it is SO unrelentingly LOUD that you cannot hear the TV...at all...and I have great hearing.  We eventually realized that the Air Conditioner / Heat Pump individual unit, while there IS a wall thermostat, only has ONE setting and...it is HIGH. (Lo and Med still blast at HIGH intensity).  Little by little, the fault became apparent to us...this was a cosmetic touchup, but the important things were missing like....a BATH TUB...there is no tub, just a shower with a shower head that barely yields a dribble of water....the TV is an old TUBE TV and it is blurry and scrambled and two calls to the desk (no one answers the extensions) brought no results.  Speaking of the bathroom, there is no window, no fan, and an ill-fitting toilet seat that shifts loudly to one side each time you \""alight\"".  Many have complained about their odd shoji pocket door to the bathroom which bounces back open, and clipped my husband's hand twice. As others have mentioned, there are paperthin walls APPARENTLY, because we woke up at 4 am to watch the news.  We are very conscious as we live in a condo to keep our TV down.  Nonetheless, with this HORRENDOUSLY loud wall unit air conditioner, if you want to hear the TV, you have to turn it up and we did NOT turn it up as much as we would like to, but....BANG BANG BANG on our door a few minutes after we had gotten up.   The Front Desk Clerk rudely said when I opened the door (which is freaky at 4 am) -\""The neighbors complained about the noise and I could hear it all the way down the hall\"" - **Note to Manager: GOOD LUCK RAMADA/HOLIDAY INN when it is 110 degrees outside and people have their TV's up much louder than we did to combat the a/c on UNRELENTING HIGH.  Trust me, there will be multiple complaints every night.  Other reviews of this motel have mentioned the same complaints.  I was planning on telling the desk clerk when we checked out after 3 nights about some of these \""constructive ideas\"" for their own benefit.  However, the checkout clerk looked like he was NOT open to  input (probably overdosed on complaints), so I refrained.  Basically, the owners have cheaped out on this major remodel. .  If you read this, Ramada/Holiday Inn Manager, at the very least you need to get an electrician to REWIRE the thermostat to get a  LOW FAN setting on the a/c wall unit, buy new TVs, replace the toilet seat, change out the bathroom shoji door and shoot some insulation into the walls.  And, we're just not all that picky!"
0,Checked out this restaurant for my first time this Wednesday evening. I was surprised to see that they are open late so I did some take out around 9pm. \n\nTwo things that need to be emphasized... \n\n#1 Unbeatable price for the amount of food. \n#2 Below average quality. \n\n$7.60 for a take out order of the General Tso's Chicken. That was about the only positive part. The chicken wasn't very warm which made me question if it was made to order. No consistency with the chicken... some dry and crispy...some mushy and soggy. \n\nOverall feeling--- not bad. I guess I can't be too picky when spending seven bucks for Wednesday evening take out.
0,"For the love of pete and moss don't waste your time standing around waiting for this burlesque type show. My husband said he and my son had watched it and wanted to take my dad over to see it. We got down there early to get up front, stood around talking, and had been there about 30 minutes and it was five minutes before show time and suddenly looking around you realize you are packed in like sardines with tons of people. \n\nThey announce they may cancel the show due to high winds. But, no, they go about five minutes late. It is not even cheesy, it is just plain stupid. The girls are pretty the guys are nice looking, it is just really a sad attempt at something, I am not sure what, raunchy rumor? That doesn't bug me, I can roll with the best and some of it was funny, but it was hard to get past because for some reason, it was just so stupid in general. It is harsh, but if it saves you from running all the way down there, it is worth it. I would have never went back if I had saw it once. \n\nMy dad liked it though, of course, girls barely dressed dancing on a stage with some special effects thrown in. That is why I threw an extra star at it, because some people do enjoy whatever that was."
0,"This review is for my recent experience with the RESTAURANT\n\nWe've been to Longhorn many times, and we usually have a great time, $2 blackjack with the loosest rules ever?  Awesome.\n\nI'm just getting home from the worst experience I've ever had at this place, arguably the worst experience in my 27 years in Vegas ever.\n\nWe rolled in there with a group of 6, played some blackjack and all lost our asses (can't blame them for that, it's the luck of the draw),and then went to end our night at the restaurant.  I had to use the restroom so my friends went ahead and got a table...I walked in right as the waiter was finishing up taking everyone's food order.  \nI asked him what the specials were, he told me, and I told him to give me a minute.  \n\nI proceeded to sit there for 30 MINUTES.  I asked the other server there (brunette wearing a red shirt) if I could order some food.  She told me very rudely that she wasn't my server but she would let our waiter know.  Once our server (black male with shaved head) delivered everyone else's food, AND STILL DIDN'T ASK ME WHAT I WANTED TO ORDER, I said screw it, I'm going back to play more blackjack.\n\nAfter I lost more money in a matter of a few minutes, I went back to join my friends at the restaurant, still hoping I could get some food.  I sat there for another 15-20 minutes, watching my friends eat, and making constant eye contact with every employee I saw while I watched them serve multiple tables.  FINALLY when our waiter brought the check, he asked me if I needed anything.  I responded with \""I don't want to order food now, all my friends are done eating and they want to leave\"".  You would have thought I was that dude's worst enemy.  He gave me a dirty look and responded \""I asked you a long time ago\"" (bullshit) , and ran away back to the kitchen.\n\nI told the casino manager on the way out about my experience, telling him that I'm not complaining, and we would probably be back, but I wanted to let him know about the sub-par staff he had at the restaurant.  In his own words he said, \""it was the black guy, wasn't it?\""  Seems like the dude has a history of bad service.\n\nBottom line...a great place to go for cheap blackjack, I'd highly recommend it.  But eat elsewhere.  Right now I'm at home, drunk ,pissed off, and wondering what the hell I'm going to eat since their \""WAITERS\""never even fuc*ing asked me if I wanted anything to eat.  Seriously.  Epic fail"
1,"I was a bit wary of eating in a celebrity chef's restaurant... the tourist trap aspect, etc. Not here... We were blown away from start to finish. Great ambiance, impeccable service, knowledgeable staff, perfectly cooked food, amazingly complex and delicious sauces... and quite possibly the best margarita I have ever tasted (and believe me I have tasted quite a few!!) -- their signature Cactus Prickly Pear Margarita... I'm drooling on my desk just typing about it.\n\nWe showed up on a Sunday night a few minutes early for our reservation and were seated immediately by the stunningly gorgeous hostess. Our server's name was Brian and he was very helpful and attentive without being obtrusive. The bread basket had three different and equally amazing temptations -- an asiago sourdough, a wheat bread with raisins and walnuts, and a marbled corn muffin made from yellow and blue corn meal, with bits of infused pepper, and a great little ramekin of delicious butter formed into a perfect little cylinder. The margaritas came out, delivered by another server, a drink runner I suppose. My buddy ordered a regular margarita and I tried their signature drink, the cactus prickly pear margarita. We were both stunned at how delicious the drinks were. I've had hundreds of margaritas all over the country, and I can't think of another that tasted as good... Margaritas are all about proper proportions of ingredients, and these were spot on. I can only surmise that fresh squeezed juices and masterful mixing knocked these out of the ballpark for us.\n\nOur starters came out -- I ordered the grilled asparagus salad with toasted pecans, maytag blue cheese, roasted wild mushrooms + red chile-mustard vinaigrette. Perhaps the weakest link of the food we ordered, but still very good. My buddy had the crispy squash blossoms with ricotta, corn, sweet and hot yellow pepper sauce. This was the bomb and I was kinda jealous though I did manage to steal a few bites. Portion sizes were good, fairly generous, and the presentations were nice. Go squeeze bottle!\n\nNext came the entrees. I got the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon ancho chile sauce and sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. This plate really knocked my socks off... so tasty, so delicate, so beautifully and creatively presented. And quite a generous portion of perfectly cooked tenderloin. The sauces were complex -- a perfect balance of sweet, salty and spicy. I'm not a huge sweet potato fan, but the tamale, topped with the savory, nutty butter was so delicious. My buddy had the 22oz bone-in chipotle glazed rib-eye with red and green chile sauce. He ordered it medium rare and charred, and it arrived at the table exactly as ordered. It's huge! It reminded us of the steak that tipped over Fred Flinstone's car. I tried a couple of bites and it was amazing. I'm not one who usually eats the gooshy fatty parts, but the charring give it a very pleasant melt-in-my-mouth texture that made me rethink that tendency. For us, both entrees were home runs, knocked out of the ballpark. We also split a chile relleno, which I believe was filled with white cheddar. It was great.\n\nWe were absolutely stuffed and though curious about their desserts, decided to pass. This was a memorable and exciting culinary experience for us both, and I absolutely have new respect for Chef Flay. To the servers and cooks who made this meal so perfect and memorable, I salute you! I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas, for sure. Keep up the good work!"
1,"What a fun and cute little place! For $20 you can get a prefixed menu of sweets! You get a sorbet, a main dessert dish and a small vanilla or chocolate pastry. For $7 extra you can get a wine paring with your main dessert. The desserts are pretty good but the best part of it it's the amount of detail that they have. So many ingredients and decorations that makes this place very unique. The only bad part is that it could take a long time to get your dishes. I went with two of my girlfriends and we all ordered at the same time, but got the dishes at different times.... each five minutes after the other. They did not coordinate and bring all the dishes at the same time, which was very inconvenient! If you are a sucker for warm \""lava\"" you must get the red rock! Instead of warm chocolate it's a soft cake filled with strawberry! It was delicious!! The Mt Fuji was also very good, but you should only get it if you like chocolate and tons of frosting! We also tried the carib which is perfect for someone who is not that into sweets and prefers a refreshing dessert!  Overall, a must try at least once in your lifetime!"
0,"Attention Yelpers: The following review is only based on Maru's AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi.  \n\nAs an avid AYCE or any buffet eating tasmanian devil, I expect the best quality, variety, service, experience in keeping the food coming  and it better be rapidly fresh! \n\nWe had plans to go to Xtreme Sushi at Southern Highlands, but some friends wanted to try Maru in Summerlin because they opened their new AYCE sushi. \n\nGoing into the restaurant was pleasing, venue was clean and plenty of space.  The atmosphere was beautifully designed, however I am reviewing strictly for the AYCE sushi experience...so here it goes. \n \nI must be spoiled from Xtreme Sushi because their AYCE sushi is EVERYTHING on the menu, except for Sashimi (read my review for Xtreme Sushi http://www.yelp.com/user_details_review_search?userid=Oz8Bp1NY-Szz4lvSbVsV4Q&q=xtreme+sushi)!\n\nContrary to my Xtreme appetite, Maru's AYCE sushi was only for selected items! Their regular Sushi menu looked very good and had a variety of appetizers, nigiris and special rolls.  Although going into the restaurant I already knew their regular menu merely did not have as much as Xtreme Sushi; but I went anyway with an open mind to try this out. \n\nTo my surprise and huge disappointment, they gave us a separate AYCE menu with (as mentioned) selected items and I couldn't stomach the fact that I knew I could eat all of the items from their 1 page menu in 2 breathes! Additionally, you had to pencil in what you wanted and advertising with ordering in 2 rounds! WTF??!??!!! I could not believe the fact that I have limitations to my AYCE SUSHI?? \n\nWe sucked it up, stayed and gave it a chance. \n\nFish Quality - \n\nThe nigiri sushi was good, but inconsistent. We had the following items:\n\nEscalor (White Tuna) - The first round was very fresh & buttery, but the last round it was a bit fishy almost rancid. \nUnagi - A little soft and dainty, I prefer mine crispy & well done\nSalmon - was a bit too orange and with a hard layer\nUni (Sea Urchin)- My first time trying Uni in 10 years! I didn't like it 10 years ago but it was very good! \nHamachi (Yellowtail) - I was pleased. Tasted fresh with good quality.\nKanpachi (Amber Jack)  - this was part of the special item which you can only order 1 at a time & only in the 1st  round. My friend ordered and so I wanted to try but at the end, they said they ran out of it! (yeah, right!)\nHokkigai (surf clam) - this was actually one of my favorites. \nRed Snapper - it was better than bad\nGarlic Tuna - I've had better\nAmaebi (sweet shrimp) - It was good\n\nRolls - We only ordered a couple of items, because you can't request 1/2 order rolls like some other AYCE places.\n\nPhiladelphia  Roll (salmon, cream cheese & avocado) - It was decent, perhaps too much sauce\nSummerlin Crunch Roll (vegetables, crab, shrimp tempura, masago topped w/ tempura flakes) - This was also one of my favorites\nUnagi Roll (fresh water eel & cucumber) - Not bad\n\n\nAppetizers - Very disappointing, Xtremely limited items and small portions!\n\nChuka Salad (Spicy seaweed salad) - Very small and I can't even fathom to review the taste because it wasn't enough.\nSalmon Skin Salad - okay\nAnother green salad that they made up - okay\nMussels - the first round it came out warm to cold, as if it was sitting around for a while. The 2nd round was tolerable.\nGyoza - not bad\nTempura - 2 pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of mixed vegetables. We asked if we can have all shrimp and they said \""NO!\""\n\nDessert - They only had a choice of green tea and vanilla\n\nGreen Tea Ice Cream - Normal. They also refused to serve the ice cream to my friends who were done eating with their AYCE sushi, because they were still waiting for our last few items that we ordered! Weird! \n\nService - I am perplexed why they were Xtremely slow because they were not even busy. Furthermore, servers were hawking at us to ensure that we didn't share with our other friend who didn't have the AYCE and only ordered Bibimbap, which she said was very good. \nOne of the servers also blocked and pushed my other friend's hands away because server insisted that one of the sushi she ordered was for her only since they were going by our individual paper menu that we had to pencil in. They also didn't give some of our order at the end and said that they ran out of it. Towards the end, the sushi portion became smaller and smaller! Very disappointing indeed! \n\nI give Maru 1/2 star for some of the fish quality and another 1/2 star for the owners greeting us out as we were leaving. The owners were very nice and said to come back again. I advised them that I couldn't come back because your servers cut me off in my AYCE sushi. She said that she will spank them, so owner well deserved another 1/2 star! \n\nWould I come back here again? Perhaps and only for the korean bbq which I have been told is really good! \n\nOther than that, I will only go to Xtreme sushi because they guarantee to satisfy my Xtreme appetite without any limitations and I get my $26 worth!"
1,We had some cheap seats and at the last minute they moved us to gold circle seating.  So nice and unexpected!  It was great!\n\nThe performance was a mix of talented dancers and acrobats.  Good music and colors!  It was a kaleidoscope of eye candy.
0,"I would give 1 start for this store.I treated in 2 loads clothes recently in  there.I mean 2 LOADS.and they are like new.some clothes are kept in closet and even wear.I am like typle of person like to buy new stuff. .I sold my 2LOADS clothes.the girl told me I can have 90 $ store credit  or 26$ cash.I did not mean to buy anything or exchange anything from this store.because I dont like buy used clothes.but  the cash offer is supper low that I cant accept the cash .

1,"Visited this place the last time in Vegas.  I have to say I'd recommend it. It's in a little strip mall way off the strip, but worth the drive. Everything tasted great and the service was really good."
1,"I've been seeing Dana Price for about 6 months now.  I went in due to chronic daily headaches and migraine headaches.  After a few treatments, my headaches slowly decreased, to a point now where I rarely have one at all.  \n\nIlumina is a fantastic place where the people are caring and understanding.  A very relaxing environment to heal from the inside.\nThanks Ilumina!"
0,"Miserable, through no fault of the staff. There was just something about this particular Target - the worst, angriest, weirdest customers in the world just seem to flock here. There were shouting fights in the aisles and the family in front of me in line left an entire grocery cart full of merchandise there without paying and just walked out.\n\nStrange, terrible place, this Target."
1,"I really like Old Chicago (OC) for a few different reasons. \n\nIf you're a fan of beer like me, they've got a decent line up and rotation of beers (draft and bottle) from all over the world. Also they have this program called world beer tour where you get some free goodies if you drink a certain amount (can we say promoting alcoholism? I'm down). This kinda reminds me of the old program they had going at rock bottom where they would put your name on the placard if you drank like over 100 beers (and you get like tshirts, free food, etc along the way)\n\nSecondly, the pizza is darn delicious there. I know it's a chain, but still great tasting pizzas with variety of toppings. I haven't got a chance to try anything other than the pizzas there, but hey isn't this supposed to be a pizza place? Mama mia. \n\nLastly, it's super close to my school and I have gotten take out a few times so another star for convenience."
1,"What else can I say that no one else has?\nChocolate 10 ways! OK, some other folks have mentioned it but it is worth highlighting again. \nThis is one of their signature dessert dishes that incorporates 10 different style of chocolates into one plate.\nThe different ways: 3 chocolate sauces, marshmallow, ice cream, crumbles, wafers, and more! To put all the elements in one spoonful is impossible, but any variation of the elements are delicious. \n\nOther items that are noteworthy: \n\nAvocado Nigiri - lightly topped with zested citrus and a swipe of ponzu-like sauce \n\nFoie Gras Nigiri - all you California folks... it's worth the drive! ;)\n\nBrussel Sprouts - fried to greatness and tossed in a orangy sauce. Gotta round out dinner with some greens, right?!\n\nGo! You'll thank me..... you're welcome!"
1,"I had a wonderful dining experience here last evening. Staff is really friendly and helpful. They have a lot of vegetarian options, and most everything else on the menu can be converted to a vegan or vegetarian dish. Food is pretty good."
0,"RA is awful. We've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant. No serious complaints about the food, but the service is just atrocious. I admit I'm mildly addicted to the ginger dressing they use on their side salads, but the methadone for that addiction is my abhorrence for the service. I will never go back here, but I may just convince my significant other to pick me up a side salad."
1,"Service was excellent from the start. One of the workers actually opened the door for me, with a smile even, so that was a pleasent surprise. The inside was clean even if it was a little busy. Coffee was very flavorfull and no taste of burnt residue like u find in some other corporate spots. All around I had a great coffee experience and will definetly be back soon. I think it will be my new stop after running the mountain in the morning"
0,"If I could give this Hotel a Zero I would.  I don't know where to start.  I had requested two rooms that were non smoking and connecting.  I called them twice in the morning prior to arrival to make sure they had honored my request.  Upon arrival I was told they had no rooms next to each other, and that the only rooms they has was smoking.  I cancelled one room and all 4 of us stayed in one room.  Housekeeping did not do a good job cleaning the rooms.  The bathroom smelled of urine and the sinks were filthy, not to mention the carpet was not vacuumed at all.  Pluming is definitely an issue.\nTo add insult to the injury, they broke my car key at the valet parking and said it was broken to begin with.  I spoke with the \""supervisor\"" and was told that my key was already broken and that they are very honest (which made me the dishonest one).  \nLong story short, I will never ever stay in this hotel again.\nThe ONLY good thing about this hotel is Gordon Ramsay's burger place."
1,Really delicious food. I was weary when I walked in but was so happy with the curry that I ordered. It's a bit of a drive for me coming from the east side but I'll be back.
1,"Sometimes I just like to go out, drink, dance and interact with strangers all while getting my ear drums assaulted by what can only be described as nasty bass drops. Yes, sometimes I like to go to clubs. And TAO group has almost never failed me in my clubgoing experiences and Marquee was no different.\n\nThe first time I went was a brief walk through essentially-went with a friend who does not handle enclosed crowded spaces well. Yeah. I know. So after a quick walk through we left and I figured I'd never be back because while nothing displeased me at the club, I really only go if I'm guaranteed seating and a place to hide the heels that I've kicked off.\n\nNearly a year later, came back for my best friend's birthday and she had a table (bingo!), so I got to stay, play and experience. I honestly don't know where we were in the club, just at a table, near one of the bars, but we could see a lot of the dance floor action and had a decent view of the DJ's stage. What I liked about Marquee mostly had to do with service. Typically, when you get a comp'd table, particularly with all girls, service is pretty subpar (there are other words I could use...) because the busser and hostess make an unfortunate assumption that a table of girls is not going to tip well. Our hostess did not do that-she was SO nice, came back to check on us frequently and didn't treat us like second class citizens. Even if she didn't want to be bothered with us, she never showed it. So we left her a FAT tip. It's very simple: don't be a bitch, and we'll leave a good tip.\n\nThe music was great, the DJ was fun and someone threw a whole bunch of dollar bills onto the dance floor-so all in all a great experience.  Not sure I would come back without a table because of personal preference, but would recommend Marquee for an authentic Vegas nightclub experience."
1,"The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere. They have happy hour from 5-8 pm, you can actually try different Brazilian appetizer as their menu is pretty decent. You can also have all you can eat salad bar or all you can ate meats. their food is pretty tasty. I still prefer Texas de Brazil but If you don't want to drive far this place is a good option."
0,"The pros are the outdoor seating and the BBQ dishes. Other than that, the food is not good. The BBQ combo platters are really good and you get a lot of food. I have tried other dishes, a grilled chicken salad, and it pretty much consisted of bagged lettuce with five pieces of grilled chicken breast. Outdoor seating is nice, though."
1,Heard about this place from a friend and I am glad that we finally tried it out. Awesome food and awesome service!! Love the old school feel that the restaurant gives. We will definitely be back.
1,"Such a cute, quaint little place!  It's a house converted into a restaurant in Heritage Square in downtown Phoenix.  It's a great place to come for tea.  However, there are very few food items on the menu and they are mostly appetizers.  I would not come here for a meal but rather some tea and a snack."
0,"Uh, as I have over 400 check-ins, I guess I should review this place.\n\nI USED to like the District.  However, because people in Las Vegas are unreasonably lazy, they are now putting a road through the center.  Because, you know, people cannot be bothered to walk more than 10 feet to get their Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.  \n\nAnd, due to the new road, the 10-year-old trees had to meet an early death via chainsaw.  Thanks, you lazy a&*holes!  Now, in their place are palm trees.  How creative!\n\nI hate everyone. Bleck."
1,"I'm a Japanese curry snob and this is the best in Vegas. The flavor of this curry is really exceptional. My favorite part is when I order veggies I actually get big chunks of veggies that appear to be fresh. Other places it is the mixed frozen vegetables which are tiny and that's why it's obvious they were the frozen ones. The rice is cooked nicely, the red and white ginger are nice additions and I like that I can help myself and don't need to ask for it. A 2 or 3 is very hot, a 10 is I don't know, I never got it. I did see someone order it once though, wow. I like really spicy and a 3 is really spicy. I like seeing the list of health benefits listed for eating curry. The food comes fast to the table and has always been consistent. Menu is simple but nice. \n\nI also like that the chef (assuming the owner, but maybe not) always thanks us for coming (at least that's what I think he is doing since he speaks in Japanese). :)\nIf I had a wish, it was that a small salad came with the meal. I also wish for non fried items, since beef chunks is the only protein on the menu that is not fried."
1,"It took a lot of convincing, but we were able to talk the whole MSBL team into going here for dinner one night during the tournament. They complained up a storm about how it was 20 minutes away from where we were staying and some said they just wanted to lay around and do nothing. But, I just stood my ground and told them how great this place was and that they would like it. We made a reservation for 9 for the outside area. The guys were all late, figures. But they had a table for us and it was a gorgeous evening. They guys all got steaks, burgers, southwestern inspired dishes, etc. They ate like they had played all day in the sun. Ok, maybe they earned it. \n\nAnd after it all, they thanked me. They all loved it. The food was just as good. The outside setting was far better than inside the first time, and our servers kept up with this roudy crew."
1,"I heard from family friends that this buffet is the best in Vegas. The setting was nice with the seafood and dessert station in the front. The buffet is in a \""zig zag\"" form starting from the seafood to mexican, italian, and lastly asian cuisines. The waitress was very kind and checked on us for refills. I love their peach iced tea! The best time to come here is for lunch (I think its 37 bucks). Was it worth it? Hell yeah. My top 3 items would be the bone-in ribeye, wagyu slider, shrimp dim sum. I wouldn't say I would come here often, but if you win 40 bucks in the casino then definitely congratulate yourself with the Bacchanal Buffet. \n\nOh btw, I LOVE their desserts! Crepes made to order, cake pops, and PANDAN TIRAMISU....need i say more.."
1,"That's what I needed.  Great sushi, kids loved it.  Tatum is a sushi lover too!  Apps where awesome.   Great spot to watch some World Cup and enjoy some yummy lunch."
0,"After doing my research for a more casual restaurant for a night out in Vegas, I settled on Mon Ami Gabi and was VERY excited to check it out based on all the very positive reviews.\n\nI was sorely disappointed.\n\nOur reservation was at 9PM and when we checked in was told they were running 10 minutes behind.  \n\nWe headed to the bar and once a free spot opened up, we tried to order a glass of wine.  We stood there for about 15 minutes before we were acknowledged.\n\nAt 9:20PM, I checked back in and was told we were the next party of two on the list.  After another 10 minutes our buzzer went off and I moved over to the reception desk and was told our table was not ready.  So we didn't sit for our 9PM reservation until well after 9:30PM but no big deal.\n\nWe sat and we greeted promptly.  Service at the table was great; the food was not.\n\nI ordered the escargot which was average and the French onion soup which was not good.  It was very sweet and bland and there was hardly any cheese.  I was disappointed.  \n\nEverything else food wise was ok.  My fiance got the filet with the red wine sauce, it was also very sweet.  The cheese platter appetizer had one really great bleu cheese, the other two cheeses were average.\n\nExpected much more after all the stellar reviews.  I don't know if it was an off night or what."
1,"The tragically shabby and nondescript Vegas strip malls make LA's look like Manhattan commercial blocks, but there's one that houses Omelet House--and dang, they serve some of the best \""homemade\"" corned beef hash I've ever had. The unique chips and delish pumpkin bread sides along with the perfect over easy eggs help make everything stick to your ribs. Coffee was ok--reminded me of that brand you find in bad motels--\""Chock full o' nuts\""?. Definitely check this place out!"
1,"I'm very impressed by the service here, and the food is pretty damned good. \n\nI'm also impressed how they play nice with the neighboring Crapriotti's, despite the fact that Crapriotti's had people break the Pepe's sign on the building. (Funny, the only sign that got broken on the entire building on a night with no wind, is the Pepe's sign that was advertising Subs, huh?) \n\nWill be ordering from here again, though. Pretty good price for such a huge amount of food. Sean and I have more than enough left for lunch tomorrow."
1,"Love them, great little hole in the wall ! Great tacos, nachos and burritos and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet. We prefer the one on Chandler Blvd. and Dobson in Chandler."
0,"Wlaked into this place and the guy comes out right away, and asks what I need. I tell him, and right about then his cellphone rings. He spends the next 5 minutes on a personal call, without acknowledging me once (\""be right with you\"", \""sorry about this\"", etc). All I did was walk into his store and try to do business with him, so I can certainly see how a personal call should take precedence. This place must have all the work they can handle-- try someplace where they value your business."
0,"We walked in and the place was empty except for one other couple. The hostess/waitress was vacuuming and then mopping the entire place while we were there. They close in an hour. Could it wait until your customers are gone? Finally, the waitress/hostess/ poor woman cleaning was sick as a dog! She was coughing while she vacuumed, coughing while she mopped and coughing while she brought out our food! She should not be serving food to customers let alone working! She was very sweet and we felt bad for the review but she should be in bed. Food was fine but if it comes with a cold..... Yuck!"
1,"A funky old house, I believe, converted to restaurant.  The waffles are amazing (and we eat real waffles at home all the time), the chicken was just as you would expect...wonderful.  A real treat!"
